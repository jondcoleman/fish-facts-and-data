00:00:12,00:00:18,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:18,00:00:26,"from the QI offices in Holborn. My name is Anna Tyshinski and I'm sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:00:26,00:00:30,Andrew Ontemuri and not Dan Schreiber this week. How much are we sharing about the reasons for
00:00:30,00:00:36,his indisposition? Well he did message us this morning saying that he was sick so unfortunately
00:00:36,00:00:41,he's not here but we've all done the research already so we're going to do it anyway. Yeah.
00:00:41,00:00:46,So let's start with fact number one and because I'm hosting this week that is my fact and my fact
00:00:46,00:00:54,"this week is that a rat in Tanzania just retired after preventing 30,000 people from getting TB."
00:00:54,00:01:01,Lovely. So this is a named rat. It's a named rat. It's not like a woman gives birth every six seconds.
00:01:01,00:01:10,Every time I click my fingers a rat retires. Yeah. A rat who's prevented thousands of TB cases.
00:01:10,00:01:15,"It's a specific rat, Carolina. Yes and it's just something to make you all listeners and us feel"
00:01:15,00:01:20,quite underachieving about what we've done with our lives. This is genuinely the effect it had on me.
00:01:20,00:01:29,"Carolina, she's an African giant pouch rat and she screens Flem samples for TB and she does it"
00:01:29,00:01:35,"very quickly, much more effective than humans with microscopes or much quicker and they worked"
00:01:35,00:01:41,"out that over seven years working in this job she's detected over 3,000 cases of TB and that"
00:01:41,00:01:47,means that she's stopped it spreading because it spreads to a certain number of people so I think
00:01:47,00:01:51,it spreads to between 10 and 15 people per infected person. So by screening it you stop it from
00:01:51,00:01:58,"spreading and so she's probably spared 30 to 45,000 people from getting it and probably saved over"
00:01:58,00:02:03,"5,000 knives in her 70 year career. So have they put her in a nice home? Yes, they have actually."
00:02:03,00:02:08,They put her with her friend. They do get a really nice retirement. Wait a minute. This is her friend
00:02:08,00:02:13,"that she's been working with all this time, right? Like no offense to you guys but I don't really see"
00:02:13,00:02:17,my retirement as sitting on a porch and a rocking chair next to you two. Are you crazy? This is
00:02:17,00:02:22,going to be so much fun. I haven't even looked that far ahead yet. I think that's going to be
00:02:22,00:02:27,"brilliant. Yeah, I've found us a spot in Florida. We can park us for the entire home, you know?"
00:02:27,00:02:32,"Yeah, kill them off early, all the other inhabitants. These rats are unbelievable."
00:02:32,00:02:36,They're so cool. I find it absolutely incredible and this is an amazing non-profit company called
00:02:36,00:02:43,"Apopo, APOPO based in Tanzania and Ethiopia and yeah, it uses these giant pouch rats for various"
00:02:43,00:02:48,"things and they have these incredible centers of smell. Yeah, they're faster as well. They can do"
00:02:48,00:02:53,"100 samples in 20 minutes and the human equipment is much slower. Cheaper, I bet."
00:02:53,00:03:00,They are a lot cheaper. They're very unionized. And they pick it up way more. So the classic
00:03:00,00:03:05,"testing method picked up about 60% of cases or for people who had HIV as well, it was only about"
00:03:05,00:03:10,"20% of cases that got picked up. The rats, when they just smell a sample from a patient, they pick"
00:03:10,00:03:16,"up about 70%. So they're really good. And humans have this ability, like in the middle ages, doctors"
00:03:16,00:03:21,"would ask patients, this is really cool to cough on a hot coal or spit on a hot coal and that would"
00:03:21,00:03:26,generate a bit of a smell because it cooks it. Really? And the doctor will use that for diagnosis.
00:03:26,00:03:32,"I think that works. Well, yeah, in the middle ages, famously human lifespan was very long."
00:03:32,00:03:36,"No, but you can smell TB if someone's got a really advanced case of it."
00:03:36,00:03:42,"The Dutch word for TB is tering, which means the smell of tar or it comes from the smell of tar,"
00:03:42,00:03:47,"because that's what it smells like. So yeah, I'm having read this, do feel like we haven't really"
00:03:47,00:03:54,done very much with our lives apart from and I'm now taking out a piece of paper. It's a certificate.
00:03:54,00:03:58,"And Andy, do you want to read this certificate? Oh my god, this certificate recognizes that no"
00:03:58,00:04:03,"such thing as a fish has officially adopted Tamasha, who uses her exceptional sense of smell"
00:04:03,00:04:09,to save lives by sniffing out TB samples in Tanzania. So we have an official no six thing
00:04:09,00:04:15,as a fish. Oh my god. Pouched rat. Where's it? It's us saving the lives now. When do we get to retire?
00:04:15,00:04:22,"So if you want to sponsor a giant pouched rat, then you just go to apopo.org and you can do it"
00:04:22,00:04:27,there. I think it's 12 quid a month or something. So nice. That's the same as the license fee.
00:04:27,00:04:38,"Well, I don't pay that. So I do. We are sponsored today. They actually have not a bad life. They"
00:04:38,00:04:42,are lazy. They only have to work for about 10 minutes a day. I don't really understand why
00:04:42,00:04:45,they make them work so little. They just put them in this glass container and they put the
00:04:45,00:04:50,TB samples. And these are TB samples that have had negative results from the classic test that
00:04:50,00:04:54,"Andy mentioned, which aren't very reliable. So they're very expensive tests, which are very"
00:04:54,00:05:00,"reliable. The classic test is not spitting on a rock. No, there's another test."
00:05:00,00:05:05,"Yes, sorry. It's not the spit on the fire and sniff it. It's the classic cheaper medical test"
00:05:05,00:05:09,that gets sent around rural areas. Not very reliable. So if you get a negative result from
00:05:09,00:05:14,"that, it gets sent to the rats. And then they sniff at it. And because they're so fast,"
00:05:14,00:05:19,"they'll cover enough cases per day in 10 minutes to then stop. And then once they retire,"
00:05:19,00:05:23,"they get this big enclosure. Like I say, she's hanging out with her friends. They have a big"
00:05:23,00:05:28,party. They get cheered. They get carrot cake. They get a good life.
00:05:28,00:05:32,"It sounds amazing. So this place where they are, I think this is the place in Tanzania is in a"
00:05:32,00:05:37,place called Moragoro. And there are all sorts of rats doing all sorts of different things.
00:05:37,00:05:42,It's incredible. Like there's the landmine rat division over here. There's the TB rat division
00:05:42,00:05:48,"over here. Every year, this center gets through 25,000 bananas, 6,000 avocados and a ton of peanuts."
00:05:48,00:05:52,"Literally one ton. It's a mashers favorite food, this avocado. Which that's so nice."
00:05:53,00:05:58,Avocado and banana smoothie seems to be their food of choice. So we'll send to them.
00:05:58,00:05:59,They'll never get there. They'll never afford a house.
00:05:59,00:06:07,"Yeah. So the landmine thing, you kind of glossed over a little bit. But yeah, there are these rats"
00:06:07,00:06:14,that can find landmines because landmines smell a little bit like TNT. And they can smell the TNT.
00:06:14,00:06:21,And what you do is you get two humans and you walk down a stretch where there might be some
00:06:21,00:06:26,landmines. But the landmine's possibly in between you. So you're not walking in a dodgy bit.
00:06:26,00:06:34,And then you tie a bit of rope to your leg. And then the rope attaches to your rat. And then
00:06:34,00:06:39,another rope attaches your mate to the rat as well. And you walk down while the rat sort of walks
00:06:39,00:06:43,between you and sweeps the area. So they don't run away basically.
00:06:43,00:06:47,"Okay. So imagine a three-legged race at sports day, but with the rat in between and the high"
00:06:47,00:06:52,charts are being blown up. Yeah. But also the rope that's tying your legs together is a good few
00:06:52,00:06:57,meters long. You're not that close to your person. Because the rats are too light to set off landmines.
00:06:57,00:07:02,That's the idea. Yeah. The one problem is you have to remove all the vegetation first because
00:07:02,00:07:05,"they're only rats. They're not that big. Well, they're big for rats, but they're still pretty"
00:07:05,00:07:11,small. So the removal of the vegetation might set off the landmines as well. Okay. So those are the
00:07:11,00:07:17,"real heroes of the gardening rats who are sent out. Yeah, they have like these lawn mowing machines"
00:07:17,00:07:21,"that they sent out. So there's no humans involved in those. Oh, like a Zumba. Rumba."
00:07:21,00:07:26,"Like a Zumba rumba. Didn't they say, ""I get knocked down, but I get knocked down."""
00:07:26,00:07:33,"The Epopo team in Mozambique, they've destroyed 13,000 landmines. And Mozambique is now landmine"
00:07:33,00:07:38,free. And they declare that partly because of the work these rats have been doing. And then when
00:07:38,00:07:43,"they have cleared a piece of land, staff from Epopo have to do a handover ceremony to the locals in"
00:07:43,00:07:47,"the area. And they have to run around across the land to prove that it's safe. Oh, really? Yeah."
00:07:47,00:07:51,"Because otherwise, how are you going to trust it? So like you really have to... That's putting your"
00:07:51,00:07:55,"money where your mouth is, isn't it? I'm glad we didn't have tests like that at QI. If your rat has"
00:07:55,00:08:04,"a cold that day, look out. Yeah. Look many eyes, Masha. Do you promise? Before you do any landmine"
00:08:04,00:08:11,"detection, you need to do one thing. I'm the rat. You're the rat handler. Yeah. What do you have to"
00:08:11,00:08:16,"do to your rat before they go out? Make friends? Make friends? No. Not bothered about that. Oh,"
00:08:16,00:08:20,"I would have thought... Business like... Establish a bond. Okay. I mean, tie the rat to you. It's a"
00:08:20,00:08:27,massage. What? Who's massaging who? It's a massage of kind. With a happy ending. Rub your rat's nose.
00:08:27,00:08:32,"Jesus Christ, Adam. Why? That's right. Because they can't concentrate on looking for landmines if"
00:08:32,00:08:38,"they're horny. It's like, you know, football managers stay the day you get it all out of the"
00:08:38,00:08:44,system or something. I don't think Alex Ferguson was doing that to his players. The hairdryer
00:08:44,00:08:48,treatment is actually something completely different. It's trying to go in the order of
00:08:48,00:08:54,"biography, but I'm telling you. Oh my goodness. No, you need to bring us back to reality. You need"
00:08:54,00:08:59,"to rub sun cream into their ears. Oh, really? Why? Because if you look at this picture of"
00:08:59,00:09:05,"Tamasha here, she's got quite... You can see the skin on her ears, right? Oh, that's going to burn."
00:09:05,00:09:10,"Yeah. And they spend a lot of time underground normally. So basically, they can get burnt. And"
00:09:10,00:09:14,"they would get in ear cancer, actually, some of them. Oh, really? In the very early days. So now"
00:09:14,00:09:18,all handlers have to apply sun cream before they go out to work. That's great. Maybe their nose and
00:09:18,00:09:21,"paws too, actually, because those are the bits which are a bit more flashy. That's so nice. They're"
00:09:21,00:09:26,"nocturnal, aren't they? A lot of them. So they have to... That's so sweet. And do you know why"
00:09:26,00:09:30,"they're all so good? The smelling things. The smelling? Yeah. Why? Well, it's all to do with"
00:09:30,00:09:36,their love life. So males have to be able to tell which females are sexually available.
00:09:36,00:09:43,Females have really delayed sexual development. So any males which can tell are at a big advantage.
00:09:43,00:09:47,"If you can tell which females are ready to mate, you're in a much better position. Right. Because"
00:09:47,00:09:53,lots of them aren't. Because lots of them aren't. So there's this weird thing you can measure which
00:09:53,00:09:58,"shows you which males are really, really, really good at this. It's the, I'm sorry to say it,"
00:09:58,00:10:04,it's the anogenital distance. So it's the distance between the rat's scrotum and his bottom. A male
00:10:04,00:10:10,"with a longer one of those, if those two things are further apart, then they can smell the difference"
00:10:10,00:10:14,much better between available and non-available females. This sounds like reflexology or something.
00:10:14,00:10:20,"You get, oh, your anogenital implies that you'll really smell out those ladies. It's to do with"
00:10:20,00:10:25,sexual hormones. So rats which have the sexual hormones in their system have a greater one of
00:10:25,00:10:31,those distances. My rat's got a long anogenital distance. How does he smell? He smells very well
00:10:31,00:10:36,"because of his long anogenital distance. Brilliant. Yeah. One thing I've said before on this podcast,"
00:10:36,00:10:41,"in fact, I think the only time we might have mentioned pouched rats before is the fact that"
00:10:41,00:10:49,females vaginas tend to seal up from time to time. So they are open when they're ready to mate. But
00:10:49,00:10:55,"if they're not going to mate, they close. And also, if you have like a senior female there who's"
00:10:55,00:11:00,"like the main one who's going to be mating, she can send out a signal which makes all the other"
00:11:00,00:11:08,females vaginas close up. And what I didn't say last time is that if a female with an open vagina
00:11:08,00:11:15,"dies, then all of the other females in the area, their vaginas will open. What? No. You can hear"
00:11:15,00:11:22,"a little pop, pop, pop, pop. Imagine a funeral in the pouch rat world. Suddenly all the females in"
00:11:22,00:11:26,"the river are all opening their vaginas. And it really went because we don't have this ability,"
00:11:26,00:11:31,"do we, to close and open them? I mean, as far as I know. No, because they're sealed. Like they're"
00:11:31,00:11:36,"really closed up. Like they're properly closed up. It looks like closing your legs. No, it's"
00:11:36,00:11:44,"like becoming a Barbie doll. It's like it just goes. It's bizarre. We should say while being heroes,"
00:11:44,00:11:49,absolutely disgusting and I still want them all to go away. Because they're huge. They're massive.
00:11:49,00:11:53,"Yeah. They're not rats as well, aren't they? They're not rats. They're not rats. No. I mean,"
00:11:53,00:12:00,"Tamasha here on our certificate, she looks quite like a rat. It looks like a rat and acts like"
00:12:00,00:12:04,"a rat and smells like a rat. Well, probably doesn't smell like a rat. But, you know, to all intents"
00:12:04,00:12:08,"and purposes, it's a rat. But it turns out that they're not related. They're related to rats."
00:12:08,00:12:13,"Yeah, I know. They have bodies, as National Geographic put it, which I liked. They're bodies,"
00:12:13,00:12:21,"so not including their tails, are longer than a 13-inch MacBook Air. What a stupid thing to say."
00:12:21,00:12:25,But you can't say longer than a MacBook Air because they're probably shorter than a 15-inch
00:12:25,00:12:30,"MacBook Air. Well, think of something else. They're longer than a 12-inch ruler. Oh, yeah, thanks."
00:12:30,00:12:36,"You know, I think what that means is they're longer than 13 inches. And so that does mean that"
00:12:36,00:12:41,"with tail included, they get up to 35 or 36 inches long, like three feet long. Okay, that's massive."
00:12:41,00:12:49,One of these pouch rats is bigger than the world's smallest deer in both weight and length. Whoa.
00:12:49,00:12:55,"So that's the lesser mouse deer versus the giant pouch rat. That's striking. Who, I'd watch that"
00:12:55,00:13:00,"fight. Yeah, the rat's easily going to win, actually, isn't it? Yeah, I'm afraid so. No, it's going to be a walk over."
00:13:00,00:13:11,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that while"
00:13:11,00:13:16,"locked away to choose a new pope, cardinals used to be banned from eating pies because it was too"
00:13:16,00:13:22,easy to hide messages in them. So good. I don't think it is easy. Are you joking? It would be so
00:13:22,00:13:28,"soggy. You can't read a message once it's, you know, been drowned in stock. Well, you insert it in a dry"
00:13:28,00:13:33,"bit of the pie, a dry chunk of beef or whatever, or a dry mushroom. I mean, not for you, James, but"
00:13:33,00:13:38,you know. I'm not having any of your pie. It says how dry are your pies? I think the point is it's a
00:13:38,00:13:41,"secret pie, not the point that you have to combine the message and a terrific pie."
00:13:41,00:13:47,"And the other thing, the other thing I banned was whole chickens as well, didn't I? So no. So this is"
00:13:47,00:13:53,"from an article on JSTOR about conclaves, and it was mentioning Chef Colbert Elimeo Scappi,"
00:13:53,00:14:01,"who was catering for the conclave between Paul III and Julius III in 1549. And yeah, according to"
00:14:01,00:14:07,"his description, you cannot send enclosed pastries or whole chickens nor wine in any vessel but of"
00:14:07,00:14:12,"glass that was not first opened out and examined. And basically, yeah, he had all these rules just"
00:14:12,00:14:19,"so that they couldn't cheat because really, it was a very secretive thing and lots of kings and"
00:14:19,00:14:25,queens around Europe were trying to influence it and stuff. And also people from the outside wanted
00:14:25,00:14:29,to know what was happening because he would gamble on it and stuff like that. So yeah. Is the idea that
00:14:29,00:14:35,"let's say the king of Spain wants the Spanish cardinal to get the gig as pope, he'll put something"
00:14:35,00:14:41,"in the pie saying, I'll give you 10,000 Florence if you vote for Cardinal Juan or whatever it is,"
00:14:41,00:14:46,"isn't it? That's the idea. Yeah. Oh, that's a fear, I guess. And I did read that these rules were"
00:14:46,00:14:52,"basically completely ineffective. And even though they existed, secret messages just always got in"
00:14:52,00:14:59,"and out in those days. There was a 16th century conclavist, so a conclavist was one of two assistants"
00:14:59,00:15:03,"that each cardinal was allowed to help them inside get dressed and clean their teeth and, you know,"
00:15:03,00:15:08,"they needed servants. Anyway. Well, yeah, you can't do a conclave if you're sexually frustrated,"
00:15:08,00:15:16,so something has to happen before you start. I won't hear such slander about the Catholic Church.
00:15:16,00:15:24,A conclave who wrote that Charles V pretty much knows when they urinate in this conclave.
00:15:24,00:15:29,That's the level of detail he's getting about the information. Wow. Interesting. And the point
00:15:29,00:15:33,"was, I suppose, this is a really, really, really powerful job. You have a huge amount of influence"
00:15:33,00:15:38,"over the course of Europe. Oh, yeah. So I guess you do want to try and novel it. Yeah. I didn't"
00:15:38,00:15:43,"know what conclave meant. It means with a key. Oh, yeah. Because you're locked up with a key."
00:15:43,00:15:47,Yeah. That's basically it. Conclave here. Yeah. It's funny you didn't know what it meant because
00:15:47,00:15:52,we've mentioned it on the podcast before. I don't listen to this show. This one you're talking
00:15:52,00:15:57,"about, James, this was the 1549 one, wasn't it? Correct, yeah. Which lasted two months,"
00:15:57,00:16:02,"which was actually pretty zippy for your average medieval conclave because there was a really,"
00:16:02,00:16:05,"really, really long one, which we may have mentioned before, which took 33 months,"
00:16:05,00:16:09,"which is Gregory the 10th. Yeah. And that was a bit embarrassing for all concerned,"
00:16:09,00:16:14,"and he changed the rules. Well, that's why they're locked away now. Because in that one where it"
00:16:14,00:16:20,"was three, however, three years or whatever it was, they kind of met and then they would go home"
00:16:20,00:16:23,and just mess around and then they would go and play golf or whatever. And then they would come
00:16:23,00:16:28,"back and they say, have we decided yet? And then they were like, no, no. And so from then on, yeah,"
00:16:28,00:16:33,"Gregory came up with a rule saying, okay, well, we're going to make a new rule. You have to all"
00:16:33,00:16:37,"go into the house and you can't leave the house until we have a decision. It's big brother,"
00:16:37,00:16:41,"basically. And then if you don't have a decision after three days, he gets cut down to one meal"
00:16:41,00:16:46,"a day. And then if you don't have anything after eight days, you just get bread and water plus wine."
00:16:46,00:16:50,"So you've got to have wine. That is like a brother, isn't it? They used to just like give them"
00:16:50,00:16:55,"very, very meager rations. Did the people in Big Brother over accidentally select a new post though?"
00:16:56,00:17:00,"No, John Tickle has been the pope for the last eight years. Cardinal Tickle."
00:17:00,00:17:08,"But the super long one that went on for over three years or whatever, they eventually after"
00:17:08,00:17:12,"reducing their rations and everything, eventually they took the roof off with the argument being"
00:17:12,00:17:16,that it must be that the Holy Ghost can't get its message to us through this roof. So we better
00:17:16,00:17:21,take the roof off to improve access. But I think the idea was maybe that that might make it even
00:17:21,00:17:25,"less comfortable if you've got. Yeah, whether exposed to the elements or that. I think it's"
00:17:25,00:17:29,all reasonable. They're just trying to hustle it up. You know why it's just the cardinals that vote?
00:17:29,00:17:33,"When you're voting for the pope, it's all the cardinals going to this room and they have to"
00:17:33,00:17:38,"come up with the idea. But it used to be that everyone in Rome could vote. Really? Yeah, until 1059."
00:17:38,00:17:43,"Did they keep voting in like, voting in the boat face or stupid people?"
00:17:43,00:17:51,You know why it is a bit like that. Popey book pope. Yes. So this was Benedict the 10th. The previous
00:17:51,00:17:56,pope had made the Roman people swear an oath that they wouldn't elect a new pope until his
00:17:56,00:18:02,"favored person had returned from a trip to Germany. So he was dying. He was like, I want this guy to"
00:18:02,00:18:08,"be pope. Don't vote for anyone else before he gets back. Anyway, this Benedict the 10th,"
00:18:08,00:18:14,his family had loads of money and so they bribed everyone to vote for them. So they voted for him.
00:18:14,00:18:19,"And in the meantime, this guy's mate, who was Nicholas the second, he's in Germany. He's going,"
00:18:19,00:18:24,what the hell's going on? I'm supposed to be pope. And he's with a load of other cardinals
00:18:24,00:18:27,"and they go, well, we're going to make you pope anyway. So then we have two popes. Then Nicholas"
00:18:27,00:18:32,"the second comes back to Rome, declares war on Benedict the 10th. They have a big old fight,"
00:18:32,00:18:36,"loads of people die, and then Nicholas eventually wins, sends Benedict to jail and said, okay,"
00:18:36,00:18:42,"from now on, only the cardinals vote because we can't trust the people. Because the cardinals"
00:18:42,00:18:46,"won't be bribed, but the people might be. That's very surprisingly democratic to say everyone in"
00:18:46,00:18:51,"Rome gets to stick their aura in about you as to be pope. Yeah, but I mean, really the pope was"
00:18:51,00:18:56,"effectively, you know, the leader of Rome, like Bishop of Rome. Yeah, even though he was a religious"
00:18:56,00:19:00,"thing, he was the guy who was in charge. Although no one else is getting voted democratically,"
00:19:00,00:19:05,"were they? That's true. You know, ahead of their time, the Catholics, I've always said it."
00:19:05,00:19:12,"If someone is a likely candidate for the papacy, they're known as papabile,"
00:19:12,00:19:18,which literally means popable. You're pretty papabile. Not to be confused with the pokemobile.
00:19:18,00:19:28,"It should not be pope. So a lot of this is in the recent, there's a movie recently"
00:19:28,00:19:34,"out called conclave. Amazing movie. It's so good. It's so good. It was written by Robert Harris,"
00:19:34,00:19:37,"wasn't it? The book is written by Robert Harris, which and it has a lot of good research in it."
00:19:37,00:19:41,"Yeah, yeah, he really did. He like he visited a lot. He spent a lot of time talking to people"
00:19:41,00:19:48,"in the know. So I did find I was looking at the kind of trivia of, you know, about the movie."
00:19:48,00:19:52,"And firstly, I found a Benedictine website, which had a Catholic Film Club podcast,"
00:19:52,00:19:57,their episode about conclave was titled conclave clueless evil or both.
00:19:57,00:20:02,"So they did not like it as much. Anyway, look, here's this fact I found from the,"
00:20:02,00:20:05,"this is all from, I think, from the IMDB. It's just about when someone becomes pope,"
00:20:05,00:20:10,"how they change. It was reported when Francis became pope to the current guy,"
00:20:10,00:20:15,"that on his elevation to pope, he contacted his Buenos Aires news agent personally to let him"
00:20:15,00:20:20,know he wouldn't be continuing his custom of returning the rubber bands from his daily newspaper
00:20:20,00:20:29,at the end of each month. Power really changes people. No spoilers for conclave. But can I
00:20:29,00:20:37,"talk about Pope Joan? So Pope Joan, people might know this is a theory that we had a female pope"
00:20:37,00:20:41,in the Middle Ages. And I think most people think it's definitely not true.
00:20:41,00:20:45,Right. But there are some people who think it is true and some relatively serious people who
00:20:45,00:20:53,"think it is true. There are definitely in museums in Italy, chairs that were used by the pope,"
00:20:53,00:20:59,"which have holes in the bottom of them. 100%. So in theory, you could check the anal genital"
00:20:59,00:21:05,"region of the pope. This is a giant pouch wrapping the coat. Damn, I should have sealed it up."
00:21:05,00:21:11,"And we did have rap singer. So who knows, would anyone properly check?"
00:21:11,00:21:17,"Kind of a rap singer. Brilliant. Brilliant. So yeah, the idea being that people say you"
00:21:17,00:21:22,use these chairs to check the genitals of the pope to make sure that they're...
00:21:22,00:21:24,"And it's when they become pope. It's not for daily use. It's sort of,"
00:21:24,00:21:28,"you get named pope and then they check, which is pretty stupid because you would think you would"
00:21:28,00:21:32,"pop them in the chair first. But whether or not that's true, the chairs definitely do exist."
00:21:32,00:21:37,Some people think they might have been to check that the new pope hadn't been castrated.
00:21:37,00:21:42,Right. Some people think that they were originally Roman imperial birthing stools.
00:21:42,00:21:49,Okay. And the idea is that the papacy was trying to show that they were imperial and important.
00:21:49,00:21:53,And so they use this very old Roman birthing stool as a throne.
00:21:53,00:21:57,Could the hell get a different old Roman stool? Couldn't they have gone to the museum
00:21:57,00:22:01,and been like anything except the one that women gave birth through?
00:22:01,00:22:03,Yeah. Or it could have been a b-day.
00:22:03,00:22:08,"Yeah. But yeah, we basically don't know why they have these chairs."
00:22:08,00:22:14,"But there are, you know, there's the odd, probably not massively serious, but there are the odd"
00:22:14,00:22:18,"historian that thinks that this might be true. This guy called Michael E. Habicht,"
00:22:18,00:22:23,who's an archaeologist at Flinders University. And he found lots of coins from the era.
00:22:23,00:22:28,Of when Pope John was there and found that they had slightly different monograms.
00:22:28,00:22:32,"Or what, like a typo John for John? Maybe they had, maybe there were two different"
00:22:32,00:22:35,popes at that time. And why were there two different popes? Or maybe because they found
00:22:35,00:22:38,"that one of them was a woman and they had to, yeah, we don't know."
00:22:38,00:22:43,"They mint coins in between popes. In the Middle Ages, they would mint a coin,"
00:22:43,00:22:48,"which had the crossed staffs, but no pope because there was no pope."
00:22:48,00:22:50,"So if they minted a coin during that period, it had to be a special,"
00:22:50,00:22:54,"there's no pope when we're making this coin. And they still do it these days, but with a euro."
00:22:54,00:22:56,"Well, the between papers these period used to be quite interesting,"
00:22:56,00:23:00,"because it went a bit lawless apparently, because the pope was essentially the legal"
00:23:00,00:23:06,"authority in Rome. Once all the popes disappeared for their conclave, Rome went quite mad. There"
00:23:06,00:23:12,"was one time where, they should bring that back. Yeah, that's great. Whenever the pope dies,"
00:23:12,00:23:16,everyone just goes full on perch. Just losing. Or crime is legal.
00:23:16,00:23:22,"Well, in fact, they basically did it. This was, I think it was in the 14th or 15th century,"
00:23:22,00:23:26,"where as soon as the cardinals disappeared to decide the new pope, the local authorities"
00:23:26,00:23:30,hired a wizard to come and take control of the city to purge it of plague.
00:23:30,00:23:35,"Sorry, I know Dan's not here, but if you've got his notes, I thought we have to have a nod to the"
00:23:35,00:23:41,"poor guy. And yeah, this guy, Demetrios, used to lead this wild bull through the streets calling"
00:23:41,00:23:46,out for the plague to be dispersed. So good. Do you not think he maybe misunderstood what
00:23:46,00:23:51,a papal bull was? Superb. Superb. Very esoteric joke.
00:23:51,00:23:57,How many papal bull puns are going around these days? Can I talk very briefly about this guy?
00:23:57,00:24:04,"Scappi. Bartolomeo Scappi. The chef. The chef, the papal chef. He was an amazing guy. He was"
00:24:04,00:24:10,"one of the first ever international celebrity chefs. He was the cuoco segreto to the popes,"
00:24:10,00:24:15,"the secret cook, which probably means the personal private cook to the popes. While"
00:24:16,00:24:20,Michelangelo was next door doing up the Sistine Chapel. So it was a time of great lavish stuff.
00:24:20,00:24:28,"And he had amazing recipes. He made incredibly elaborate things. So, you know, he would make,"
00:24:28,00:24:36,he would serve 60 course meals. Too much. It's more of a tasting menu. Is it one where you
00:24:36,00:24:41,still leave hungry? You actually have to have McDonald's before you go. There's a chippy just
00:24:41,00:24:47,"outside the Chappy restaurant. But he was an amazing guy, clearly. And he arrived after"
00:24:47,00:24:52,"Leo the 10th, who was one of the most lavish popes ever. Leo the 10th was made pope on his first"
00:24:52,00:24:55,"day through a massive fireworks party and feast, then disappeared for the night with his lover,"
00:24:55,00:25:02,who he then made the Cardinal of Sienna. Those were the days of being a pope. But Chappy got stuck
00:25:02,00:25:08,"in this thing. He got caught up in a wave of puritanical reform. So when Pius the fifth came in,"
00:25:09,00:25:13,"he was planning this huge, great party, Chappy. And it would have been an amazing banquet. He"
00:25:13,00:25:20,wanted to do miniature food castles with live birds in them. Incredible. A jelly pope effigy.
00:25:20,00:25:25,"Jelly pope. Fantastic. And then he got told, oh yeah, Pius the fifth is actually planning a big"
00:25:25,00:25:32,wave of reform. And he just wants a boiled egg for his supper from now on. I know. So then he wrote
00:25:32,00:25:38,"this book, Chappy, the opera dell'arte del cuginare, 1570, contains the first ever picture of a fork,"
00:25:38,00:25:43,some of the first ever recipes for stuffed pasta. Like if you were hoping for an opera from the
00:25:43,00:25:48,"book, that's what's confusing. It is called the opera. No, but he just did after a 60 cost meal,"
00:25:48,00:26:02,"the fat lady. She was thin at the start. Okay, it's time for fact number three and that's Andy."
00:26:02,00:26:08,My fact is there is only one grade one listed dog kennel in the UK.
00:26:08,00:26:14,"Really? Yeah, yeah. And I visited it the other day. No, I did. I visit it's this place in Kent"
00:26:14,00:26:19,called item moat. And it's like it's a beautiful medieval manor house and it's got a moat all
00:26:19,00:26:22,"the way around it. And it dates back to the 14th century. National trust, it's bloody good. The"
00:26:22,00:26:27,trees for the oldest bits of item moat date back to the 1320s. So it's really old this place.
00:26:27,00:26:35,And it had this kennel built attached to it in the 1890s when they were doing a bit of work on the
00:26:35,00:26:39,"house. And because the kennel is attached to a grade one listed property, which we should say is"
00:26:39,00:26:44,the highest possible grade of listing in the UK. So you're not allowed to do anything to it. It's
00:26:44,00:26:48,"protected. You're not allowed to do anything. If something's grade two listed, you can maybe move"
00:26:48,00:26:53,"the furniture around, maybe do a bit of interior decorating grade one listed, just leave it alone."
00:26:53,00:26:58,Like it's really historical that stuff. And so this kennel is now grade one listed. It's a nice
00:26:58,00:27:03,"kennel. It's really massive. It was made for a St. Bernard dog. It's quite plain. It's wooden, but"
00:27:03,00:27:09,"it's nice. You know, it's got the classic roof shape, the eaves. Does it look like just a classic"
00:27:09,00:27:14,"what a child would draw? It's a classic kennel, I would say. Yeah, yeah. It's really good. Yeah."
00:27:14,00:27:18,"This is very cool. Just to say on the place, it's absolutely fantastic. It's got a"
00:27:18,00:27:24,billions room because I bought the guide because I'm deep into my national trust years now.
00:27:24,00:27:29,"Are you a member? Oh yeah. Of course you are. You do it for the parking there, don't you?"
00:27:32,00:27:36,I just like this. This was a detail in the guide. It has a billions room with a door
00:27:36,00:27:40,"which opens directly onto the moat, which is quite cool. What? You walk up the door, you"
00:27:40,00:27:45,"find the moat. That's what it sounds like. Well, you go in the house over the bridge,"
00:27:45,00:27:47,"and then you go into the billions room, and then there's a door at the other end of the"
00:27:47,00:27:50,"billions room, and you open it, you're in the moat. But why? Because then you fall into the"
00:27:50,00:27:56,"moat. Yes. Okay, so why does that exist? Well, I'm coming to that. I didn't feel like you were to"
00:27:56,00:28:00,be honest. I'm just looking at us like our questions are unreasonable. You might use it
00:28:00,00:28:03,"if you wanted to go for a swim in the moat, or if you needed to get into the moat, but there was"
00:28:03,00:28:09,"an unfortunate secondary use, which is if the loo is too far away, and you want to just,"
00:28:09,00:28:13,"you know, relieve yourself in the billions room without going all the way to the loo,"
00:28:13,00:28:18,you pee into the moat. Pop your bum out. All right. And probably your front.
00:28:18,00:28:23,"Okay, you're doing it. It's for a number one. Only man would be allowed to do this, probably."
00:28:27,00:28:33,They're pausing their billions game to have a shit in the moat. I think that's a bit uncouth.
00:28:33,00:28:39,"Well, that's how we draw the line, is it? I see. Well, if it flows past the window"
00:28:39,00:28:44,"where the ladies are having their drinks. I don't know, Andy, I'm not sure."
00:28:44,00:28:47,"No, I like it. I'm going one installed in my house. I'm just reading what's in the guide."
00:28:47,00:28:54,"They did use to be quite elaborate dog kennels. It's funny how much we valued dogs historically,"
00:28:54,00:28:58,"at least in Britain. And it's basically because of hunting, so because they were so valuable."
00:28:58,00:29:03,"And so from medieval times to the 19th century, big manna houses had a bunch of hounds and they"
00:29:03,00:29:10,"bloody loved them. I was reading a hunting manual, which had chapter after chapter on how to build"
00:29:10,00:29:15,"a kennel and what the right kennel should be. And it said, you know, the benches within the"
00:29:15,00:29:20,kennel around the edges need to be the perfect height for the dogs to rest on. So they want to
00:29:20,00:29:24,"rest above ground level, but not so high that it'll be tiring for them to jump up onto after a long"
00:29:24,00:29:31,"day's hunting. Okay. So five foot wide, two point five foot high. They need at least one fireplace"
00:29:31,00:29:37,to curl up in front of with a chimney or maybe two chimneys. They also need a little dog to do a
00:29:37,00:29:44,shit out of it. Famous painting of the dogs or playing cards. What you don't see is the little
00:29:44,00:29:50,"doorway. Yeah, yeah, they need several yards, one paved and one grass so that they can have a bunch"
00:29:50,00:29:56,"of different, you know, surfaces to play on as much sunlight as possible in the yards, but also"
00:29:56,00:30:02,"shade options. And yeah, and they need to be cleaned every day. They really love, it wasn't just that"
00:30:02,00:30:06,hounds were there as a utility thing. They were really attached to them. And they needed a person
00:30:06,00:30:12,in the kennels living with them at all times. Come on. Who's going to feed the fire otherwise?
00:30:12,00:30:19,"Exactly. That's not much of a job, is it? The dog boy? I feel not. I think you probably,"
00:30:19,00:30:25,maybe you got to climb the ranks to be top dog. You were Lord of the Manor at the end.
00:30:25,00:30:30,"But apparently, yeah, he, the dog boy or some other child must be constantly in the kennel"
00:30:30,00:30:34,"to be preventing fights between the dogs even at night. Oh gosh, that is a rough gig."
00:30:34,00:30:41,"Rough. Because if you're just putting another log on the fire and you know,"
00:30:41,00:30:44,"putting the dogs to bed, talking about reading their story, that's fine. But if the fight's"
00:30:44,00:30:48,going to break out at night. I feel like it would. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how you break up a fight
00:30:48,00:30:52,"between a bunch of dogs in the kennel. I believe you're a boy. I think you're up the bum, don't you?"
00:30:52,00:30:56,"I think that is. Is that what you do? Well, that is a definite, if a dog's clamped its"
00:30:56,00:31:02,"jaws around your leg, that is the thing to do. Finger up the bum. Or ask a nearby friend to"
00:31:02,00:31:07,do the same. So maybe you have two dog boys in there. Yeah. Do you know what the most expensive
00:31:07,00:31:14,kennel of all time was? Oh no. Is it gasable? No. Is it has a hole in the roof? That's a clue.
00:31:14,00:31:18,"Oh, do we know this? Can we work out why it has a hole in the roof? It might be a chimney."
00:31:18,00:31:24,That hole is what makes it very expensive. Oh. And this is a kennel. Yes. Small hole. It was
00:31:24,00:31:34,"sold for $44,100 in 2019. Sorry, in 2020. Oh, it's a historic kennel. It's the kennel that,"
00:31:34,00:31:40,"no, hang on. Let me get to the end of the wrong answer. The kennel that Scott of the Antarctic"
00:31:40,00:31:44,took with him for the sled dogs. I see. And it's got a small hole in the roof because
00:31:44,00:31:48,you'd burn a fire in there to keep the dog's wall. Very good. No. Yep. Good. Thank you.
00:31:48,00:31:53,What might make a hole in a roof? A bird falling. Might not make a hole. It probably
00:31:53,00:32:01,bounce off his tin roof. Okay. Meteorite. You are meteorite. That is correct. Wow. This was
00:32:01,00:32:08,the only known dog kennel to have been hit by a meteorite. And it was sold by Christie's in 2020.
00:32:08,00:32:16,"Sorry. Who the hell paid $44,000 for that? That's insane. Someone insane. Is it Dan Schreiber? Did"
00:32:16,00:32:21,"it say who'd bought it? It was Dan Schreiber. What happened to the dog? Oh, the dog was fine."
00:32:21,00:32:26,Yeah. He doesn't have a house anymore because they sold it. Right. But he wasn't hurt by the
00:32:26,00:32:30,"meteorite. So that's good. Well, that's good. People go nuts for meteorites though. Did it come"
00:32:30,00:32:36,with the meteorite? I believe not. Okay. That is some salesmanship that has happened there.
00:32:36,00:32:42,"One careful owner. There were a series of luxury dog kennels recently. One of them,"
00:32:42,00:32:47,"when it was sold, came with the warning that the dog was not included, which I quite like."
00:32:47,00:32:52,"This was, did you read back in 2018, a bunch of architects, world famous architects were"
00:32:52,00:32:57,invited to design these dog kennels. So like Zahar Hadid's company did one and all the world
00:32:57,00:33:02,"famous. You've buried the lead here. Lead, dog joint, good. Berry, dog's berry, fine. There's"
00:33:02,00:33:08,"a dog event annually called Good Wolf, like Good Wood. And the event they have is called"
00:33:08,00:33:13,"Barchitecture. And it's, they get famous architects to design kennels for dogs."
00:33:13,00:33:17,"Oh, it's been happening every year now. Okay. And it's to raise money for Blue Cross."
00:33:17,00:33:20,"Yes. I think it is in fact. They do look cool. I mean, some of them look amazing. You know,"
00:33:20,00:33:24,"there's a, there's one called Bonehenge, which is very good. Nice. Is it all puns?"
00:33:24,00:33:29,"Most, I mean, it doesn't hurt. I think there's a noise canceling kennel for use on fireworks"
00:33:29,00:33:34,"night. Oh, that's a good idea. Very good idea. That's actually a little bit like Arizona in 2018."
00:33:34,00:33:41,There was a dog kennels. It was the Maricopa County Animal Care Company. And they had this
00:33:41,00:33:45,"program called Calming Companions, where they invited people to come and sit in their kennels"
00:33:45,00:33:50,with the dogs on the 4th of July. So that they could calm them down as the fireworks went off.
00:33:50,00:33:55,200 people rocked up. How do you calm a dog down when fireworks come off? Massage has evolved.
00:33:55,00:34:01,"Honey, they read, they've read them stories as you suggested earlier. So you, there you go."
00:34:01,00:34:05,"Oh, that's nice. Played the music, entertained the dogs, and then we're all ripped to shreds."
00:34:05,00:34:12,"Do you know Princess Alexandra of Denmark, who was married to Edward the 7th?"
00:34:12,00:34:18,"Yes. Yeah, of course. She was, she loved dogs. Love dogs. And she kept loads and loads of them"
00:34:18,00:34:23,"at Sandringham. And there was a journalist called Sarah Tully, who was shown them and wrote about"
00:34:23,00:34:29,them. And they just seem amazing. Each kennel had a bedroom with an iron bedstead. Leading from
00:34:29,00:34:33,the bedroom is a sitting room supplied with straw and a constant supply of fresh water.
00:34:33,00:34:39,"If there's a sitting room, is there also a staying room, a rollovering room, a shake hands room?"
00:34:39,00:34:45,"There is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which I believe is in America."
00:34:46,00:34:53,"It's in New York. Yeah, they've got Mary Antoinette's dog kennel, which is very nice. It's more of a"
00:34:53,00:35:01,"little... Why didn't she sleep in a bed? She was very humble. Yeah, famously. So, and it's more"
00:35:01,00:35:06,"of a carrying, you know, a plush carrying case kind of, because it's for a little dog, because I"
00:35:06,00:35:11,"imagine she had a small dog. And it's, it was made by a master furniture maker. So it's got"
00:35:11,00:35:17,"neoclassical acanthus leaves carved around the edges and it's, obviously it's gilded. The dog,"
00:35:17,00:35:21,"amazingly, was imprisoned alongside Mary Antoinette. Supposedly. Oh, no, he didn't get his head chops"
00:35:21,00:35:28,after that. I don't think they had a smaller guillotine. I don't think so. There's something
00:35:28,00:35:33,"that's quite cute about that, though. No. I mean, it sounds cute, but then I think at the end it"
00:35:33,00:35:37,"becomes less and less cute. You're right. And there's a moment where it switches, isn't there?"
00:35:39,00:35:44,"There is a kennel in West Sussex near East Grinstead, which is a very interesting and weird"
00:35:44,00:35:50,"place, which was built by Edwin Lutjens, who's one of the most famous architects that England is"
00:35:50,00:35:56,"ever pretty. It was a huge deal. And it was built as a dog kennel, but it is currently, right now,"
00:35:56,00:36:01,"as we recall this, it's on sale as a four-bedroom house. And it's one of these big kennels for a"
00:36:01,00:36:06,pack of dogs that Anna was talking about. And I've looked at the photos and it is nice.
00:36:06,00:36:11,"I think it's more than a million quid. It's on sale for like, it's really..."
00:36:11,00:36:15,And dogs could afford that back in the day. Yeah. House prices were just a completely
00:36:15,00:36:18,different ball game back in the day. A ball game. There's another one.
00:36:18,00:36:27,"That's amazing. It's stunning. If you Google it, it's like, it's a beautiful home now. And it's"
00:36:27,00:36:31,"four bedrooms. It's all on one floor, obviously, because it was built for the kennels. We could"
00:36:31,00:36:35,"four bedrooms. We could do it. I mean, I'd love to live in that. No, that's not where we're retiring,"
00:36:35,00:36:42,guys. We'll get a dog boy to come and look after us. Put his finger up on his thumb every time we
00:36:42,00:36:55,"get angry. Okay, it is time for fact number four. And that is Dan Schreiber's facts. Dan, what's your"
00:36:55,00:37:02,fact today? My fact this week is that reenactment actors on America's Most Wanted run a higher
00:37:02,00:37:07,risk of being arrested after the show goes out than normal actors. Tell us more.
00:37:07,00:37:13,"No, he can't tell us more. He can't because he's indisposed. But James, you can tell us more."
00:37:13,00:37:21,I can because he gave us a link and it is from the San Diego reader and it was a letter. Someone
00:37:21,00:37:26,"said, ""Hey, Matt."" They've written to someone called Matthew Alice, who was a journalist here and said,"
00:37:26,00:37:31,"""Are there any examples when actors in these crime-solving reality shows were spotted in the"
00:37:31,00:37:38,"street and turned in thinking they were the actual perps?"" And this was a letter from Langston in"
00:37:38,00:37:43,"Spring Valley and this journalist called Matt replied and said, ""Yeah, that is definitely the case."""
00:37:43,00:37:49,And there was one woman who played an evil nanny housekeeper who was forging employers checks and
00:37:49,00:37:55,burned down their houses and the actor who played them was recognized by two teenagers and she was
00:37:55,00:38:01,hustled to the prison and they had to be straightened out afterwards using her social security
00:38:01,00:38:08,number to prove that she was an actor. Because it's a good lie if you are an evil nanny who's
00:38:08,00:38:13,"been burning down people's houses and faking checks if you're arrested in the street. You say,"
00:38:13,00:38:17,"""No, no, no, I'm one of the actors in the show."" They use that image of me because for right reasons"
00:38:17,00:38:21,they couldn't use the image of the real criminal. It's probably worth everyone joining Equity just
00:38:21,00:38:26,"in case. I don't know if it's the most foolproof plan. But they do choose people who look similar,"
00:38:26,00:38:32,"don't they? They do, for sure. I haven't seen America's Most Wanted ever. I saw Crime Watch"
00:38:32,00:38:36,"a bit when it was on. Yeah, which is our British equivalent, by the way, but it's quite a different"
00:38:36,00:38:40,"tone. America's Most Wanted, I watched a little bit of it and it's that American tone that's quite"
00:38:40,00:38:44,over the top and sensationalised and quite hard to watch. I should just explain very quickly that
00:38:44,00:38:49,"these shows, so Crime Watch and America's Most Wanted, basically there's a crime that's happened"
00:38:49,00:38:54,in the past and they do a recreation of that crime and then they have a phone number that you can
00:38:54,00:38:59,call in case you have any details of what might have happened and then they'll give you a reward
00:38:59,00:39:02,"if they managed to catch the person who did it. Yeah. Yeah. And it has happened in the UK,"
00:39:02,00:39:09,like in Crime Watch there was a guy called Steve Watson who was in the reconstruction of a murder
00:39:09,00:39:15,"of a woman and it was shown on BBC One. This woman's called Julie Pacey and sure enough,"
00:39:15,00:39:20,people recognised him in the reconstruction and the police came and they brought him in and they
00:39:20,00:39:26,"did his fingerprints and DNA and stuff like that. Wait, the actor? The actor, yeah. So this is"
00:39:26,00:39:31,"incorrect? Yeah, it's the same as what happened in America. But luckily, in this case, they had the"
00:39:31,00:39:37,"DNA of the perpetrator of the murder, so they could tell that it wasn't him. I'm amazed that it"
00:39:37,00:39:41,"actually works, America's Most Wanted. I couldn't believe it, yeah. Because they've brought in a"
00:39:41,00:39:44,"lot of people over the years, like they were on for years and years and years and years and they"
00:39:44,00:39:48,would have a huge phone bank of people taking tips from members of the public after the show.
00:39:48,00:39:53,"There was one, I don't know if you guys found Mark Goodman in 1988. Did you find this guy? No,"
00:39:53,00:40:00,"someone else found him. Superb. So he had committed a burglary, right? And he was in prison for it."
00:40:00,00:40:06,Okay. But he was wanted in a different bit of the country because he had been convicted for an
00:40:06,00:40:12,"armed robbery and then he'd escaped. So he was on the lamb for that crime, but he was in prison"
00:40:12,00:40:17,already for another one. He and his fellow lags were watching America's Most Wanted one night
00:40:17,00:40:22,and his face came up on the screen. Wow. And he quickly tried to change the channel.
00:40:22,00:40:29,"But it was too late. It's too suspicious. Play it cool. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Do you think, like,"
00:40:29,00:40:36,"if you're a criminal, like, I don't really like watching panel shows on TV because it's my job"
00:40:36,00:40:39,"and it's like, I know they're really good, but I just feel like, oh, that's my job. I don't want to"
00:40:39,00:40:42,"do it when I'm off as well. I couldn't agree more. I would have thought if I was banged up,"
00:40:42,00:40:48,"I wouldn't want to watch Crime Watch. No. Well, they did. And amazingly, what do you think the"
00:40:48,00:40:52,"other prisoners did? They said, oh, well, we're all in it together. So let's definitely not dub"
00:40:52,00:40:56,you into the authorities. They stopped him into the authorities. I cannot believe the correct
00:40:56,00:41:00,"response is to give him a false mustache and say, oh, yeah, funny about your brother, you know."
00:41:00,00:41:06,"That's prison morality for you, isn't it? I'm just really shocked. It's a doggy dog world."
00:41:06,00:41:12,"Yeah. America's Most Wanted Alone has helped to catch over 1,200 fugitives and bring home"
00:41:12,00:41:17,"loads of loads of missing children. Crime Watch has helped police with over 5,000 cases. So it is"
00:41:17,00:41:23,quite impressive. I think my favorite from America's Most Wanted Catches was this
00:41:23,00:41:29,"story set in the Green Parrot Cafe in Salt Lake City, Utah, which is incredible. Did you guys"
00:41:29,00:41:34,"read about this? Hello. So basically, there was a robbery of that cafe in 1992, and it was a bit"
00:41:34,00:41:38,"botched and someone ended up dead, like one of the staff, I think, in the cafe or one of the"
00:41:38,00:41:44,"people in the cafe. And so a few months later, America's Most Wanted aired that and said,"
00:41:44,00:41:49,"have you seen this killer? And all the staff at the cafe were like, oh, we're going to be on"
00:41:49,00:41:53,America's Most Wanted member because there was that murder in here a couple of months ago. Let's
00:41:53,00:41:57,watch. So all the staff and all the patrons in there crowded around to watch and they watched the
00:41:57,00:42:02,"story and they watched, you know, have you seen this guy? And then there was another story after"
00:42:02,00:42:07,"it that said, okay, on to the next one case of a child molester. Have you seen this man?"
00:42:07,00:42:12,"And they kept the TV running and all the patrons and all the staff watching it went,"
00:42:12,00:42:15,"God, he looks a lot like, he looks so much like the guy who works in our kitchen,"
00:42:15,00:42:18,"doesn't he? And then he said, gradually the manager was like, they were like,"
00:42:18,00:42:25,"hang on, it is Tommy from the kitchen. And they, it was Kenneth, Kenneth from the kitchen."
00:42:26,00:42:32,And so they called up crime watch. Gave him a false mustache. He just watches that plate so well.
00:42:32,00:42:39,Sent him on his way. Wow. Isn't that a coincidence? That's insane. Yeah. It's a dangerous cafe to
00:42:39,00:42:46,be going to. Yeah. All these shows are based off a German format called Akten Zeichen XY.
00:42:46,00:42:53,"That means file reference XY unsolved. Ungerlust. Yeah. And this year, in fact, that TV show"
00:42:53,00:42:59,managed to catch a member of the Baader-Meinhof gang. And if you haven't heard of the Baader-Meinhof
00:42:59,00:43:04,"gang, you soon will, because that's what they're most famous for. As soon as you hear of them once,"
00:43:04,00:43:07,you always hear about them again sometime in the next couple of weeks.
00:43:07,00:43:11,"The Baader-Meinhof effect. Is that what it's called? Yeah. They were basically a group of,"
00:43:11,00:43:16,they were like a Marxist terror group who were attacking people and robbing people because of
00:43:16,00:43:21,"the guilt of World War II or something like that. 70s? 70s and early 80s, yeah."
00:43:21,00:43:25,"And sorry, is this show still going out in Germany? Yeah, yeah. And they just caught them."
00:43:25,00:43:29,"They caught them this year. They said, oh, like, this is a thing that happened and they found this"
00:43:29,00:43:35,"woman who was called Daniella Kletter, who was apprehended thanks to that. And she'd done violent"
00:43:35,00:43:39,acts during the 70s. And was it a bit of a 'forgiven-forget' kind of thing 50 years ago?
00:43:39,00:43:43,"Oh, you're so 'forgiven-forget'. I think generally speaking, they're not thought very highly of,"
00:43:43,00:43:49,"the Baader-Meinhof group. No. Anna, there's a reason your Nazi hunting career stumbled on the blocks"
00:43:49,00:43:53,which is your milk of human kindness is so flowing. I just think it was so nice when you
00:43:53,00:43:59,actually meet them. Do you know who voiced all of America's Most Wanted? Who's that?
00:43:59,00:44:04,"It's a man who, I think we've very, very briefly mentioned, but about eight years ago,"
00:44:04,00:44:09,"he's a man nicknamed Old Thunderthroat, Don Lafontaine. He died about 10 years ago, 10,"
00:44:09,00:44:14,15 years ago. And he is the man who's behind every Hollywood trailer you've ever seen.
00:44:14,00:44:19,Is it that guy? In a world. And he did the voices on America's Most Wanted.
00:44:19,00:44:25,He didn't do the voices. He did the voiceover. Sorry.
00:44:25,00:44:30,"Can you hear this one sound like Mickey Mouse? Oh, sure, I can! What?"
00:44:30,00:44:39,But I just got distracted reading about him. He would do up to 35 jobs a day around Hollywood
00:44:39,00:44:43,"voiceover. He was so in demand at the height of his career, just even in a world, you know, of"
00:44:43,00:44:48,crime. Just amazing voice. But Screen Actors Guild said he was the
00:44:48,00:44:53,"busiest ever member of their guild. Is that so? That's really good, because he doesn't have to go"
00:44:53,00:44:57,"somewhere for three months on location. And, you know, like, a job's a job and it takes him a"
00:44:57,00:45:06,"short time. He also invented the phrases ""one man army"", ""one man, one destiny"", and ""from the bedroom"
00:45:06,00:45:11,"to the boardroom"", and ""nowhere to run, nowhere to hide"". Like, he invented all those phrases."
00:45:11,00:45:15,"So, ""nowhere to run, nowhere to hide"" is something I say quite a lot. I very seldom..."
00:45:15,00:45:17,"They might not be things he regularly says, but you do recognize them, though."
00:45:17,00:45:20,"Like, ""from the bedroom to the boardroom, I don't recognize""."
00:45:20,00:45:25,What does that mean? Is that you're shagging someone and then you hire them?
00:45:25,00:45:29,"Yeah. Or is it... I mean, you wake up in a bedroom, don't you? Mostly."
00:45:29,00:45:31,I don't know. What? It's just your morning routine.
00:45:31,00:45:34,"Yeah, I get up in the bedroom. I typically wake in the bedroom when I go to the boardroom."
00:45:34,00:45:37,I very seldom wake up in the boardroom and go to the bedroom.
00:45:37,00:45:39,It just doesn't feel like we need a saying for that.
00:45:40,00:45:43,"You're right. I like it, though. I do like it."
00:45:43,00:45:46,Because he often improvised these bits and wrote them himself.
00:45:46,00:45:48,"Also, he really made those up. It wasn't like they were given to him and he said them."
00:45:48,00:45:51,"Sometimes they would be, but sometimes he made them up himself."
00:45:51,00:45:55,Because he can't make up the plot of Terminator and just bust it once they've made the film.
00:45:55,00:45:57,"Like, they've made the film. They probably have an idea of what they wanted to say."
00:45:57,00:45:59,That's really cool that he invented those phrases.
00:45:59,00:46:03,Do you know who does the theme tune for Crime Watch in the UK?
00:46:03,00:46:07,No. This is a guy called John Cameron. He wrote it.
00:46:07,00:46:12,And he also arranged the album Mellow Yellow by Friends of the Podcast.
00:46:12,00:46:16,"Saffron band, Donovan. He's suddenly popping up a lot, isn't he?"
00:46:16,00:46:17,"He's a bloody bar of mine, hoping me."
00:46:17,00:46:25,The coolest thing I read about Crime Watch was they did a looking back over 40 years of it
00:46:25,00:46:29,thing and interviewed a bunch of the presenters and asked them about their favorite moments.
00:46:29,00:46:32,"And one of them, he was talking about how amazing the detectives are"
00:46:32,00:46:35,and how they spot these tiny things. And it's so Sherlock.
00:46:35,00:46:42,He said that the perpetrator's alibi was cracked because a detective noticed in a photo of the
00:46:42,00:46:48,crime scene there was a drip coming from the kitchen tap and the suspects had admitted that
00:46:48,00:46:53,he'd used the tap before leaving the house. But the police calculated how long it would have taken
00:46:53,00:46:58,"the kitchen sink to fill up with that dripping tap, dripping at that rate and realized it wouldn't"
00:46:58,00:47:03,have filled to the extent that it had if he'd been there at the time he'd said so he must have
00:47:03,00:47:07,done the murder. Isn't that cool? That's incredible. That's Sherlock Holmes.
00:47:07,00:47:09,"Yeah, it doesn't feel like it would stand up in car."
00:47:09,00:47:16,I've got a tap with trips and then every now and then you get like a little splurge.
00:47:16,00:47:20,"I know what you mean. It could have just stopped dripping for a while and then suddenly, yeah."
00:47:20,00:47:22,And it was just based on that. So it could be a wrong thing.
00:47:22,00:47:28,I was looking at the history of shows that tap in that basically allow the public to take part
00:47:28,00:47:36,in crime solving. And the first example I could find was a TV show broadcast on the BBC in 1938
00:47:36,00:47:42,called 'Telecrime' and it was actually a spin-off of a... 1938.
00:47:42,00:47:46,"Yeah. Well, the public couldn't... That's so early. That's like they had to stop for the war."
00:47:46,00:47:50,"They did not stop for the war. It was sort of that brief thing where there was TV in the UK,"
00:47:50,00:47:54,"but no one had a set. It was exactly then, yeah. Yeah. The war was it. And then they did stop for"
00:47:54,00:48:00,"the war. Was it an invasion of Belgium? I mean, that is a big crime. That is a big crime. Have"
00:48:00,00:48:06,"you seen this army? They have five million men. Oh, no. I think it's you, Fira. Quick, put up this"
00:48:06,00:48:16,"moustache. Oh, no! It was based on a magazine series called 'Photo Crime' this way. You'd be"
00:48:16,00:48:21,shown all these pictures of crime scenes and then they'd write clues next to them and then you could
00:48:21,00:48:25,"work out who did it. And the way the show worked was it was fictional, by the way, so it was like"
00:48:25,00:48:29,"a who done it. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it really invited you to work out who did it. So the"
00:48:29,00:48:34,idea of the show was they showed you enough evidence in the 15-minute show to work out who the killer
00:48:34,00:48:38,"was. And then just as the killer was about to be revealed, the screen suddenly phased a black"
00:48:38,00:48:44,"and a big question mark came up. Really? And a voiceover came up saying, ""Do you know who did it?"""
00:48:44,00:48:47,And then it paused on the screen for a couple of minutes while you could sit there at home on
00:48:47,00:48:51,"your sofa, noting down on the clues and working out. So there was a show only a couple of years ago"
00:48:51,00:48:56,"called Armchair Detectives with Susan Kalman in it, which did a similar thing. It was absolutely"
00:48:56,00:49:00,"brilliant. And they never recommissioned it, I think, because it was extremely expensive to make,"
00:49:00,00:49:07,because effectively you were making an entire murder mystery play each week. You're making us an
00:49:07,00:49:11,"inspector morse. Yeah, and you needed loads of cast, and the cast couldn't be the same every week,"
00:49:11,00:49:16,"because otherwise it would just not make any sense. And yeah, but it was a brilliant show."
00:49:16,00:49:19,"Oh, there you go, nicked it from a 1938 format, so cool. Yeah."
00:49:19,00:49:24,"I was looking at True Crime in general, because these shows, they have a big effect on people,"
00:49:24,00:49:27,"and people's perceptions of crime, you know, how much crime you think there is. If you watch"
00:49:27,00:49:30,"America's Most Wanted, you'll probably think there are more terrible crimes happening than"
00:49:30,00:49:35,"there are, obviously. And, you know, podcasting, I find this amazing, because it's been studied,"
00:49:35,00:49:41,"like, the effect of True Crime podcasting on people. So 35% of True Crime fans say they have"
00:49:41,00:49:48,"investigated people around them. No. Yeah, because you start thinking, I could do this work."
00:49:48,00:49:52,"Are they investigating their friends just to practice, or do they suddenly think"
00:49:52,00:49:55,"they're friends or murderers, do we think? Does it make you very suspicious, or does it just"
00:49:55,00:50:00,"make you think, I'm going to sharpen my wits? Probably, yeah, probably just you see people"
00:50:00,00:50:04,"acting like that on the show as an investigating, and probably it just helps you to have a go"
00:50:04,00:50:06,"yourself. It doesn't make me want to listen to True Crime, it's going to make me think all my"
00:50:06,00:50:10,"mates are murderers. But you're a woman, Anna, so you should like True Crime, as in many more women"
00:50:10,00:50:15,"like. Okay, then I will. Enjoy True Crime than men, and women only like one thing, that's crime."
00:50:15,00:50:23,"I went to watch my favorite murderer, Hammersmith, and the audience percentage of women was through"
00:50:23,00:50:28,"the roof. Really? Yeah, it was like being at a Guilty Feminist podcast. Right. There's many,"
00:50:28,00:50:34,"many, many more women than that. So we are all quite sick and twisted. There are loads of theories"
00:50:34,00:50:39,"as to why, like one theory is these stories contain kind of information about how to avoid crime. If,"
00:50:39,00:50:43,"as a woman, you know, women, I think. Yeah, right, that's why they're listening. Come on,"
00:50:43,00:50:49,it's just a lascivious desire to hear some gruesome murders. I don't know. Or women empathize more with
00:50:49,00:50:53,"women victims of crime. That might be a thing. Yeah, like it's, yeah, I think you can see a"
00:50:53,00:50:59,"lot of reasons. I must admit, when I, quite a few years ago now, I went back and read all of the"
00:50:59,00:51:04,"Sherlock Holmes short stories. And I must admit, I'd be sat on the tube sort of looking at people's"
00:51:04,00:51:08,shoes and seeing if I could work out where they've been that day and stuff. That's kind of the same
00:51:08,00:51:13,"thing. Yeah, completely. I did the same thing. Yeah. Oh, I see you've recently returned from Toulouse."
00:51:13,00:51:23,Because they've got a big suitcase with TLS on it. I bought this t-shirt in Toulouse
00:51:23,00:51:26,two days ago in March 2025.
00:51:26,00:51:38,"Okay, that is it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you want to get"
00:51:38,00:51:42,"in touch with anyone here today, they are all on social media. James, what are you on?"
00:51:42,00:51:47,"Well, I'm on all sorts. But let's say this week that I'm on Instagram at gnosis thing as James"
00:51:47,00:51:52,"Harkin. Okay, Andy. I'm on police guy at Andrew Hunter M. Dan's on the toilet."

00:52:10,00:52:15,"episodes that you can binge on, as well as links to various things like merchandise,"
