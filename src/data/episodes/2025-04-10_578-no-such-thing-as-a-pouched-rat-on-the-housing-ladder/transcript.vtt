 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:26.240
 from the QI offices in Holborn. My name is Anna Tyshinski and I'm sitting here with James Harkin,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.800
 Andrew Ontemuri and not Dan Schreiber this week. How much are we sharing about the reasons for

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.720
 his indisposition? Well he did message us this morning saying that he was sick so unfortunately

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.440
 he's not here but we've all done the research already so we're going to do it anyway. Yeah.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.800
 So let's start with fact number one and because I'm hosting this week that is my fact and my fact

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.080
 this week is that a rat in Tanzania just retired after preventing 30,000 people from getting TB.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.440
 Lovely. So this is a named rat. It's a named rat. It's not like a woman gives birth every six seconds.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:10.320
 Every time I click my fingers a rat retires. Yeah. A rat who's prevented thousands of TB cases.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.760
 It's a specific rat, Carolina. Yes and it's just something to make you all listeners and us feel

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.720
 quite underachieving about what we've done with our lives. This is genuinely the effect it had on me.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:29.120
 Carolina, she's an African giant pouch rat and she screens Flem samples for TB and she does it

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.760
 very quickly, much more effective than humans with microscopes or much quicker and they worked

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.840
 out that over seven years working in this job she's detected over 3,000 cases of TB and that

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.040
 means that she's stopped it spreading because it spreads to a certain number of people so I think

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.760
 it spreads to between 10 and 15 people per infected person. So by screening it you stop it from

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.640
 spreading and so she's probably spared 30 to 45,000 people from getting it and probably saved over

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.680
 5,000 knives in her 70 year career. So have they put her in a nice home? Yes, they have actually.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.160
 They put her with her friend. They do get a really nice retirement. Wait a minute. This is her friend

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.040
 that she's been working with all this time, right? Like no offense to you guys but I don't really see

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.520
 my retirement as sitting on a porch and a rocking chair next to you two. Are you crazy? This is

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.240
 going to be so much fun. I haven't even looked that far ahead yet. I think that's going to be

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.120
 brilliant. Yeah, I've found us a spot in Florida. We can park us for the entire home, you know?

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.320
 Yeah, kill them off early, all the other inhabitants. These rats are unbelievable.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.160
 They're so cool. I find it absolutely incredible and this is an amazing non-profit company called

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.360
 Apopo, APOPO based in Tanzania and Ethiopia and yeah, it uses these giant pouch rats for various

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.080
 things and they have these incredible centers of smell. Yeah, they're faster as well. They can do

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.360
 100 samples in 20 minutes and the human equipment is much slower. Cheaper, I bet.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.160
 They are a lot cheaper. They're very unionized. And they pick it up way more. So the classic

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.120
 testing method picked up about 60% of cases or for people who had HIV as well, it was only about

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.880
 20% of cases that got picked up. The rats, when they just smell a sample from a patient, they pick

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.640
 up about 70%. So they're really good. And humans have this ability, like in the middle ages, doctors

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.920
 would ask patients, this is really cool to cough on a hot coal or spit on a hot coal and that would

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.560
 generate a bit of a smell because it cooks it. Really? And the doctor will use that for diagnosis.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.400
 I think that works. Well, yeah, in the middle ages, famously human lifespan was very long.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.480
 No, but you can smell TB if someone's got a really advanced case of it.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.400
 The Dutch word for TB is tering, which means the smell of tar or it comes from the smell of tar,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.040
 because that's what it smells like. So yeah, I'm having read this, do feel like we haven't really

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.160
 done very much with our lives apart from and I'm now taking out a piece of paper. It's a certificate.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.720
 And Andy, do you want to read this certificate? Oh my god, this certificate recognizes that no

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.840
 such thing as a fish has officially adopted Tamasha, who uses her exceptional sense of smell

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.600
 to save lives by sniffing out TB samples in Tanzania. So we have an official no six thing

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.760
 as a fish. Oh my god. Pouched rat. Where's it? It's us saving the lives now. When do we get to retire?

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.800
 So if you want to sponsor a giant pouched rat, then you just go to apopo.org and you can do it

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.200
 there. I think it's 12 quid a month or something. So nice. That's the same as the license fee.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:38.400
 Well, I don't pay that. So I do. We are sponsored today. They actually have not a bad life. They

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.400
 are lazy. They only have to work for about 10 minutes a day. I don't really understand why

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.760
 they make them work so little. They just put them in this glass container and they put the

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.880
 TB samples. And these are TB samples that have had negative results from the classic test that

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.960
 Andy mentioned, which aren't very reliable. So they're very expensive tests, which are very

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.720
 reliable. The classic test is not spitting on a rock. No, there's another test.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.440
 Yes, sorry. It's not the spit on the fire and sniff it. It's the classic cheaper medical test

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.760
 that gets sent around rural areas. Not very reliable. So if you get a negative result from

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.400
 that, it gets sent to the rats. And then they sniff at it. And because they're so fast,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.760
 they'll cover enough cases per day in 10 minutes to then stop. And then once they retire,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.520
 they get this big enclosure. Like I say, she's hanging out with her friends. They have a big

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.320
 party. They get cheered. They get carrot cake. They get a good life.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.560
 It sounds amazing. So this place where they are, I think this is the place in Tanzania is in a

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.200
 place called Moragoro. And there are all sorts of rats doing all sorts of different things.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.560
 It's incredible. Like there's the landmine rat division over here. There's the TB rat division

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.000
 over here. Every year, this center gets through 25,000 bananas, 6,000 avocados and a ton of peanuts.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.320
 Literally one ton. It's a mashers favorite food, this avocado. Which that's so nice.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.000
 Avocado and banana smoothie seems to be their food of choice. So we'll send to them.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.600
 They'll never get there. They'll never afford a house.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:07.840
 Yeah. So the landmine thing, you kind of glossed over a little bit. But yeah, there are these rats

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:14.880
 that can find landmines because landmines smell a little bit like TNT. And they can smell the TNT.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.200
 And what you do is you get two humans and you walk down a stretch where there might be some

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.000
 landmines. But the landmine's possibly in between you. So you're not walking in a dodgy bit.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 And then you tie a bit of rope to your leg. And then the rope attaches to your rat. And then

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.520
 another rope attaches your mate to the rat as well. And you walk down while the rat sort of walks

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.040
 between you and sweeps the area. So they don't run away basically.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.200
 Okay. So imagine a three-legged race at sports day, but with the rat in between and the high

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.320
 charts are being blown up. Yeah. But also the rope that's tying your legs together is a good few

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.280
 meters long. You're not that close to your person. Because the rats are too light to set off landmines.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.560
 That's the idea. Yeah. The one problem is you have to remove all the vegetation first because

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.920
 they're only rats. They're not that big. Well, they're big for rats, but they're still pretty

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.680
 small. So the removal of the vegetation might set off the landmines as well. Okay. So those are the

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.360
 real heroes of the gardening rats who are sent out. Yeah, they have like these lawn mowing machines

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.280
 that they sent out. So there's no humans involved in those. Oh, like a Zumba. Rumba.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.400
 Like a Zumba rumba. Didn't they say, "I get knocked down, but I get knocked down."

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:33.920
 The Epopo team in Mozambique, they've destroyed 13,000 landmines. And Mozambique is now landmine

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.240
 free. And they declare that partly because of the work these rats have been doing. And then when

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.280
 they have cleared a piece of land, staff from Epopo have to do a handover ceremony to the locals in

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.920
 the area. And they have to run around across the land to prove that it's safe. Oh, really? Yeah.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.280
 Because otherwise, how are you going to trust it? So like you really have to... That's putting your

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.440
 money where your mouth is, isn't it? I'm glad we didn't have tests like that at QI. If your rat has

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:04.240
 a cold that day, look out. Yeah. Look many eyes, Masha. Do you promise? Before you do any landmine

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:11.520
 detection, you need to do one thing. I'm the rat. You're the rat handler. Yeah. What do you have to

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.480
 do to your rat before they go out? Make friends? Make friends? No. Not bothered about that. Oh,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.800
 I would have thought... Business like... Establish a bond. Okay. I mean, tie the rat to you. It's a

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:27.040
 massage. What? Who's massaging who? It's a massage of kind. With a happy ending. Rub your rat's nose.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.720
 Jesus Christ, Adam. Why? That's right. Because they can't concentrate on looking for landmines if

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.000
 they're horny. It's like, you know, football managers stay the day you get it all out of the

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.560
 system or something. I don't think Alex Ferguson was doing that to his players. The hairdryer

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.320
 treatment is actually something completely different. It's trying to go in the order of

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.880
 biography, but I'm telling you. Oh my goodness. No, you need to bring us back to reality. You need

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.840
 to rub sun cream into their ears. Oh, really? Why? Because if you look at this picture of

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.440
 Tamasha here, she's got quite... You can see the skin on her ears, right? Oh, that's going to burn.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.080
 Yeah. And they spend a lot of time underground normally. So basically, they can get burnt. And

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.800
 they would get in ear cancer, actually, some of them. Oh, really? In the very early days. So now

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.240
 all handlers have to apply sun cream before they go out to work. That's great. Maybe their nose and

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.600
 paws too, actually, because those are the bits which are a bit more flashy. That's so nice. They're

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.320
 nocturnal, aren't they? A lot of them. So they have to... That's so sweet. And do you know why

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.960
 they're all so good? The smelling things. The smelling? Yeah. Why? Well, it's all to do with

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.720
 their love life. So males have to be able to tell which females are sexually available.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:43.040
 Females have really delayed sexual development. So any males which can tell are at a big advantage.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.600
 If you can tell which females are ready to mate, you're in a much better position. Right. Because

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.120
 lots of them aren't. Because lots of them aren't. So there's this weird thing you can measure which

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.000
 shows you which males are really, really, really good at this. It's the, I'm sorry to say it,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.320
 it's the anogenital distance. So it's the distance between the rat's scrotum and his bottom. A male

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:10.160
 with a longer one of those, if those two things are further apart, then they can smell the difference

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.320
 much better between available and non-available females. This sounds like reflexology or something.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.320
 You get, oh, your anogenital implies that you'll really smell out those ladies. It's to do with

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.360
 sexual hormones. So rats which have the sexual hormones in their system have a greater one of

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:31.200
 those distances. My rat's got a long anogenital distance. How does he smell? He smells very well

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.240
 because of his long anogenital distance. Brilliant. Yeah. One thing I've said before on this podcast,

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.520
 in fact, I think the only time we might have mentioned pouched rats before is the fact that

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:49.120
 females vaginas tend to seal up from time to time. So they are open when they're ready to mate. But

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:55.760
 if they're not going to mate, they close. And also, if you have like a senior female there who's

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.000
 like the main one who's going to be mating, she can send out a signal which makes all the other

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.080
 females vaginas close up. And what I didn't say last time is that if a female with an open vagina

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:15.440
 dies, then all of the other females in the area, their vaginas will open. What? No. You can hear

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:22.880
 a little pop, pop, pop, pop. Imagine a funeral in the pouch rat world. Suddenly all the females in

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.880
 the river are all opening their vaginas. And it really went because we don't have this ability,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.760
 do we, to close and open them? I mean, as far as I know. No, because they're sealed. Like they're

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.560
 really closed up. Like they're properly closed up. It looks like closing your legs. No, it's

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:44.000
 like becoming a Barbie doll. It's like it just goes. It's bizarre. We should say while being heroes,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.440
 absolutely disgusting and I still want them all to go away. Because they're huge. They're massive.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.600
 Yeah. They're not rats as well, aren't they? They're not rats. They're not rats. No. I mean,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:12:00.000
 Tamasha here on our certificate, she looks quite like a rat. It looks like a rat and acts like

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 a rat and smells like a rat. Well, probably doesn't smell like a rat. But, you know, to all intents

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.560
 and purposes, it's a rat. But it turns out that they're not related. They're related to rats.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.360
 Yeah, I know. They have bodies, as National Geographic put it, which I liked. They're bodies,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:21.680
 so not including their tails, are longer than a 13-inch MacBook Air. What a stupid thing to say.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.600
 But you can't say longer than a MacBook Air because they're probably shorter than a 15-inch

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.640
 MacBook Air. Well, think of something else. They're longer than a 12-inch ruler. Oh, yeah, thanks.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.000
 You know, I think what that means is they're longer than 13 inches. And so that does mean that

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.440
 with tail included, they get up to 35 or 36 inches long, like three feet long. Okay, that's massive.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:49.840
 One of these pouch rats is bigger than the world's smallest deer in both weight and length. Whoa.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:55.440
 So that's the lesser mouse deer versus the giant pouch rat. That's striking. Who, I'd watch that

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.080
 fight. Yeah, the rat's easily going to win, actually, isn't it? Yeah, I'm afraid so. No, it's going to be a walk over.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:11.280
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that while

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:16.800
 locked away to choose a new pope, cardinals used to be banned from eating pies because it was too

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.720
 easy to hide messages in them. So good. I don't think it is easy. Are you joking? It would be so

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:28.320
 soggy. You can't read a message once it's, you know, been drowned in stock. Well, you insert it in a dry

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.440
 bit of the pie, a dry chunk of beef or whatever, or a dry mushroom. I mean, not for you, James, but

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.000
 you know. I'm not having any of your pie. It says how dry are your pies? I think the point is it's a

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.680
 secret pie, not the point that you have to combine the message and a terrific pie.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:47.920
 And the other thing, the other thing I banned was whole chickens as well, didn't I? So no. So this is

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:53.840
 from an article on JSTOR about conclaves, and it was mentioning Chef Colbert Elimeo Scappi,

00:13:53.840 --> 00:14:01.360
 who was catering for the conclave between Paul III and Julius III in 1549. And yeah, according to

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:07.360
 his description, you cannot send enclosed pastries or whole chickens nor wine in any vessel but of

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.720
 glass that was not first opened out and examined. And basically, yeah, he had all these rules just

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:19.760
 so that they couldn't cheat because really, it was a very secretive thing and lots of kings and

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:25.280
 queens around Europe were trying to influence it and stuff. And also people from the outside wanted

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.680
 to know what was happening because he would gamble on it and stuff like that. So yeah. Is the idea that

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.680
 let's say the king of Spain wants the Spanish cardinal to get the gig as pope, he'll put something

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:41.440
 in the pie saying, I'll give you 10,000 Florence if you vote for Cardinal Juan or whatever it is,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.800
 isn't it? That's the idea. Yeah. Oh, that's a fear, I guess. And I did read that these rules were

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:52.640
 basically completely ineffective. And even though they existed, secret messages just always got in

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:59.200
 and out in those days. There was a 16th century conclavist, so a conclavist was one of two assistants

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.280
 that each cardinal was allowed to help them inside get dressed and clean their teeth and, you know,

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.800
 they needed servants. Anyway. Well, yeah, you can't do a conclave if you're sexually frustrated,

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:16.000
 so something has to happen before you start. I won't hear such slander about the Catholic Church.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:24.320
 A conclave who wrote that Charles V pretty much knows when they urinate in this conclave.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.040
 That's the level of detail he's getting about the information. Wow. Interesting. And the point

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.040
 was, I suppose, this is a really, really, really powerful job. You have a huge amount of influence

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.480
 over the course of Europe. Oh, yeah. So I guess you do want to try and novel it. Yeah. I didn't

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.440
 know what conclave meant. It means with a key. Oh, yeah. Because you're locked up with a key.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.360
 Yeah. That's basically it. Conclave here. Yeah. It's funny you didn't know what it meant because

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:52.720
 we've mentioned it on the podcast before. I don't listen to this show. This one you're talking

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.280
 about, James, this was the 1549 one, wasn't it? Correct, yeah. Which lasted two months,

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:02.640
 which was actually pretty zippy for your average medieval conclave because there was a really,

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.760
 really, really long one, which we may have mentioned before, which took 33 months,

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.440
 which is Gregory the 10th. Yeah. And that was a bit embarrassing for all concerned,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.640
 and he changed the rules. Well, that's why they're locked away now. Because in that one where it

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:20.160
 was three, however, three years or whatever it was, they kind of met and then they would go home

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.760
 and just mess around and then they would go and play golf or whatever. And then they would come

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.160
 back and they say, have we decided yet? And then they were like, no, no. And so from then on, yeah,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.360
 Gregory came up with a rule saying, okay, well, we're going to make a new rule. You have to all

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.120
 go into the house and you can't leave the house until we have a decision. It's big brother,

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.760
 basically. And then if you don't have a decision after three days, he gets cut down to one meal

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.400
 a day. And then if you don't have anything after eight days, you just get bread and water plus wine.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.960
 So you've got to have wine. That is like a brother, isn't it? They used to just like give them

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.120
 very, very meager rations. Did the people in Big Brother over accidentally select a new post though?

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.800
 No, John Tickle has been the pope for the last eight years. Cardinal Tickle.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:08.000
 But the super long one that went on for over three years or whatever, they eventually after

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.160
 reducing their rations and everything, eventually they took the roof off with the argument being

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.720
 that it must be that the Holy Ghost can't get its message to us through this roof. So we better

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.040
 take the roof off to improve access. But I think the idea was maybe that that might make it even

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.120
 less comfortable if you've got. Yeah, whether exposed to the elements or that. I think it's

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.200
 all reasonable. They're just trying to hustle it up. You know why it's just the cardinals that vote?

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.520
 When you're voting for the pope, it's all the cardinals going to this room and they have to

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.880
 come up with the idea. But it used to be that everyone in Rome could vote. Really? Yeah, until 1059.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:43.680
 Did they keep voting in like, voting in the boat face or stupid people?

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:51.280
 You know why it is a bit like that. Popey book pope. Yes. So this was Benedict the 10th. The previous

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.320
 pope had made the Roman people swear an oath that they wouldn't elect a new pope until his

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:02.080
 favored person had returned from a trip to Germany. So he was dying. He was like, I want this guy to

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:08.960
 be pope. Don't vote for anyone else before he gets back. Anyway, this Benedict the 10th,

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.400
 his family had loads of money and so they bribed everyone to vote for them. So they voted for him.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.840
 And in the meantime, this guy's mate, who was Nicholas the second, he's in Germany. He's going,

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.160
 what the hell's going on? I'm supposed to be pope. And he's with a load of other cardinals

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.680
 and they go, well, we're going to make you pope anyway. So then we have two popes. Then Nicholas

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.160
 the second comes back to Rome, declares war on Benedict the 10th. They have a big old fight,

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.960
 loads of people die, and then Nicholas eventually wins, sends Benedict to jail and said, okay,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:42.320
 from now on, only the cardinals vote because we can't trust the people. Because the cardinals

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.880
 won't be bribed, but the people might be. That's very surprisingly democratic to say everyone in

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.360
 Rome gets to stick their aura in about you as to be pope. Yeah, but I mean, really the pope was

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.880
 effectively, you know, the leader of Rome, like Bishop of Rome. Yeah, even though he was a religious

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.800
 thing, he was the guy who was in charge. Although no one else is getting voted democratically,

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.760
 were they? That's true. You know, ahead of their time, the Catholics, I've always said it.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:12.560
 If someone is a likely candidate for the papacy, they're known as papabile,

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:18.880
 which literally means popable. You're pretty papabile. Not to be confused with the pokemobile.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:28.240
 It should not be pope. So a lot of this is in the recent, there's a movie recently

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:34.000
 out called conclave. Amazing movie. It's so good. It's so good. It was written by Robert Harris,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.600
 wasn't it? The book is written by Robert Harris, which and it has a lot of good research in it.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.840
 Yeah, yeah, he really did. He like he visited a lot. He spent a lot of time talking to people

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:48.400
 in the know. So I did find I was looking at the kind of trivia of, you know, about the movie.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.880
 And firstly, I found a Benedictine website, which had a Catholic Film Club podcast,

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.680
 their episode about conclave was titled conclave clueless evil or both.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.320
 So they did not like it as much. Anyway, look, here's this fact I found from the,

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.840
 this is all from, I think, from the IMDB. It's just about when someone becomes pope,

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.800
 how they change. It was reported when Francis became pope to the current guy,

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.760
 that on his elevation to pope, he contacted his Buenos Aires news agent personally to let him

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.720
 know he wouldn't be continuing his custom of returning the rubber bands from his daily newspaper

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:29.600
 at the end of each month. Power really changes people. No spoilers for conclave. But can I

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:37.200
 talk about Pope Joan? So Pope Joan, people might know this is a theory that we had a female pope

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.120
 in the Middle Ages. And I think most people think it's definitely not true.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.440
 Right. But there are some people who think it is true and some relatively serious people who

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:53.200
 think it is true. There are definitely in museums in Italy, chairs that were used by the pope,

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:59.120
 which have holes in the bottom of them. 100%. So in theory, you could check the anal genital

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:05.920
 region of the pope. This is a giant pouch wrapping the coat. Damn, I should have sealed it up.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:11.520
 And we did have rap singer. So who knows, would anyone properly check?

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:17.360
 Kind of a rap singer. Brilliant. Brilliant. So yeah, the idea being that people say you

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:22.080
 use these chairs to check the genitals of the pope to make sure that they're...

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.800
 And it's when they become pope. It's not for daily use. It's sort of,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.560
 you get named pope and then they check, which is pretty stupid because you would think you would

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.640
 pop them in the chair first. But whether or not that's true, the chairs definitely do exist.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.200
 Some people think they might have been to check that the new pope hadn't been castrated.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.720
 Right. Some people think that they were originally Roman imperial birthing stools.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:49.040
 Okay. And the idea is that the papacy was trying to show that they were imperial and important.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.600
 And so they use this very old Roman birthing stool as a throne.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.920
 Could the hell get a different old Roman stool? Couldn't they have gone to the museum

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.440
 and been like anything except the one that women gave birth through?

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.200
 Yeah. Or it could have been a b-day.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:08.880
 Yeah. But yeah, we basically don't know why they have these chairs.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:14.000
 But there are, you know, there's the odd, probably not massively serious, but there are the odd

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.320
 historian that thinks that this might be true. This guy called Michael E. Habicht,

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:23.360
 who's an archaeologist at Flinders University. And he found lots of coins from the era.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:28.240
 Of when Pope John was there and found that they had slightly different monograms.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.480
 Or what, like a typo John for John? Maybe they had, maybe there were two different

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.520
 popes at that time. And why were there two different popes? Or maybe because they found

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.320
 that one of them was a woman and they had to, yeah, we don't know.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:43.680
 They mint coins in between popes. In the Middle Ages, they would mint a coin,

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.080
 which had the crossed staffs, but no pope because there was no pope.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.720
 So if they minted a coin during that period, it had to be a special,

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.560
 there's no pope when we're making this coin. And they still do it these days, but with a euro.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.960
 Well, the between papers these period used to be quite interesting,

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.880
 because it went a bit lawless apparently, because the pope was essentially the legal

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:06.480
 authority in Rome. Once all the popes disappeared for their conclave, Rome went quite mad. There

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:12.000
 was one time where, they should bring that back. Yeah, that's great. Whenever the pope dies,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.960
 everyone just goes full on perch. Just losing. Or crime is legal.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.400
 Well, in fact, they basically did it. This was, I think it was in the 14th or 15th century,

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.720
 where as soon as the cardinals disappeared to decide the new pope, the local authorities

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.720
 hired a wizard to come and take control of the city to purge it of plague.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:35.360
 Sorry, I know Dan's not here, but if you've got his notes, I thought we have to have a nod to the

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:41.760
 poor guy. And yeah, this guy, Demetrios, used to lead this wild bull through the streets calling

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.640
 out for the plague to be dispersed. So good. Do you not think he maybe misunderstood what

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.680
 a papal bull was? Superb. Superb. Very esoteric joke.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:57.440
 How many papal bull puns are going around these days? Can I talk very briefly about this guy?

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:04.160
 Scappi. Bartolomeo Scappi. The chef. The chef, the papal chef. He was an amazing guy. He was

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:10.080
 one of the first ever international celebrity chefs. He was the cuoco segreto to the popes,

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:15.200
 the secret cook, which probably means the personal private cook to the popes. While

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.720
 Michelangelo was next door doing up the Sistine Chapel. So it was a time of great lavish stuff.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:28.880
 And he had amazing recipes. He made incredibly elaborate things. So, you know, he would make,

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:36.320
 he would serve 60 course meals. Too much. It's more of a tasting menu. Is it one where you

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.040
 still leave hungry? You actually have to have McDonald's before you go. There's a chippy just

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:47.200
 outside the Chappy restaurant. But he was an amazing guy, clearly. And he arrived after

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:52.160
 Leo the 10th, who was one of the most lavish popes ever. Leo the 10th was made pope on his first

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.840
 day through a massive fireworks party and feast, then disappeared for the night with his lover,

00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:02.720
 who he then made the Cardinal of Sienna. Those were the days of being a pope. But Chappy got stuck

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.880
 in this thing. He got caught up in a wave of puritanical reform. So when Pius the fifth came in,

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.600
 he was planning this huge, great party, Chappy. And it would have been an amazing banquet. He

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:20.160
 wanted to do miniature food castles with live birds in them. Incredible. A jelly pope effigy.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:25.520
 Jelly pope. Fantastic. And then he got told, oh yeah, Pius the fifth is actually planning a big

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:32.320
 wave of reform. And he just wants a boiled egg for his supper from now on. I know. So then he wrote

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:38.880
 this book, Chappy, the opera dell'arte del cuginare, 1570, contains the first ever picture of a fork,

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.520
 some of the first ever recipes for stuffed pasta. Like if you were hoping for an opera from the

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.720
 book, that's what's confusing. It is called the opera. No, but he just did after a 60 cost meal,

00:25:48.720 --> 00:26:02.400
 the fat lady. She was thin at the start. Okay, it's time for fact number three and that's Andy.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:08.160
 My fact is there is only one grade one listed dog kennel in the UK.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:14.000
 Really? Yeah, yeah. And I visited it the other day. No, I did. I visit it's this place in Kent

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.120
 called item moat. And it's like it's a beautiful medieval manor house and it's got a moat all

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.720
 the way around it. And it dates back to the 14th century. National trust, it's bloody good. The

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.840
 trees for the oldest bits of item moat date back to the 1320s. So it's really old this place.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:35.440
 And it had this kennel built attached to it in the 1890s when they were doing a bit of work on the

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.920
 house. And because the kennel is attached to a grade one listed property, which we should say is

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.880
 the highest possible grade of listing in the UK. So you're not allowed to do anything to it. It's

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.880
 protected. You're not allowed to do anything. If something's grade two listed, you can maybe move

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.840
 the furniture around, maybe do a bit of interior decorating grade one listed, just leave it alone.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.640
 Like it's really historical that stuff. And so this kennel is now grade one listed. It's a nice

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.920
 kennel. It's really massive. It was made for a St. Bernard dog. It's quite plain. It's wooden, but

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.120
 it's nice. You know, it's got the classic roof shape, the eaves. Does it look like just a classic

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.800
 what a child would draw? It's a classic kennel, I would say. Yeah, yeah. It's really good. Yeah.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.720
 This is very cool. Just to say on the place, it's absolutely fantastic. It's got a

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:24.080
 billions room because I bought the guide because I'm deep into my national trust years now.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:29.600
 Are you a member? Oh yeah. Of course you are. You do it for the parking there, don't you?

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.080
 I just like this. This was a detail in the guide. It has a billions room with a door

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.880
 which opens directly onto the moat, which is quite cool. What? You walk up the door, you

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.200
 find the moat. That's what it sounds like. Well, you go in the house over the bridge,

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.440
 and then you go into the billions room, and then there's a door at the other end of the

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.080
 billions room, and you open it, you're in the moat. But why? Because then you fall into the

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:56.880
 moat. Yes. Okay, so why does that exist? Well, I'm coming to that. I didn't feel like you were to

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.880
 be honest. I'm just looking at us like our questions are unreasonable. You might use it

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.760
 if you wanted to go for a swim in the moat, or if you needed to get into the moat, but there was

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:09.600
 an unfortunate secondary use, which is if the loo is too far away, and you want to just,

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.760
 you know, relieve yourself in the billions room without going all the way to the loo,

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:18.080
 you pee into the moat. Pop your bum out. All right. And probably your front.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:23.280
 Okay, you're doing it. It's for a number one. Only man would be allowed to do this, probably.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:33.600
 They're pausing their billions game to have a shit in the moat. I think that's a bit uncouth.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:39.840
 Well, that's how we draw the line, is it? I see. Well, if it flows past the window

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.080
 where the ladies are having their drinks. I don't know, Andy, I'm not sure.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.760
 No, I like it. I'm going one installed in my house. I'm just reading what's in the guide.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:54.080
 They did use to be quite elaborate dog kennels. It's funny how much we valued dogs historically,

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.000
 at least in Britain. And it's basically because of hunting, so because they were so valuable.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.760
 And so from medieval times to the 19th century, big manna houses had a bunch of hounds and they

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:10.960
 bloody loved them. I was reading a hunting manual, which had chapter after chapter on how to build

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:15.200
 a kennel and what the right kennel should be. And it said, you know, the benches within the

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:20.320
 kennel around the edges need to be the perfect height for the dogs to rest on. So they want to

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.880
 rest above ground level, but not so high that it'll be tiring for them to jump up onto after a long

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:31.280
 day's hunting. Okay. So five foot wide, two point five foot high. They need at least one fireplace

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:37.200
 to curl up in front of with a chimney or maybe two chimneys. They also need a little dog to do a

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:44.080
 shit out of it. Famous painting of the dogs or playing cards. What you don't see is the little

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:50.640
 doorway. Yeah, yeah, they need several yards, one paved and one grass so that they can have a bunch

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:56.720
 of different, you know, surfaces to play on as much sunlight as possible in the yards, but also

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:02.320
 shade options. And yeah, and they need to be cleaned every day. They really love, it wasn't just that

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.800
 hounds were there as a utility thing. They were really attached to them. And they needed a person

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:12.400
 in the kennels living with them at all times. Come on. Who's going to feed the fire otherwise?

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:19.280
 Exactly. That's not much of a job, is it? The dog boy? I feel not. I think you probably,

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:25.680
 maybe you got to climb the ranks to be top dog. You were Lord of the Manor at the end.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.160
 But apparently, yeah, he, the dog boy or some other child must be constantly in the kennel

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.400
 to be preventing fights between the dogs even at night. Oh gosh, that is a rough gig.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:41.040
 Rough. Because if you're just putting another log on the fire and you know,

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.320
 putting the dogs to bed, talking about reading their story, that's fine. But if the fight's

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.960
 going to break out at night. I feel like it would. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how you break up a fight

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.960
 between a bunch of dogs in the kennel. I believe you're a boy. I think you're up the bum, don't you?

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.880
 I think that is. Is that what you do? Well, that is a definite, if a dog's clamped its

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:02.160
 jaws around your leg, that is the thing to do. Finger up the bum. Or ask a nearby friend to

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:07.600
 do the same. So maybe you have two dog boys in there. Yeah. Do you know what the most expensive

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:14.320
 kennel of all time was? Oh no. Is it gasable? No. Is it has a hole in the roof? That's a clue.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.160
 Oh, do we know this? Can we work out why it has a hole in the roof? It might be a chimney.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:24.640
 That hole is what makes it very expensive. Oh. And this is a kennel. Yes. Small hole. It was

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:34.400
 sold for $44,100 in 2019. Sorry, in 2020. Oh, it's a historic kennel. It's the kennel that,

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:40.240
 no, hang on. Let me get to the end of the wrong answer. The kennel that Scott of the Antarctic

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.960
 took with him for the sled dogs. I see. And it's got a small hole in the roof because

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.240
 you'd burn a fire in there to keep the dog's wall. Very good. No. Yep. Good. Thank you.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:53.760
 What might make a hole in a roof? A bird falling. Might not make a hole. It probably

00:31:53.760 --> 00:32:01.200
 bounce off his tin roof. Okay. Meteorite. You are meteorite. That is correct. Wow. This was

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:08.560
 the only known dog kennel to have been hit by a meteorite. And it was sold by Christie's in 2020.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:16.480
 Sorry. Who the hell paid $44,000 for that? That's insane. Someone insane. Is it Dan Schreiber? Did

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.840
 it say who'd bought it? It was Dan Schreiber. What happened to the dog? Oh, the dog was fine.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.480
 Yeah. He doesn't have a house anymore because they sold it. Right. But he wasn't hurt by the

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.640
 meteorite. So that's good. Well, that's good. People go nuts for meteorites though. Did it come

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:36.080
 with the meteorite? I believe not. Okay. That is some salesmanship that has happened there.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:42.720
 One careful owner. There were a series of luxury dog kennels recently. One of them,

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:47.760
 when it was sold, came with the warning that the dog was not included, which I quite like.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.160
 This was, did you read back in 2018, a bunch of architects, world famous architects were

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:57.360
 invited to design these dog kennels. So like Zahar Hadid's company did one and all the world

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:02.800
 famous. You've buried the lead here. Lead, dog joint, good. Berry, dog's berry, fine. There's

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:08.880
 a dog event annually called Good Wolf, like Good Wood. And the event they have is called

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.200
 Barchitecture. And it's, they get famous architects to design kennels for dogs.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.200
 Oh, it's been happening every year now. Okay. And it's to raise money for Blue Cross.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.400
 Yes. I think it is in fact. They do look cool. I mean, some of them look amazing. You know,

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.480
 there's a, there's one called Bonehenge, which is very good. Nice. Is it all puns?

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:29.600
 Most, I mean, it doesn't hurt. I think there's a noise canceling kennel for use on fireworks

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.960
 night. Oh, that's a good idea. Very good idea. That's actually a little bit like Arizona in 2018.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:41.360
 There was a dog kennels. It was the Maricopa County Animal Care Company. And they had this

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.200
 program called Calming Companions, where they invited people to come and sit in their kennels

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:50.240
 with the dogs on the 4th of July. So that they could calm them down as the fireworks went off.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:55.680
 200 people rocked up. How do you calm a dog down when fireworks come off? Massage has evolved.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:01.040
 Honey, they read, they've read them stories as you suggested earlier. So you, there you go.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.280
 Oh, that's nice. Played the music, entertained the dogs, and then we're all ripped to shreds.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:12.000
 Do you know Princess Alexandra of Denmark, who was married to Edward the 7th?

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.240
 Yes. Yeah, of course. She was, she loved dogs. Love dogs. And she kept loads and loads of them

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:23.440
 at Sandringham. And there was a journalist called Sarah Tully, who was shown them and wrote about

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:29.520
 them. And they just seem amazing. Each kennel had a bedroom with an iron bedstead. Leading from

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.840
 the bedroom is a sitting room supplied with straw and a constant supply of fresh water.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:39.520
 If there's a sitting room, is there also a staying room, a rollovering room, a shake hands room?

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:45.840
 There is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which I believe is in America.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:53.680
 It's in New York. Yeah, they've got Mary Antoinette's dog kennel, which is very nice. It's more of a

00:34:53.680 --> 00:35:01.840
 little... Why didn't she sleep in a bed? She was very humble. Yeah, famously. So, and it's more

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:06.000
 of a carrying, you know, a plush carrying case kind of, because it's for a little dog, because I

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.200
 imagine she had a small dog. And it's, it was made by a master furniture maker. So it's got

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:17.840
 neoclassical acanthus leaves carved around the edges and it's, obviously it's gilded. The dog,

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.840
 amazingly, was imprisoned alongside Mary Antoinette. Supposedly. Oh, no, he didn't get his head chops

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:28.720
 after that. I don't think they had a smaller guillotine. I don't think so. There's something

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.840
 that's quite cute about that, though. No. I mean, it sounds cute, but then I think at the end it

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.520
 becomes less and less cute. You're right. And there's a moment where it switches, isn't there?

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:44.800
 There is a kennel in West Sussex near East Grinstead, which is a very interesting and weird

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:50.480
 place, which was built by Edwin Lutjens, who's one of the most famous architects that England is

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:56.240
 ever pretty. It was a huge deal. And it was built as a dog kennel, but it is currently, right now,

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:01.520
 as we recall this, it's on sale as a four-bedroom house. And it's one of these big kennels for a

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:06.960
 pack of dogs that Anna was talking about. And I've looked at the photos and it is nice.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.600
 I think it's more than a million quid. It's on sale for like, it's really...

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.600
 And dogs could afford that back in the day. Yeah. House prices were just a completely

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.400
 different ball game back in the day. A ball game. There's another one.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:27.200
 That's amazing. It's stunning. If you Google it, it's like, it's a beautiful home now. And it's

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.280
 four bedrooms. It's all on one floor, obviously, because it was built for the kennels. We could

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:35.680
 four bedrooms. We could do it. I mean, I'd love to live in that. No, that's not where we're retiring,

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:42.480
 guys. We'll get a dog boy to come and look after us. Put his finger up on his thumb every time we

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:55.760
 get angry. Okay, it is time for fact number four. And that is Dan Schreiber's facts. Dan, what's your

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:02.640
 fact today? My fact this week is that reenactment actors on America's Most Wanted run a higher

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:07.280
 risk of being arrested after the show goes out than normal actors. Tell us more.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:13.200
 No, he can't tell us more. He can't because he's indisposed. But James, you can tell us more.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:21.040
 I can because he gave us a link and it is from the San Diego reader and it was a letter. Someone

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:26.160
 said, "Hey, Matt." They've written to someone called Matthew Alice, who was a journalist here and said,

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.920
 "Are there any examples when actors in these crime-solving reality shows were spotted in the

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:38.560
 street and turned in thinking they were the actual perps?" And this was a letter from Langston in

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:43.280
 Spring Valley and this journalist called Matt replied and said, "Yeah, that is definitely the case."

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:49.360
 And there was one woman who played an evil nanny housekeeper who was forging employers checks and

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:55.760
 burned down their houses and the actor who played them was recognized by two teenagers and she was

00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:01.840
 hustled to the prison and they had to be straightened out afterwards using her social security

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:08.320
 number to prove that she was an actor. Because it's a good lie if you are an evil nanny who's

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:13.200
 been burning down people's houses and faking checks if you're arrested in the street. You say,

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.760
 "No, no, no, I'm one of the actors in the show." They use that image of me because for right reasons

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.280
 they couldn't use the image of the real criminal. It's probably worth everyone joining Equity just

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:26.720
 in case. I don't know if it's the most foolproof plan. But they do choose people who look similar,

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:32.400
 don't they? They do, for sure. I haven't seen America's Most Wanted ever. I saw Crime Watch

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.560
 a bit when it was on. Yeah, which is our British equivalent, by the way, but it's quite a different

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.560
 tone. America's Most Wanted, I watched a little bit of it and it's that American tone that's quite

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.560
 over the top and sensationalised and quite hard to watch. I should just explain very quickly that

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:49.120
 these shows, so Crime Watch and America's Most Wanted, basically there's a crime that's happened

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:54.000
 in the past and they do a recreation of that crime and then they have a phone number that you can

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.040
 call in case you have any details of what might have happened and then they'll give you a reward

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.960
 if they managed to catch the person who did it. Yeah. Yeah. And it has happened in the UK,

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:09.600
 like in Crime Watch there was a guy called Steve Watson who was in the reconstruction of a murder

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:15.600
 of a woman and it was shown on BBC One. This woman's called Julie Pacey and sure enough,

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.880
 people recognised him in the reconstruction and the police came and they brought him in and they

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:26.160
 did his fingerprints and DNA and stuff like that. Wait, the actor? The actor, yeah. So this is

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:31.840
 incorrect? Yeah, it's the same as what happened in America. But luckily, in this case, they had the

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:37.040
 DNA of the perpetrator of the murder, so they could tell that it wasn't him. I'm amazed that it

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.280
 actually works, America's Most Wanted. I couldn't believe it, yeah. Because they've brought in a

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.480
 lot of people over the years, like they were on for years and years and years and years and they

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:48.240
 would have a huge phone bank of people taking tips from members of the public after the show.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:53.840
 There was one, I don't know if you guys found Mark Goodman in 1988. Did you find this guy? No,

00:39:53.840 --> 00:40:00.400
 someone else found him. Superb. So he had committed a burglary, right? And he was in prison for it.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:06.960
 Okay. But he was wanted in a different bit of the country because he had been convicted for an

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:12.560
 armed robbery and then he'd escaped. So he was on the lamb for that crime, but he was in prison

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:17.760
 already for another one. He and his fellow lags were watching America's Most Wanted one night

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:22.720
 and his face came up on the screen. Wow. And he quickly tried to change the channel.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:29.520
 But it was too late. It's too suspicious. Play it cool. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Do you think, like,

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:36.000
 if you're a criminal, like, I don't really like watching panel shows on TV because it's my job

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.680
 and it's like, I know they're really good, but I just feel like, oh, that's my job. I don't want to

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.800
 do it when I'm off as well. I couldn't agree more. I would have thought if I was banged up,

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:48.240
 I wouldn't want to watch Crime Watch. No. Well, they did. And amazingly, what do you think the

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:52.800
 other prisoners did? They said, oh, well, we're all in it together. So let's definitely not dub

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.880
 you into the authorities. They stopped him into the authorities. I cannot believe the correct

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.400
 response is to give him a false mustache and say, oh, yeah, funny about your brother, you know.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:06.160
 That's prison morality for you, isn't it? I'm just really shocked. It's a doggy dog world.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:12.320
 Yeah. America's Most Wanted Alone has helped to catch over 1,200 fugitives and bring home

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:17.600
 loads of loads of missing children. Crime Watch has helped police with over 5,000 cases. So it is

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:23.040
 quite impressive. I think my favorite from America's Most Wanted Catches was this

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:29.840
 story set in the Green Parrot Cafe in Salt Lake City, Utah, which is incredible. Did you guys

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:34.880
 read about this? Hello. So basically, there was a robbery of that cafe in 1992, and it was a bit

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.560
 botched and someone ended up dead, like one of the staff, I think, in the cafe or one of the

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:44.800
 people in the cafe. And so a few months later, America's Most Wanted aired that and said,

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:49.120
 have you seen this killer? And all the staff at the cafe were like, oh, we're going to be on

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.280
 America's Most Wanted member because there was that murder in here a couple of months ago. Let's

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.520
 watch. So all the staff and all the patrons in there crowded around to watch and they watched the

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:02.480
 story and they watched, you know, have you seen this guy? And then there was another story after

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:07.360
 it that said, okay, on to the next one case of a child molester. Have you seen this man?

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:12.000
 And they kept the TV running and all the patrons and all the staff watching it went,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.280
 God, he looks a lot like, he looks so much like the guy who works in our kitchen,

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:18.160
 doesn't he? And then he said, gradually the manager was like, they were like,

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:25.520
 hang on, it is Tommy from the kitchen. And they, it was Kenneth, Kenneth from the kitchen.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:32.880
 And so they called up crime watch. Gave him a false mustache. He just watches that plate so well.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:39.200
 Sent him on his way. Wow. Isn't that a coincidence? That's insane. Yeah. It's a dangerous cafe to

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:46.320
 be going to. Yeah. All these shows are based off a German format called Akten Zeichen XY.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:53.920
 That means file reference XY unsolved. Ungerlust. Yeah. And this year, in fact, that TV show

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:59.200
 managed to catch a member of the Baader-Meinhof gang. And if you haven't heard of the Baader-Meinhof

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:04.160
 gang, you soon will, because that's what they're most famous for. As soon as you hear of them once,

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:07.200
 you always hear about them again sometime in the next couple of weeks.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.600
 The Baader-Meinhof effect. Is that what it's called? Yeah. They were basically a group of,

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:16.240
 they were like a Marxist terror group who were attacking people and robbing people because of

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:21.760
 the guilt of World War II or something like that. 70s? 70s and early 80s, yeah.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.280
 And sorry, is this show still going out in Germany? Yeah, yeah. And they just caught them.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:29.200
 They caught them this year. They said, oh, like, this is a thing that happened and they found this

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:35.120
 woman who was called Daniella Kletter, who was apprehended thanks to that. And she'd done violent

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:39.200
 acts during the 70s. And was it a bit of a 'forgiven-forget' kind of thing 50 years ago?

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.360
 Oh, you're so 'forgiven-forget'. I think generally speaking, they're not thought very highly of,

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:49.120
 the Baader-Meinhof group. No. Anna, there's a reason your Nazi hunting career stumbled on the blocks

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:53.760
 which is your milk of human kindness is so flowing. I just think it was so nice when you

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:59.840
 actually meet them. Do you know who voiced all of America's Most Wanted? Who's that?

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:04.560
 It's a man who, I think we've very, very briefly mentioned, but about eight years ago,

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:09.600
 he's a man nicknamed Old Thunderthroat, Don Lafontaine. He died about 10 years ago, 10,

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:14.880
 15 years ago. And he is the man who's behind every Hollywood trailer you've ever seen.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:19.920
 Is it that guy? In a world. And he did the voices on America's Most Wanted.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:25.200
 He didn't do the voices. He did the voiceover. Sorry.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.800
 Can you hear this one sound like Mickey Mouse? Oh, sure, I can! What?

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:39.040
 But I just got distracted reading about him. He would do up to 35 jobs a day around Hollywood

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:43.840
 voiceover. He was so in demand at the height of his career, just even in a world, you know, of

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:48.080
 crime. Just amazing voice. But Screen Actors Guild said he was the

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:53.280
 busiest ever member of their guild. Is that so? That's really good, because he doesn't have to go

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.520
 somewhere for three months on location. And, you know, like, a job's a job and it takes him a

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:06.160
 short time. He also invented the phrases "one man army", "one man, one destiny", and "from the bedroom

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:11.520
 to the boardroom", and "nowhere to run, nowhere to hide". Like, he invented all those phrases.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.200
 So, "nowhere to run, nowhere to hide" is something I say quite a lot. I very seldom...

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.600
 They might not be things he regularly says, but you do recognize them, though.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.160
 Like, "from the bedroom to the boardroom, I don't recognize".

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:25.600
 What does that mean? Is that you're shagging someone and then you hire them?

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:29.280
 Yeah. Or is it... I mean, you wake up in a bedroom, don't you? Mostly.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.120
 I don't know. What? It's just your morning routine.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.720
 Yeah, I get up in the bedroom. I typically wake in the bedroom when I go to the boardroom.

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.680
 I very seldom wake up in the boardroom and go to the bedroom.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.600
 It just doesn't feel like we need a saying for that.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.120
 You're right. I like it, though. I do like it.

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.320
 Because he often improvised these bits and wrote them himself.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.960
 Also, he really made those up. It wasn't like they were given to him and he said them.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.680
 Sometimes they would be, but sometimes he made them up himself.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:55.120
 Because he can't make up the plot of Terminator and just bust it once they've made the film.

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.520
 Like, they've made the film. They probably have an idea of what they wanted to say.

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.040
 That's really cool that he invented those phrases.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.040
 Do you know who does the theme tune for Crime Watch in the UK?

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:07.520
 No. This is a guy called John Cameron. He wrote it.

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:12.240
 And he also arranged the album Mellow Yellow by Friends of the Podcast.

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.320
 Saffron band, Donovan. He's suddenly popping up a lot, isn't he?

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.840
 He's a bloody bar of mine, hoping me.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:25.120
 The coolest thing I read about Crime Watch was they did a looking back over 40 years of it

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:29.200
 thing and interviewed a bunch of the presenters and asked them about their favorite moments.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.800
 And one of them, he was talking about how amazing the detectives are

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.760
 and how they spot these tiny things. And it's so Sherlock.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:42.240
 He said that the perpetrator's alibi was cracked because a detective noticed in a photo of the

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:48.000
 crime scene there was a drip coming from the kitchen tap and the suspects had admitted that

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.360
 he'd used the tap before leaving the house. But the police calculated how long it would have taken

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:58.800
 the kitchen sink to fill up with that dripping tap, dripping at that rate and realized it wouldn't

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:03.280
 have filled to the extent that it had if he'd been there at the time he'd said so he must have

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:07.280
 done the murder. Isn't that cool? That's incredible. That's Sherlock Holmes.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.680
 Yeah, it doesn't feel like it would stand up in car.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:16.320
 I've got a tap with trips and then every now and then you get like a little splurge.

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:20.160
 I know what you mean. It could have just stopped dripping for a while and then suddenly, yeah.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.640
 And it was just based on that. So it could be a wrong thing.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:28.960
 I was looking at the history of shows that tap in that basically allow the public to take part

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:36.800
 in crime solving. And the first example I could find was a TV show broadcast on the BBC in 1938

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:42.800
 called 'Telecrime' and it was actually a spin-off of a... 1938.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:46.720
 Yeah. Well, the public couldn't... That's so early. That's like they had to stop for the war.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:50.320
 They did not stop for the war. It was sort of that brief thing where there was TV in the UK,

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.960
 but no one had a set. It was exactly then, yeah. Yeah. The war was it. And then they did stop for

00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:00.080
 the war. Was it an invasion of Belgium? I mean, that is a big crime. That is a big crime. Have

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:06.960
 you seen this army? They have five million men. Oh, no. I think it's you, Fira. Quick, put up this

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:16.560
 moustache. Oh, no! It was based on a magazine series called 'Photo Crime' this way. You'd be

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:21.600
 shown all these pictures of crime scenes and then they'd write clues next to them and then you could

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:25.760
 work out who did it. And the way the show worked was it was fictional, by the way, so it was like

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:29.520
 a who done it. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it really invited you to work out who did it. So the

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:34.320
 idea of the show was they showed you enough evidence in the 15-minute show to work out who the killer

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:38.800
 was. And then just as the killer was about to be revealed, the screen suddenly phased a black

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:44.240
 and a big question mark came up. Really? And a voiceover came up saying, "Do you know who did it?"

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:47.920
 And then it paused on the screen for a couple of minutes while you could sit there at home on

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:51.680
 your sofa, noting down on the clues and working out. So there was a show only a couple of years ago

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:56.400
 called Armchair Detectives with Susan Kalman in it, which did a similar thing. It was absolutely

00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:00.640
 brilliant. And they never recommissioned it, I think, because it was extremely expensive to make,

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:07.600
 because effectively you were making an entire murder mystery play each week. You're making us an

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:11.760
 inspector morse. Yeah, and you needed loads of cast, and the cast couldn't be the same every week,

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:16.160
 because otherwise it would just not make any sense. And yeah, but it was a brilliant show.

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.680
 Oh, there you go, nicked it from a 1938 format, so cool. Yeah.

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:24.160
 I was looking at True Crime in general, because these shows, they have a big effect on people,

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.360
 and people's perceptions of crime, you know, how much crime you think there is. If you watch

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:30.640
 America's Most Wanted, you'll probably think there are more terrible crimes happening than

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:35.280
 there are, obviously. And, you know, podcasting, I find this amazing, because it's been studied,

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:41.120
 like, the effect of True Crime podcasting on people. So 35% of True Crime fans say they have

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:48.640
 investigated people around them. No. Yeah, because you start thinking, I could do this work.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:52.640
 Are they investigating their friends just to practice, or do they suddenly think

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:55.840
 they're friends or murderers, do we think? Does it make you very suspicious, or does it just

00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:00.720
 make you think, I'm going to sharpen my wits? Probably, yeah, probably just you see people

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.000
 acting like that on the show as an investigating, and probably it just helps you to have a go

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.720
 yourself. It doesn't make me want to listen to True Crime, it's going to make me think all my

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:10.800
 mates are murderers. But you're a woman, Anna, so you should like True Crime, as in many more women

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:15.840
 like. Okay, then I will. Enjoy True Crime than men, and women only like one thing, that's crime.

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:23.680
 I went to watch my favorite murderer, Hammersmith, and the audience percentage of women was through

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:28.720
 the roof. Really? Yeah, it was like being at a Guilty Feminist podcast. Right. There's many,

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:34.400
 many, many more women than that. So we are all quite sick and twisted. There are loads of theories

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:39.360
 as to why, like one theory is these stories contain kind of information about how to avoid crime. If,

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:43.920
 as a woman, you know, women, I think. Yeah, right, that's why they're listening. Come on,

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:49.600
 it's just a lascivious desire to hear some gruesome murders. I don't know. Or women empathize more with

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.600
 women victims of crime. That might be a thing. Yeah, like it's, yeah, I think you can see a

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:59.200
 lot of reasons. I must admit, when I, quite a few years ago now, I went back and read all of the

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:04.000
 Sherlock Holmes short stories. And I must admit, I'd be sat on the tube sort of looking at people's

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.560
 shoes and seeing if I could work out where they've been that day and stuff. That's kind of the same

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:13.360
 thing. Yeah, completely. I did the same thing. Yeah. Oh, I see you've recently returned from Toulouse.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:23.280
 Because they've got a big suitcase with TLS on it. I bought this t-shirt in Toulouse

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.240
 two days ago in March 2025.

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:38.000
 Okay, that is it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you want to get

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.640
 in touch with anyone here today, they are all on social media. James, what are you on?
