00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.080
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.680
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.400
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.640
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.800
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.920
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.200
 James Harkin and Alex Bell.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.360
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.260
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.640
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.680
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.080
 my fact this week is that the original voice

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.200
 of Porky Pig got fired for having a stutter.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.480
 - That is so unfair.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.840
 - It really is, isn't it?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.680
 Because they carried on with the stutter.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.200
 - Did they then do auditions for people being like,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.280
 you have to stutter?

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.840
 - Well, they didn't really need to do auditions

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.200
 'cause they had the great Mel Blank,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.520
 who is the finest voice of all time,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.720
 who eventually took over the role.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.480
 But the whole vocal styling of Porky Pig

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.360
 was created by a guy called Joe Doherty.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.400
 He's a guy who died 1978.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.720
 So he existed in like the early 1900s

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.120
 'cause Porky Pig was one of the original Looney Tunes,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.960
 if not the oldest.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.680
 - The oldest, the oldest continuous one, yeah.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.520
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.440
 And so he did it for two years,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.040
 but the issue was it was really messing up recording times

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.360
 'cause he couldn't control his stutter.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.200
 He'd get nervous.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.120
 - So he decided to give Porky Pig a stutter

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.560
 and then deliberately chosen him,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.880
 or was it like vice versa?

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.720
 - The first one.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.560
 - The first one.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.400
 - The first one, they decided to give him a stutter

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.160
 and then said, okay, we'll pick a guy with a stutter.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.960
 - So the guy who invented him was Fritz Freelink.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.480
 And he said that he wanted someone with a stutter

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.440
 because it would distinguish him from other characters.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.400
 Now, have you heard the original one?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.240
 - I have, yeah.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.080
 - It's like the new Porky Pig is like a fake stutter,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.320
 but the first one is just like a person with a stutter.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.160
 - Yeah, isn't it?

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.000
 - Exactly.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.840
 - And with a very different voice.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.680
 - They decided they didn't like the kind of stutter.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.720
 So they were like, we're going in a different direction.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.480
 - He was taking too long.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.800
 He just couldn't get through the words.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.800
 - Yeah.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.120
 - It just took way too long.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.120
 - It's really sad.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.960
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.800
 - 'Cause it's a bit like firing someone

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.920
 of having a disability and then hiring somebody

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.600
 to pretend to have that disability.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.440
 - Yeah.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.360
 - In a way, it wouldn't happen today.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.200
 - Yeah.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.040
 - You'd hope.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.880
 - You would hope not.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.200
 - So Porky first appeared in a movie,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.880
 short animation called I Haven't Got a Hat.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.360
 So that was 1935.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.280
 So he was there for the two years.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.160
 - Of course, easiest to write cartoons back then, wasn't it?

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.000
 For a laugh, that sounds like I haven't got a hat.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.920
 (laughing)

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.680
 - It was kind of, he wasn't the main character.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.000
 He never was meant to be a main character.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.600
 He was like a production, a musical production

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.920
 where they had a stage at school

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.400
 and everyone was getting out of their seats

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.760
 and Porky was really nervous.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.200
 So he's stuttering his way through the song.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.400
 But before Mel Blanc, who I said took over

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.760
 and is the voice that we all know and love,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.000
 there was one in between guy who was called Count Guttelli

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.600
 and Count Guttelli.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.600
 - He sounds like he is a Looney Tunes character.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.440
 - He does, doesn't he?

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.840
 - Did he go on to do Sesame Street?

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.480
 - Count Teno Guttelli.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.520
 This guy was known as The Big Noise.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.520
 Like he had 2000 sound effects to his name.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.800
 He was sought after by everyone.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800
 - Like that guy from Police Academy.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.520
 - Exactly, Michael Winslow, yeah.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.520
 And when he died, the Berlin Anthropological Institute

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.120
 offered $2,000 to his family to purchase his head and throat

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.360
 so that they could study it after death.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.440
 - Hang on, did they remove his head?

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.520
 - That's what they requested.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.280
 For $2,000, can you lob his head off with his neck,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.680
 which is quite a rare request, I would say.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.800
 - I feel like you probably get half the neck usually.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.200
 You go for the middle of the neck.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.960
 The whole neck is quite.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.040
 So would you have to cut it like a v-neck jumper

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.960
 or something to get the full thing?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.600
 - Did they accede to this request?

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.720
 - They did not, no.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.600
 They did not want to hand over the head or neck.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.240
 - Just fork out for the full body.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.960
 - If you want it that much, just have a three grand

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.400
 and take the whole thing. - That's weird.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.800
 - Somebody ends up with sort of just like the shoulders.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.720
 It's really weird to have a headless body.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.360
 - Yeah, who wants a lower half then?

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.600
 - I suppose they probably weren't giving away the rest of it.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.520
 They're probably burying that bit.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.560
 - I mean, people did used to get different parts

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.680
 of their body buried in different places, didn't they?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.520
 - They did.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.160
 - It used to be relatively common, I think.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.360
 - But still, I think the full head off,

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.880
 they seem to often take bits of the inside of the body off

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.640
 or the other thing down. - Like the heart or something

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.480
 like that, right? - Yeah.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.200
 - Einstein's brain was bigger than a normal brain

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.160
 was why they wanted it, right?

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.040
 - Yeah, the guy who invented head, shoulders, knees,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.320
 and toes, he's buried in four different places.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.240
 (all laughing)

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.920
 - Where his eyes is mouth and mouth.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.840
 (all laughing)

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.120
 - Actually speaking of being buried,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.120
 do you know what's on Mel Blank's grave?

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.080
 - Oh, it's lovely, isn't it?

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.600
 - Yeah, is that all folks?

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.680
 - Do the voice, please do the voice.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.520
 - That's all folks.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.640
 No, I can't do it, I can't do it.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.880
 - Lillie, lillie, lillie, lillie, that's all.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.720
 I can't do it, either.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.520
 - It's closer. - That was good.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.000
 - But do you know why it's on his grave?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.840
 - 'Cause he died.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.120
 - 'Cause he played porky pig and he died?

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.080
 - It's a, that's a good guess.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.520
 - That's all refers to his life's back.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.520
 - Yeah.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.040
 - Folks refers to the people who are reading the graves down.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.880
 - Yeah.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.720
 - Which will predominantly be humans.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.560
 - So you do understand the meaning of the phrase grave.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.760
 - I feel like we're missing something massive though, right?

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.080
 - Well, it was also his last words.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.640
 - What is it? - So actually the reason

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.560
 that his son decided to put it on the grave,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.520
 'cause a lot of people say it was in his will,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.160
 but I believe it's actually that he was filming a commercial

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.600
 for Buick Automobiles, and in that commercial,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.200
 they got him to say that's all folks, as you would,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.960
 if you had Mel Blank doing a commercial.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.400
 And they were his last words.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.880
 - He dropped dead right then.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.320
 - Well, he didn't drop dead, he collapsed.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.160
 So they were his last words.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.640
 - 'Cause they do the music, like da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.480
 - Yeah, they did it.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.840
 It was quite insensitive, actually.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.720
 His family sued afterwards.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.200
 - I don't think that counts as last words.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.120
 - What do you mean?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.200
 - Well, they're pre-written, they're not.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.600
 - But they were the last words he ever said.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.920
 - I know, but yeah, it's just--

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.760
 - Which I--

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.680
 - I know, that is quite, I think that counts.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.000
 - No, no, but it would be great if that was his final words.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.840
 - It would, just by chance.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.040
 - On his own, I'm at home, you know,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.520
 I'm dying on my bed.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.840
 I'm gonna go out with the porky pig line.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.840
 - My cat phrase, yeah.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.840
 - Well, I think that he probably did decide that,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.440
 'cause he actually lived for another few weeks,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.880
 but he didn't say anything else.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.360
 - I'm sorry, are you kidding yourself?

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.040
 If I was him, I would go, excuse me, excuse me,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.920
 can I have a glass of water, that's all folks?

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.640
 - Yeah, he's gonna make sure you keep going in.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.440
 Like, it was wasted the last few weeks of life,

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.760
 just not talking to anyone.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.440
 Imagine they were quality time you could have had

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.280
 with his family.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.760
 - All the things that were left unsaid,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.760
 because he didn't want to...

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.240
 - All right, guys, quite often,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.840
 people don't speak for weeks before they die, do they?

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.520
 'Cause they're in their own hospital unable to speak.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.920
 But I do like to think that he was lying there

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.840
 faking a coma, just so he could make sure.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.720
 Anyway, his son was like, well, they were his last words,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.080
 I'll put them on his gravestone.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.320
 - I saw an interview with his son,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.400
 and he said that the porky pig voice

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.680
 that he did was not a stutter.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.840
 He said that basically, Mel Blank once went to visit

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.840
 a pig farm to get into character

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.080
 to see what porky pig would be like.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.040
 And he saw the pig grunting in kind of a stuttering way,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.840
 and his porky pig voice was copying the pig's grunt.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.320
 It wasn't like a human stutter.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.000
 - It definitely doesn't sound like any

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.640
 sound or stutter I've ever heard.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.160
 - It also doesn't sound like any pig I've ever heard.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.880
 - No, it's closer to the stutter than it is the pig,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.120
 I would say. - Quite pretentious things

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.480
 where they're like, yeah, I spent like two weeks

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.600
 like studying pigs in order for my role as a cartoon pig.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.720
 But you didn't need to do that, mate.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.000
 Like it's a stupid cartoon, no one takes it that seriously.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.360
 - Wow, they did take it quite seriously, didn't they?

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.400
 I mean, they won Oscars, not necessarily for porky pig,

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.520
 but for these cartoons.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.080
 - Did you read about the famous blooper reel of porky pig?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.560
 So this was 1938, and this was put together on purpose

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.920
 'cause you can't have bloopers in cartoons.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.160
 - It's like at the end of Toy Story 2.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.320
 - Exactly where they do all that.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.920
 Yeah, so back in 1938, they were ready were doing this.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.600
 And so it's a video of porky where he smacks his thumb

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.480
 with a hammer, he goes in pain, and he says,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.480
 oh, son of a gun, which was the stuttering trick

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.120
 of porky pig, he would always not finish the word

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.520
 and put a new word in, but then he turns to the camera

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.640
 and says directly to the viewers, ha ha ha,

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.960
 you thought I was gonna say, son of a bitch.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.000
 And he does say it, and yeah.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.320
 - Scandal. - 'Cause at the end of the show,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.520
 his catchphrase, he says, at the V 'cause he's trying

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.840
 to say the end, and then he says,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.360
 that's all folks instead of the end.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.200
 - Did not know that.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.040
 - I think that's what it is.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.160
 - Really? - Yeah, I think so, yeah.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.320
 - Yeah, that sounds like it, yeah, I'm interested.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.400
 - And then they made that in 1938,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.800
 but it didn't get shown until the '90s, didn't it?

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.640
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.360
 - Because you couldn't show it in 1938.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.480
 - What, the word bitch?

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.080
 - Well, no, you couldn't say bitch in 1938,

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.840
 'cause like, obviously, frankly, my dear,

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.760
 I don't give a damn, was '39, wasn't it?

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.600
 So, yeah.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.760
 - And it was a corporate thing,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.360
 so they were doing it as a behind the scenes,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.560
 as a package of bloopers, they just put that in as a joke.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.400
 - Yeah, and then when they had the 50th anniversary

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.220
 of Warner Brothers, that's when it came out

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.480
 with a load of other bloopers.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.200
 - So how annoyed do you think they would have been

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.720
 the animators at the time when some dickhead said,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.280
 "Look, we're gonna make this blooper thing,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.440
 "it's gonna take you about two weeks

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.160
 "for a particular story, and it's not to be released ever."

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.280
 Just a funny little in-joke for nobody.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.440
 - But I feel like around that time,

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.480
 during that sort of golden age of animation,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.920
 and during all the Disney Studios things,

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.400
 loads of incredible workmanship went into stuff like that,

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.680
 that was just for internal use,

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.640
 or they would put details in the designs of stuff

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.760
 that no one would ever notice,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.080
 just because they had, frankly, the money in the time,

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.720
 but also the passion and the craftsmanship,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.360
 and they were really into what they did,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.200
 which is quite nice.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.920
 - Do you guys know how Pocky Pig got his name?

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.760
 - No.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.040
 - It seems like it's 'cause he was a pig,

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.320
 and then pigs produce pork, doesn't it?

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.440
 I don't like to do the old back at you.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.400
 - Do they produce pork?

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.120
 Like milk, or are they pork?

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.080
 (laughing)

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.920
 - They suck pork.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.240
 - They do produce pork.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.480
 - That is obviously part of the story.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.600
 - Was it the result of sort of

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.200
 six months brains drawing out a pig form

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.640
 by the writers and then massive?

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.320
 (laughing)

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.560
 - It's, again, from Fritz Rieling, who created him,

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.880
 and when he grew up, there were two brothers

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.760
 who grew up in his neighborhood.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.720
 One was called Pocky, and the other one was called Piggy.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.560
 (laughing)

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.400
 - No.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.600
 - Yeah, 'cause they were overweight children,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.520
 so they were kind of bullied with these names,

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.680
 and then he took the names and used them for his character.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.520
 - Really?

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.080
 - That's so weird that the most Piggy name for a pig

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.400
 actually came from people.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.240
 - Yeah?

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.080
 - 'Cause I would just think if you're porky and pig,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.560
 it's like pork and pig, the two piggy as well.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.280
 - That kind of says it is a very obvious thing

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.160
 to call a Piggy character.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.120
 - We think it's obvious now, but at the time,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.680
 it's mind-blowingly imaginative.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.600
 - Sorry, who was the name of the count that you said?

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.120
 - Count Cotelli.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.600
 - Yeah, that guy.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.800
 - It's C-U-T-E-L-L-I.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.360
 - It's kind of appropriate that he's Italian,

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.400
 because the origin of Porky Pig he was based on,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.240
 or inspired by, a staple character

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.480
 from traditional Italian comedy, the Comedia dell'arte.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.320
 - What was it?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.720
 - So like, from between like the 16th to 18th centuries,

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.400
 there was this traditional theater comedy

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.560
 and it used all of these staple comedy characters.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.600
 - Like the Harlequin?

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.320
 - The Harlequin was one, which is the servant.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.320
 And yeah, Porky Pig is based on the Tartaglia,

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.920
 which is Italian for stutterer,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.040
 and it's a far-sighted, dainty character

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.480
 with a stutter.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.320
 - Really?

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.640
 - Do you know who hated Porky Pig's stutter?

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.600
 - Daffy Duck.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.320
 - You're somebody sad, a roadrunner.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.360
 - Porky Pig himself.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.520
 - Yeah, there was an episode where he hears himself

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.240
 on a playback of an old tune of old McDonald Had a Farm,

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.480
 and he hates the stutter so much,

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.960
 that he smashes both the record and the playback machine.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.800
 And I read this in an academic paper,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.720
 which is called The Clinical Study of Porky Pig Cartoons.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.680
 And it's by Gerald F. Johnson.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.000
 And basically this was a paper that was trying to show,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.720
 did it have a positive or negative influence

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.560
 to have a character that had a stutter like Porky Pig?

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.280
 Because Porky Pig had jobs such as a farmer,

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.440
 a gas station attendant.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.280
 - A farmer?

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.120
 That's a bit dark.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:29.960
 - It is, yeah.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.280
 (laughing)

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.600
 - Well, maybe it was horrible.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.680
 - Oh, right, okay, yeah.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.840
 - He was a railroad engineer, a pilot, a private,

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.240
 in the French foreign legion, a newscaster.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.400
 So he sort of makes the point that any kids

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.320
 that were watching it could see

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.560
 that they could do multiple jobs.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.440
 - Well, this suggests me that he can't hold down a job.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.200
 (laughing)

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.040
 - That's very true.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.360
 - That's a worrying CV.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.200
 - Yeah.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.440
 - But you know, I was just looking up treatments

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.040
 for stutters throughout history.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.320
 And in the 19th century, there were obviously

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.000
 shed loads of quacks suggesting you kind of like

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.360
 cut your tongue in half or you slit that bit

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.240
 under the bottom of your tongue or you shrink your tongue

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.080
 by having it cut to, you know, lots of stuff

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.680
 which never worked, so you're amazed how long it lasted.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.880
 But one of the leading quacks/doctors

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.720
 who promoted stuttering cures was this guy

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.440
 who went around Europe and actually was really important

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.360
 in developing like welfare systems in Europe

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.360
 because he went to the governments of places

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.240
 like the Netherlands and Prussia and Belgium

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.920
 and said, "I want you to implement my stuttering cure,"

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.320
 which he'd actually bought from a woman called Widow Lee.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.280
 But anyway, his name was Mr. Malibush,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.960
 which means bad mouth.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.800
 - Wow.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.640
 - Dun dun dun.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.040
 I thought that was quite cool, amazing.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:38.880
 - Yeah.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.600
 - It's interesting that 80% of adults

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.160
 who stutter are male, way more men stutter women.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.920
 And apparently they've done some like studies

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.120
 and brain scans and the way that your speech patterns work

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.680
 is just different between men and women when you stutter.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.520
 - Really?

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.360
 - It's weird.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.440
 - Yeah, I think it's fully understood, but...

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.600
 - There was a theory in the early 20th century

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.600
 that eating too many vegetables caused stuttering vegetarianism.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.960
 And there was a psychologist called Knight Dunlap

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.200
 who also founded the Journal of Psychology.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.000
 So he wasn't a proper quack,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.960
 but he thought that if someone stuttered,

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.280
 maybe you should give them a diet of meat

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.120
 and that would cure them.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.960
 - Pork?

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.520
 (laughing)

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.520
 - So when was that, sorry?

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.920
 - That was early 20th century.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.560
 - Okay, so like during the war,

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.520
 you had to really get the amount of carrots you ate right

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.760
 for like good eyesight, but not bad speech.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.080
 - Oh yeah, that's true.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.760
 And also speaking of Mel Blanc, he never ate carrots, did he?

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.600
 - Did he not?

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.840
 - No, there's a famous thing,

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.280
 like there's a thing online that he was allergic to carrots

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.400
 which we think is not true, right?

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.240
 - Okay.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.720
 - Yeah, it's not true, but do you know where it comes from?

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.680
 The fact that people think he's allergic, it's because,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.840
 and it does actually make perfect sense.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.360
 So as Bugs Bunny, they experimented with lots of sound effects

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.120
 for how you can generate the sound of eating a carrot.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.560
 And they realized that only thing that generates

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.480
 the sound of eating a carrot is eating a carrot.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.320
 - Did they not have the big noise?

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.880
 (laughing)

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.840
 - The one thing he can't do is one weakness.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.640
 - Every time the big noise ate a carrot,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.000
 it was completely silent.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.120
 (laughing)

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.960
 - It was so weird.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.520
 - It just sounds like a car going past, didn't it?

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.440
 - Famously sucked his carrots like a lolly.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.240
 So they couldn't use him.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.960
 And so Mel Blanc realized he just had to eat carrots

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.960
 in order to get the sound effect.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.440
 But once you're swallowing carrot,

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.800
 then you can't say your line.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.280
 So he'd have a spittoon and he just had to chew a carrot

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.560
 and then spit it out in order to then say his line.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.880
 And from there, develop the idea that,

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.880
 oh, he's allergic to carrots

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.320
 'cause he was always spitting carrots out.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.320
 - I would have just got a runner in

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.160
 to eat the carrots in the microwave.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.480
 - I know, could they not hire a carrot eater?

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.600
 - Especially if you can't talk and eat carrots, yeah.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.940
 - That would be the most awesome job, wouldn't it?

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.640
 I'm a carrot eater for Mel Blanc.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.220
 (upbeat music)

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:44.080
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Alex.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.240
 My fact this week is that in the 1950s,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.780
 you could catch a bus from London to Calcutta.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.960
 - Okay.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.320
 - You did have to book, you couldn't just like tap, tap in.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.160
 - Yeah.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.000
 - I think, I don't think it's outside the office.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.960
 - Yeah, they didn't have an oyster zone in Calcutta.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.200
 - Where was the longest stretch

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.000
 where if you missed your stop?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.840
 (laughing)

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.280
 - Are you frantically pressing the bell?

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.760
 (laughing)

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.680
 So this is a bus service that ran from 1957 until 1976.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.480
 You could get single tickets or return tickets,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.780
 which I thought was quite weird

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.480
 because you could take a bus to India

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.560
 and then just be stuck there.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.640
 - Which lots of people did.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.680
 - Yeah, yeah, that's true.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.120
 It was 85 pounds for a single,

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.380
 which I think is about two and a half thousand pounds today.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.520
 But it's more of a package holiday,

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.640
 including travel and food and accommodation.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.040
 And it was another 65 pounds if you wanted to come back again.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.960
 - Okay, 'cause often a return ticket these days

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.680
 is like two pounds more if you get a train.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.400
 - Yeah, no, no, this is almost double, yeah.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.720
 - Could you get like that thing

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.720
 where you split your tickets

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.360
 between all the different places?

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.680
 - Yeah, split there.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.080
 - No, no, none of the complicated.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.120
 - God, we've come a long way haven't we?

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.560
 - Yeah, but we can't go to India anymore on a bus, so.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.440
 - Right, if your bus is 15 minutes late

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.360
 to the next destination,

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.160
 can you reclaim all of the money?

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.520
 - That would be great.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.680
 So this bus was equipped with beds and a kitchen

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.440
 and heaters and a music system for parties, apparently.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.920
 And also something called reading facilities,

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.000
 which I don't know what that is, like a chair.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.040
 - Like a library, I guess, like a bookshelf.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.880
 - Sounds like a movie bookshelf.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.800
 - It sounds like a Spice World bus.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.640
 - It does.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.640
 - It sounds like a lot of fun.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.840
 - So this specific first service was called The India Man

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.200
 and it was run by a guy called Oswald Joseph Garrow Fisher,

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.840
 which is, I've never heard of someone

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.240
 who has a double barreled first name and last name.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.840
 - Do you know that he was known?

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.600
 Everyone called him Paddy.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.640
 I was reading an article from the Buffalo Career Express

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.920
 from the time and it said, obviously, again, of its time,

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.240
 it said Garrow Fisher, who is better known as Paddy

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.560
 because he is Irish.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.800
 - I mean, it is easier to say than Oswald Joseph Garrow Fisher.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.280
 - His name with all those hyphens actually would look like

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.960
 a confusingly like the destination.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.400
 - It does, yeah, because on the outside,

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.720
 it did say London, Kakata London on the bus,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.040
 which I think was quite cool because it is a loop trip.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.680
 And the bus went from London.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.800
 It was a 10,000 mile journey

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.840
 on what became known as the hippie route.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.560
 So it went via Belgium,

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.480
 what was then Yugoslavia to Northwestern India.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.480
 - And up through places today that you couldn't go through.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.880
 - I guess it must have gone through.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.160
 If it's gone through the Yugoslavia,

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.680
 it must have gone through Turkey and then like Iran.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.760
 - Iran, Pakistan.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.760
 - It started a big phenomenon of bus journeys

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.880
 all around the world and this route became quite popular,

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.560
 but it ended because of-

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.640
 - It was the Iranian Revolution, isn't it?

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.960
 - Exactly, yeah, the wars.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.800
 - And a lot of my parents were not a lot.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.120
 A few of my parents' friends have done it.

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.960
 It was the gap year of its day, wasn't it?

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.240
 And they do talk about how different it was then

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.960
 that you could go through all of these countries.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.200
 And I know it was Cold War, so it was, you know,

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.800
 not a bed of roses,

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.600
 but now you would be told it was too dangerous

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.760
 to get a bus through any of those places.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.800
 And then you just went through

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.080
 and we met with friendly receptions in all those countries,

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.240
 but didn't they think they'd got murdered at one point?

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.920
 - Yeah, so on the way there,

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.400
 he writes all about the cliffs around Mount Ararat

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.280
 and like going through these crazy like hairpin bends.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.120
 In Iran, they had to put wooden planks under the wheels

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.160
 because the bus was sinking into the sand.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.480
 It had to be dug out of a bog in Persia.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.440
 It was sandstorms and rains and incredible heat

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.720
 and collapsed bridges and like a crash.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.720
 Like, I mean, it sounds like a ridiculous journey.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.760
 And there's some amazing pictures you can see online as well.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.040
 And yeah, on the return trip,

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.320
 they were massively delayed by like, I think a month

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.640
 because of an outbreak of Asian influenza,

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.840
 so they had to take a massive detour.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.280
 And that prompted a rumour

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.000
 that they'd been kidnapped and murdered by bandits.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.440
 And I think the British Embassy in Tehran thought of that

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.760
 and were so relieved that they like had a cocktail party

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.320
 for them when they got there.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.360
 - I read that definitely they had the cocktail party.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.600
 I read that at the time in the newspapers,

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.000
 but I couldn't find any evidence in the newspapers

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.680
 that people thought they had been.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.840
 - I think it was a story, 'cause Garry Fisher said it,

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.360
 and I think it was a bit of a,

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.560
 hey, they thought we'd been killed,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.680
 so they were so happy to see us, probably a throwaway.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.160
 Did they think you'd been killed line

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.760
 or did they just have some cocktails going there?

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.280
 It's an embassy, they're always cocktails.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.120
 - They do have every bus that comes in.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.360
 - Exactly, we got invited to an embassy once

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.600
 just for being in town, didn't we?

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.520
 - Well, I thought they thought we'd been murdered.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.720
 - But yeah, 50 days, they were 50 days delayed back,

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.960
 which is, I mean, oh, I feel sorry

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.760
 for the people waiting at the bus stop.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.920
 - And then three came along at once.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.120
 - I can't do three minutes on a Jubilee line.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.400
 - And they were called Freaks,

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.240
 weren't they?

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.080
 They called themselves Freaks, the hippie trailers.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.080
 And there's still a street called Freak Street in Kathmandu,

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.280
 which was sort of like famously the kind of center

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.840
 of where all the hippies sort of ended up, hung out,

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.320
 built lots of communities.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.400
 Yeah, so they're still Freak Street,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.520
 and it inspired Lonely Planet, the hippie trail.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.040
 So Maureen and Tony Wheeler, they did the hippie trail,

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.440
 and then they thought, "This is fun, we'll write about it."

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.560
 They messed up the name.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.920
 They listened to a song

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.680
 and thought it referred to Lonely Planet.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.880
 It was a song called Space Captain by Joe Cocker,

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.120
 and it actually referred to Lovely Planet,

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.360
 which makes more sense.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.200
 They should have called it.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.080
 - Lonely Planet is actually quite a sad title

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:51.920
 for a traveling book.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.080
 It doesn't really inspire offensive thought.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.560
 - It is for people who travel on their own,

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.400
 isn't it Lonely Planet?

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.480
 Or it was originally, I think.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.560
 - Maybe it was originally.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.760
 - That's what I would have assumed.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.320
 But don't, like, I'm single,

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.760
 I buy all products as single people.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.720
 - Don't put the word Lonely in the branding.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.880
 - So you go to the saves,

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.560
 reason you get a lonely meal for one.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.080
 - We know Wendy's meal for one, right?

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.000
 She's like, "Oh, thank you."

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.200
 - "Sad, she's good."

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.280
 - "What do you think I've got?"

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.240
 - This is my dialon single bed.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.640
 - Some stuff on buses.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.480
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.320
 - Here's the thing.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.120
 Who was the first person to ever be thrown under the bus?

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.960
 - Oh.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.800
 - You know, this is like a cut.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.800
 If you watch the traitors and stuff these days,

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.800
 everyone's saying, "Oh, I threw them under the bus,"

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.640
 "oh, they're gonna throw me under the bus."

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.960
 - Is it gonna be like a Roman, like,

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.120
 thrown under the chariot?

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.320
 - Wait, so are there two possible answers here?

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.880
 One of, someone was thrown under a bus physically,

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.280
 but then someone used the term for the first time later?

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.120
 Or the two combined?

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.760
 - Okay, so my question to you is the term

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.560
 to be thrown under the bus.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.600
 Who was the first person that that term was used about?

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.160
 Not who was literally thrown under the bus.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.440
 It's all metaphorical.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.160
 - Was it connected to buses in any way, though?

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.680
 Was it totally detached from what they were doing?

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.520
 - Totally detached.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.720
 - Is this guessable?

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.600
 - In my experience, with the QI stuff,

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.560
 it's either gonna be Stone Age, or it's gonna be 1800s,

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.400
 but never again.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.400
 - Okay, it's neither of those things.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.680
 It's guessable because it's one of the most famous people

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.520
 in British history.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.840
 - Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.760
 Who was betrayed?

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.600
 - Keep going.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.440
 - Who was betrayed?

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.760
 Come on, let's think of someone famously betrayed.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.600
 - Thatcher.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.440
 - Correct!

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.280
 - Thatcher.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.520
 - Alex is just a listing famous people.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.240
 - Name conservative MPs and stuff.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.840
 - I hate people who play 20 questions like that.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.960
 Don't use all your guesses on names.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.880
 (laughing)

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.960
 You got lucky this time.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.520
 - So this was, basically,

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.440
 if you wanted to get rid of a politician,

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.040
 you would say, what if they fell under a bus?

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:33.880
 - Right.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.720
 - Do you know what I mean?

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.560
 - We can't get rid of them any other way.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.400
 - Maybe with a little accident.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.840
 - Yeah, we can't get rid of them any other way.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.180
 What if they fell under the bus?

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.840
 Then maybe we'll get a new leader kind of thing.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.160
 So that was a saying.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.640
 But during the early 1980s,

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.560
 when the Falkland Island invasion happened,

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:53.320
 someone in the UK said President Galtieri of Argentina

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:57.200
 pushed her, meaning Margaret Thatcher, under the bus,

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.640
 which the Gossips had said was the only means of her removal.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.240
 So it was, falling under a bus was always a thing,

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.920
 but this was the first time someone was

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.600
 metaphorically pushed under a bus.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.680
 - Oh, really?

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.520
 Wow.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.120
 A lot of people threw her under the bus, didn't they?

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.520
 I'd never thought of Galtieri as being the main guy.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.120
 - This, well, she did last quite a long time after that.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:16.960
 (laughing)

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.800
 And actually, the Falklands law didn't really do

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.160
 her any damage at all.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.560
 They almost threw her into the driving seat of the bus.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.520
 - I would say so, yeah, rather the opposite.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.760
 - They threw her into that best seat on the top deck,

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.200
 where it looks like you're driving.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.720
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, and that is a good seat.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.840
 - Yeah, but you don't have enough leg room,

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.120
 so swing them around a bit.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.200
 Okay, just me who complains about that.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.280
 (laughing)

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.680
 Never mind.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.480
 Do you know there's a bus route in London

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.480
 between West Ealing and West Rye Slip,

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.280
 which is about a 20, 25 minute journey.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.480
 And it goes once a week on Wednesdays at 11, 17

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.680
 in the morning, and no one gets it.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.880
 - It's purely for throwing politicians under.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.000
 Those two places are very close,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.360
 relatively close to each other.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.200
 - Yes.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.400
 - And I can't think of any reason

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.280
 why I would ever want to go between the two of them.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.120
 - I think, you know--

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:03.960
 - Is it a ghost bus?

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.800
 Is it real?

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.640
 Is it a ghost bus?

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.600
 - There you go, it is a ghost bus,

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.680
 and people of West Ealing or West Rye Slip

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.600
 who have friends in the other,

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.520
 please write to James complaining about,

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.520
 you know, why you might want to.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.160
 - Oh, yeah, I'll wait for the flood of e-bells to come in.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.000
 - I'm gonna go ride it.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.120
 I love riding a ghost bus.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.320
 - Yeah, well, it's the kind of thing

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.400
 that people like you do ride.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.240
 I think--

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.240
 - Let's try to get a little less contempt.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.960
 - I can only get singles tickets,

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.960
 because no one has a ticket.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.800
 (laughing)

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.640
 - Fuck you.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.440
 - It is a ghost bus, though, you're right.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.280
 And it's related to ghost trains,

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.120
 which I actually don't think

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.280
 we've ever mentioned on this podcast,

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.960
 but ghost trains are train routes that are kept open,

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.240
 even though no one gets them,

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.200
 because it's actually bureaucratically really expensive

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.480
 to shut down a specific route.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.720
 So there are various routes in the UK, 30 or so,

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.320
 where no one gets this train route,

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.760
 but the train still runs.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.040
 So that, you know, if you wanted to reopen it properly,

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.560
 then it's still open.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.680
 - But there's more reasons to keep a ghost train,

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.760
 'cause it maintains the track and keeps everything running

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.720
 and keeps your train in good order.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.760
 Whereas a ghost bus,

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.960
 you just use the bus somewhere else

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.160
 and what's the reason for it?

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.200
 - Well, because this used to be a train route

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.240
 and no one was getting it.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.560
 - Was it just driving on the train tracks?

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.840
 - No, it's not driving on the train tracks,

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.880
 if you will hear me out.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.480
 - Sorry, sorry.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.600
 - It used to be a rail route.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.760
 The rail route no longer exists,

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.920
 so it is a bus replacement service.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.400
 So this is called a bus replacement service.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.720
 - A permanent bus replacement service.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.960
 - For a rail that doesn't exist anymore,

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.800
 and it's because it's bureaucratically too expensive

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.840
 to cancel the rail route.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.760
 - Can I ask, why did they remove the rail route

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.360
 when so many people want to go

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:31.000
 for West Rhyslip to Ealing or whatever it was?

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.640
 - All right, there's only one person,

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.880
 but they made that trip all the time.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.240
 - Do you reckon they'll continue downgrading it

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.040
 and then eventually they'll just be like a skateboard?

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.880
 - Yeah.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.040
 - If you want to, it's technically a DFL service.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.520
 We're talking about a rail replacement bus service.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.960
 Have you heard of a bus replacement rail service?

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.600
 - Bus replacement.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.600
 I haven't, but I get it and it feels plausible.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.840
 - So in 2016, there were two villages in Scotland,

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.280
 one at Ked and Lead Hills, and they're in South Lanarkshire,

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.840
 and the road connection then was closed

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.440
 for resurfacing for a week.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.920
 But this was a bit of an issue for people

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.560
 who live there, a lot of elderly people,

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.720
 there's a doctor's surgery in one,

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.560
 and shops in the other,

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.840
 and then he's get one to the other.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.280
 And there was a 45-mile diversion,

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.120
 if you want to drive around,

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.920
 so it wasn't really workable for all these people.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.360
 So there was a small volunteer-run railway line

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.280
 that goes between the two,

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.640
 and it's just a tourist attraction.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.000
 So the authorities decided to turn it

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.160
 into an official service

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.760
 that you could actually travel between.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.360
 - With the two old grannies who do the heritage tickets

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.440
 and they're all typewriter,

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.240
 having to print out just hundreds of days.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.880
 - Thousands and thousands of commuters

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.120
 every morning are coming in.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:31.960
 - Absolutely.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.440
 - And it's, I think, the only one of its kind.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.280
 - Very cool.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.120
 - I've heard of that.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:35.960
 - That is very cool.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.280
 - In 2015, there was a tweet that went viral

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.240
 for revealing that there was a bus service

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.880
 that went to Woking.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.560
 And do you know what number it was?

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.960
 What number bus you'd get to Woking?

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.800
 - 69.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.640
 - I'm sorry.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.480
 - No, I don't know.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.320
 (laughing)

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.560
 - Oh, 95, working 95.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.400
 - Nine.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.240
 - Yeah.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.080
 - Oh.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:54.920
 - Nine to five.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.360
 - Because I went through Woking on a train once,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.600
 and I saw the word Woking,

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.040
 and I was just thinking, oh, Woking, nine to five.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.560
 And then I looked at my watch,

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.240
 and it was eight to five in the morning,

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.520
 'cause I was going somewhere in the morning.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.360
 - Oh, okay.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.040
 - So I was like working five to nine close enough

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:07.880
 and tweeted it.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.720
 - It's not close enough.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.560
 - It's not close enough.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.400
 - It has to be exact.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.000
 - Woking five to nine is kind of funny.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.840
 Like it's funny enough.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.000
 - Oh yeah, five to, yeah, okay.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.400
 - Didn't you want to say a successful tweet?

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.240
 - No, it did not.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.880
 - Okay, so yeah, there was a bus service called 925.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.080
 This guy tweeted it back in 2015,

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.920
 except after getting however many retweets and likes,

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.320
 turned out that he had photoshopped it,

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.280
 that it didn't exist,

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.600
 that it was in fact the 701.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.120
 So this bus didn't exist.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.360
 However, the people who ran the bus service

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.560
 loved it so much that a few years later,

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.000
 they did change it to the 925.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.080
 So the joke became a real thing.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.120
 But here's what's interesting.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.280
 - Oh my, sorry, my story was less good,

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.400
 but at least it was true.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.080
 (laughing)

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.880
 - This guy made a joke, which then got turned true,

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.200
 which is pretty incredible.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.040
 - He lied, he lied.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.240
 - Okay, wow.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.040
 - Could I quickly do one more thing about going to India?

00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:58.880
 - Yeah.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.600
 - So there's a book called "Husband Hunting in the Raj"

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.960
 by Anna Corsi.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.680
 And she's writing about how lots of women

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.120
 in the late 19th century would go to India

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.440
 to look for a husband.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.440
 And that's because the Indian civil service

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.440
 insisted that all its male staff

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.920
 remained bachelors until the age of 30.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.640
 And in those days, if you're a woman

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.840
 and you were not married by the time

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.160
 you were in your mid to late 20s, then you were--

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.000
 - A lonely woman.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.280
 - You were a lonely woman, yeah, exactly.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.200
 And so apparently there was this sort of big influx

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.560
 of British women who every year

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.600
 would just all go to India to find a husband.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.440
 - Wow.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.800
 - Snap out of those single civil servants.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.640
 - This is amazing.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.240
 And there was loads of like pamphlets and books

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.200
 that people would write to tell you what to do

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.760
 if you're a woman going to India.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.520
 There was one, a few words of advice on traveling

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.240
 to ladies by a guy called HMLS, we don't know who it was,

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.240
 who said, "Choose a simple dress of soft warm tweed

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.880
 of that gray color.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.840
 It is also a good plan to use very old underclothing

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.520
 such as can be thrown away when soiled."

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.840
 - Excuse me?

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.680
 - That is a good--

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.040
 - Is that about the curries?

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.040
 - It doesn't, there's no information.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.200
 - I reckon that's about the curries.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.600
 - No, you're on a long pass.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.840
 - You know laundry, so they're like,

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.680
 don't waste your good stuff

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.520
 'cause you're gonna have to chuck it.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.000
 - This isn't a bust to say this would be

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.960
 on a steamliner or something.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.800
 - Oh, okay, right.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.800
 - But I mean, it's all very long journey.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.480
 - These poor men, all these women turning up

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.480
 being like, "I'm not wearing anything under this tweed."

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.240
 (all laughing)

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.700
 - It was when we set up.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:28.800
 (all laughing)

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.800
 - It's in this plastic bag.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.560
 (all laughing)

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.800
 - I'm just gonna tie it to this tree.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.640
 - Yeah.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.760
 - This poor town half way to India,

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.920
 they just got piles of dirty women's laundry.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.880
 Things, like, splited.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.460
 (upbeat music)

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:47.280
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.160
 and that is James.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.640
 - Okay, my fact this week is that hockey masks

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.800
 were invented thanks to chronic sinusitis.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.760
 - Well, there is only one pewed tissue

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.200
 just around the nose.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.120
 - Exactly, no, this is something that strikes home to me

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.760
 because I am a very keen hockey player.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.760
 No, I suffer from sinusitis quite a lot.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.600
 So, I'm really glad that some good has come out of it.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.200
 (all laughing)

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.200
 And this is the hockey mask.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.160
 And when I say hockey mask,

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.980
 one, I'm talking about ice hockey.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.600
 Two, I'm talking about the mask

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.240
 that a gold tender would wear.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.080
 - Yep.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.200
 - So, you know, it's not the helmet that everybody--

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.320
 - It's the Halloween film.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.140
 - Yeah, Jason.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.680
 - Jason Voorhees' one, yeah, exactly.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.320
 - Who suffered from chronic sinusitis?

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.160
 - Yes.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.000
 (all laughing)

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:32.840
 - Which is why he was so angry.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.680
 - So angry.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.520
 (all laughing)

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.360
 - But he never said anything.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.200
 He was like, "Pffft!"

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.280
 (all laughing)

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.760
 - So, this was a guy called Jacques Plant,

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.780
 or Jacques Plant, or Jacques Planté.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.400
 (all laughing)

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.360
 Or Chante, Je m'appelle Jacques Planté.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:54.760
 And he had terrible sinusitis,

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.320
 and he had an operation.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.720
 And after he had the operation,

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.300
 he had to keep his nose intact,

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.680
 but he still wanted to play hockey.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.520
 And so, he wore a mask to stop the puck

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.360
 from hitting him in the face.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.000
 His coach, who's called Toe Blake,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.320
 his first name was Toe.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.680
 (all laughing)

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.040
 That's in the bit at the end of your foot.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.320
 He wasn't very happy about it,

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.600
 but he said, "Okay, well, you know,

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.840
 "I need you on the team, whatever."

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.680
 As long as you take it off

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.280
 when your sinusitis gets better, then it's fine.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.560
 - And when, this was the '50s?

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.760
 - Oh, yes, I should say this was the late '50s.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.160
 And then, later on, he was hitting the face with a puck,

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.080
 and he went off and came back with a mask again.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:32.920
 - Mid-game, yeah.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.800
 - Mid-game.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.240
 And then, they went on a massive winning streak.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.720
 And so, the manager said, "Okay, fine.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.440
 "Like, this is obviously working."

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.920
 And then, all the other goaltenders saw this as a good idea,

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.040
 and it just became everywhere.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.000
 - And he really defied Toe Blake's wishes,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.600
 because Toe was like,

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.440
 - Yeah, he was a dick about it.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.960
 - "You get that mask out of here."

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.720
 And he was like, "No, I'm going on with the mask,

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.320
 "or I'm not going on at all."

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.160
 And he was in there--

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.040
 - He was entirely fair, like, with a broken nose,

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.840
 like, hitting the puck in the face with a puck.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.320
 - Yeah, and it's not the first time

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.280
 anyone's ever gone on with a mask.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.120
 - No.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.760
 - It happened, you know, sporadically throughout the years,

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.640
 because people had had their face busted up.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.560
 But Plant, Planty,

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.240
 he's the one who said, "No, I'm wearing it,

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.000
 "and I'm going to wear it again, and again, and again."

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.440
 And then, slowly changed the culture of ice hockey.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.280
 - Yeah.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.120
 - Game by game.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.360
 - He gave the finger to Toe.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.760
 (laughing)

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.600
 - He sure did.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.920
 - I haven't said anything for three minutes.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.200
 (laughing)

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.120
 - Do you know why Toe Blake was called Toe Blake?

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.200
 - Well, because both of his parents were also called Blake.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.040
 (laughing)

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:34.880
 - Yes.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.240
 - And by tradition, you keep the surname.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.080
 - He's bang on, guys.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.440
 - Was it a family name?

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.840
 Were there five or four other Toes?

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.240
 - Did he have one enormous Toe?

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.760
 - No, I'll give you, it was a Toe.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.600
 (laughing)

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.440
 I'm like, like, inspired kids.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.280
 He was.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.120
 (laughing)

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.560
 He wanted to, yeah,

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.240
 they wanted to donate his Toe to science afterwards.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.320
 It was so prominent.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.400
 A clue, Buzz Aldrin.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.240
 - Oh.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.080
 - Oh, he left his Toe on the moon.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.680
 He gave his Toe to Buzz Aldrin.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.120
 - It was a small Toe for them.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.880
 (laughing)

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.760
 - Okay, so Buzz Aldrin got his name

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.680
 because his sister said his,

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.520
 - Yes.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.360
 - Called him Buzz.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.200
 - Called him Buzz.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.040
 So his real name is Hector,

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.720
 but his little sister,

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.240
 heck Toe, heck Toe, Toe, Toe is where it's stuck.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.200
 But what he was known as within the ice hockey world was,

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.400
 - Head, shoulders, knees up.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.440
 (laughing)

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.640
 - Who would have thought you'd get two

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.760
 head, shoulders, knees and toes to get into one book of?

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.920
 - No, he was known as the old lamplighter.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.200
 - Really?

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.040
 - And he's amazing.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.080
 - And what, so why?

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.120
 - He's been listed as one of the 100 greatest

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.480
 NHL players in history.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.320
 - Sure.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.720
 - The old lamplighter because he's so good at scoring goals

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.040
 that a light goes on when you score a goal.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:42.880
 - Oh, of course.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.920
 - To let you know he's the old lamplighter.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.760
 - Oh, that's good.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.600
 - Yeah, that's very nice.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.880
 - So the first actual example of anyone wearing a mask

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.880
 that we know of was a woman called Elizabeth Graham

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:57.880
 of Queens University who in 1927 wore a fencing mask.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.960
 And according to her son, she had done it

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.000
 'cause she'd recently had dental work

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.200
 and she wanted to protect her teeth.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.760
 - There does seem to be a vanity element

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.960
 to the original masks 'cause there's her

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.360
 who didn't wanna damage more of her teeth

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.700
 or get more dental bills.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.080
 - So it goes a little bit beyond vanity.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.640
 So I don't want my teeth smashed up.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.720
 - Yeah, that's very nice.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.560
 - It's a hard puck.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.400
 - I'm sorry, pucks.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.240
 - They trashed it your face.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.680
 - 160 kilometers an hour.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.320
 I don't think it's like, oh, you're absolutely worse.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.680
 You want a mask in your face.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.200
 I just think they're so mean back in the day.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.040
 - No, but it was, I think she specifically said

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.560
 that she was trying to save her dad the dental bills.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.080
 But that's probably because she was too afraid

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.360
 to just say, I'm really scared of being

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.200
 wiped in the face with a puck.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.440
 But also there was a guy called Jack Crawford

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.040
 who was one of the first people to wear a helmet

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.720
 in italki and that was in the 1930s.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.280
 And he wore it apparently 'cause he was bald

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.640
 and he just wanted to conceal his bald patch.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.480
 - That's so funny.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.480
 - That's so great.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.880
 - That's rotating a vanity.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.680
 - Yeah, yeah, that's more a vanity thing.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.520
 You're absolutely right.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.120
 - I wouldn't put the vanity on the only woman

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.440
 that we have in this question.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.520
 - I'm allowed to do whatever I like

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.840
 with the only woman in the question, Alex.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.480
 - Do you know that when actually speaking of women in hockey,

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.160
 when international women's hockey

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.120
 first became a big thing, and this was in the 1980s,

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.040
 a lot of the leagues required breast protectors.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.360
 So you had to wear something solid over your breast

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.480
 so that they don't get hit by the puck.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.400
 But one of the problems that they had in,

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.160
 I think it was in Sweden, is that one of the referees

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.600
 refused to check if the players were wearing them.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.240
 So they couldn't enforce the law

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.520
 'cause it was a male referee

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.880
 and he wouldn't go in and just prod and go.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.240
 (laughing)

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.360
 - Are they just very hard breasts?

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.840
 Are you wearing a protector?

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.000
 - That's a weird job, isn't it?

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.480
 Like, what do you do, like,

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.360
 to grope women before games?

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.800
 - I started as the carrot eater from Melbourne.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.880
 (laughing)

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.160
 - Well, we're on referees.

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.960
 Has anyone heard of Frederick Charles Albert Waghorn,

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.040
 AKA the old wag?

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.800
 (laughing)

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.600
 - He had a tail?

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.240
 - No, he's quite an innovative hockey referee.

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.520
 He's set a lot of rules.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.840
 One of the biggest things that he did

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.160
 was referees didn't used to have a whistle.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.640
 Instead of a whistle, do you know what they had?

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.000
 They had a cowbell.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.640
 - That makes sense.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.040
 'Cause it's like an alpine, I don't know, like mountainous.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.360
 - 'Cause you have cowbells into nose sometimes?

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.560
 - Yeah, I know, I'm not really going anywhere with that.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.400
 (laughing)

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.480
 - The problem was, is that people kept turning up

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.040
 with their own cowbells.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.680
 So you had people making it so that plays

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.520
 couldn't happen.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.600
 - So what they did is they used something

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.080
 that no one else could possibly get a hold of, a whistle.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.960
 - Exactly, now this is what's so amazing.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.680
 - It's impossible that the audience was just cows.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.240
 (laughing)

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.360
 - But this is what's amazing about the old wag's decision

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.320
 is that there wasn't, at the time,

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.560
 a thing of you having a whistle.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.120
 Whistles weren't, like, we're living in a time

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.600
 where whistles weren't that commercial.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.400
 - You're right, because at the start of the 20th century,

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.440
 everyone used to carry a cowbell around.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.280
 (laughing)

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.120
 - Exactly, and the cowbells were big.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.480
 - There was a lot more farming going on, maybe.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.480
 That was more accessible.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.800
 - Yeah, no one really had them.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.720
 So you were more likely to have a cowbell

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.000
 come to a hockey match than you were a whistle.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.840
 This is true.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.640
 And so he introduced the whistle.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.120
 He introduced professional referees in amateur hockey games.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.360
 The practice of dropping the puck from a few feet high

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.200
 when you're going for the at the start, he did that.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.840
 And he also said you can't count it as a goal

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.960
 if the puck breaks in half and half the puck

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:17.960
 goes inside the net.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.840
 You need the full puck going inside the net.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.120
 I guess maybe back in the day,

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.040
 the materials were different and it did happen.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.200
 But here's the thing about the whistle.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.440
 He took it from being, not only introduced it,

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.240
 but took it from being a steel whistle

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.640
 to a plastic whistle,

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.480
 because referees kept getting their lips stuck around it

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.480
 in the ice cold.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.320
 - It's so cold.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.160
 - Yeah, it goes to whistling.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.000
 What's wrong?

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.840
 (whistling)

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.080
 (laughing)

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.280
 - That's so funny.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:47.600
 - Something else that hockey masks have given us.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.720
 The world record for the farthest eyeball pop.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.560
 I...

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.400
 - Oh.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.240
 - Woo!

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.200
 - Yeah, he's like in a cartoon, exactly.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.680
 Some people can pop their eyeballs sort of out

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.840
 quite far out of their sockets.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.520
 - Yeah, so deliberately as opposed to an accidental pop.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.560
 - Well, yes, I guess so.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.320
 So this is the world record for the farthest eyeball pop

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.280
 by a woman, and it's 12 millimeters,

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.840
 which is quite a lot, obviously.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.400
 It's by a woman called Kim Goodman.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.800
 She discovered the talent when she was hit on the head

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.440
 by a hockey mask and her eyeballs popped out.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.200
 - What was the context for a hockey mask

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.040
 hitting her on the head?

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.880
 - I actually don't have it.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.880
 'Cause what happened was that her eyes went

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.720
 (imitates popping)

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.520
 out of her head and she was like,

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.360
 "Oh my God."

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.400
 And then she discovered she could do this,

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.440
 and then now she holds the world record

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.840
 for the farthest pop.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.080
 - How bizarre.

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.360
 - So this is just for women though,

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.240
 because obviously all men have that

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.760
 whenever Jessica Rabbit wants.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.600
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.440
 (all laughing)

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.640
 And they go, "Ooh, got a noise!"

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.480
 Yeah.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.160
 (all laughing)

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.320
 - It is funny how much pushback there always is

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.720
 to protective equipment in sports

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.760
 because it kind of degrades the sport.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.800
 I mean, people had the piss taken out of them a lot,

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:49.640
 didn't they?

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.480
 The first people to wear a hockey mask,

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.440
 the first people who were wearing helmets,

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.160
 and people used to have extraordinary injuries.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.600
 They still do, actually, really awful injuries sometimes,

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.040
 but like eyeballs being slashed and stuff like that.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.360
 - What?

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.680
 - Brian Berard, I think, had he lost an eye

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.400
 and then continued to play with 20 over 400 vision.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.800
 - The old winker.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.380
 (all laughing)

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:17.520
 He had 20 over what?

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.440
 - 400 vision.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.640
 He had numerous operations on his eye

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.480
 to help try and restore his sight

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.400
 until it was eventually at the legal limit,

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.560
 which is 20 over 400.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.920
 We have 2020, but that means that what I can see

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.520
 at 400 feet, you, as 20 over 400,

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.680
 can't see into the other 20 feet away.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.520
 (all laughing)

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.640
 - What did that mean?

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.920
 (all laughing)

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.800
 - And then he was still quite good at hockey, actually.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.640
 - Yeah, cool.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.480
 - But not as good as he would have been.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.320
 Are you guys familiar with the most popular genre

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:48.520
 of sports romance in the world?

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.800
 - Okay.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.760
 - Well, it must be hockey related.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.160
 - Yeah, there is a clue in the fact

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.720
 that I've inserted it into this fact,

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.320
 but hockey romance is extremely popular.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.840
 - Is it literature, you mean?

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.280
 - Yeah, hockey romance novels.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.720
 So Amazon has a list of the top sports novels,

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.720
 sports romance novels.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.400
 - She gave me a Zambona.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.720
 (all laughing)

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.040
 - Wanna park?

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:09.880
 That one I get.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.840
 (all laughing)

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.680
 - All right.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.520
 What was the first one?

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.040
 - A Zamboni is that little machine

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.200
 that drives around to make the ice smooth.

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.440
 - Oh, I didn't know that.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.960
 - James is actually much better

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.000
 'cause the park one is used in almost every title

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.840
 in the book.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.160
 (all laughing)

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.000
 - Oh, so I'm the commercial.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.320
 - Sorry, man.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.080
 - I'm the one keeping this industry afloat, am I?

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.160
 Apologies.

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.720
 I'm the one who's doing some esoteric poetry.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.560
 - Yeah.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.000
 (all laughing)

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.680
 - James, your calf dress can be discovered

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.520
 after your time.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.360
 - Exactly.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.720
 - With the old Dan Brown over here.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.760
 (all laughing)

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.600
 - It's amazing though.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.960
 They sell so many all the top 10 books

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.640
 in Amazon's list of sports romance

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.760
 are all hockey romance.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.360
 - Well, I wonder what their demographic is.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.200
 - Do you?

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.040
 - Canadians?

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:50.880
 - I think I can tell you.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.720
 (all laughing)

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:52.560
 - All right, I'm sorry.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.400
 I'm just wondering.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.220
 What is it?

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.060
 - I think it's Canadian women.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:55.900
 - Okay.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:57.400
 - So they sell up to two million,

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.840
 estimated two million for the most popular,

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.920
 which I can tell you as people who sell books

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.920
 is more than we've sold in many of our books

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.240
 by about 100.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.120
 (all laughing)

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.440
 And yeah, they all have titles like "Puck Me"

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.720
 and "Pucking Around" and "Hot as Puck."

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.040
 - It doesn't sound like romance.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.960
 It sounds more like erotic pornography literature.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.880
 - I think they are traversing that line quite a lot.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.720
 - Yeah.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.560
 - Yeah.

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.400
 - And do you think that,

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.640
 I wonder if it's less about Canadian women just like it

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.480
 and more about you're gonna write a sporting erotica book

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.160
 and it's the easiest pun to make it?

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.160
 (all laughing)

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.520
 - Give me right.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.640
 - We were talking about ghost bus stops earlier.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.480
 Last fact.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.320
 (all laughing)

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.440
 - I don't even just realize how much

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.600
 like ghost bussters they are.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.240
 - Remember, I think there's a company in London,

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.400
 there's a company in London that does bus tours

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.840
 of like ghost tours of London.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.120
 They're called ghost bus tours.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:47.960
 And I think that's such a good pun.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.320
 - Oh yes, that's lovely.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.160
 That's really good.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.120
 - See, that goes down again with a commercial pun.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:52.960
 (all laughing)

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.440
 - So, do you know what a ghost keeper is?

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.760
 - Ghost keeper, so it's presumably about hockey.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.600
 - Yeah.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.200
 - It's a goalkeeper that lets all the goals in.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.040
 - He's actually.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:02.880
 - Go straight through him.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:03.720
 - He's actually a real person.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.560
 - Oh, okay.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.840
 - Yeah, he's called Jim Bob, ghost keeper.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.680
 And he is-

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.520
 - You're all ghost keeper.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.600
 - You're all ghost keeper.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.480
 He's a Canadian hockey goalkeeper.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.760
 And the reason he's notable is that in 2018,

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.000
 he won Name of the Year.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.840
 You know, there's those competitions together.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.680
 - Oh yeah.

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.880
 So that's his real name, is it?

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:20.720
 - It must be.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.560
 I think that's part of the,

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.920
 or certainly it must be his depold name.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.360
 Yeah.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:28.840
 Just 'cause I do love a hockey nickname.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.400
 So goalies have great nicknames.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.760
 There's John William Bauer,

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.920
 who was known as the China Wall.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.080
 Couldn't get past him.

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.080
 - The China Wall.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.320
 - You mean the Great Wall of China?

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.160
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.000
 - A, you can get through that.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.800
 And B, a wall made of China would be very smashable

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.920
 by a park traveling 160 kilometers an hour.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.840
 - That's true.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.680
 - Yeah.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.960
 - Maybe he's visible from space.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.400
 - Yeah, that's what it is.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.560
 - Something I thought was really interesting

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.120
 that I didn't know about hockey.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.800
 And I'm sure people who watch it a lot will,

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.440
 is that, so 10% of ordinary people left handed.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.640
 In hockey, the majority play left handed.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:04.520
 60 to 70% of NHL players shoot left handed.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.440
 And it seems to be that basically in hockey,

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.120
 it's really important to be quite ambidextrous

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.880
 because, you know, you're having to both hands a lot

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.200
 and flip it around.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.960
 And so I think a lot of coaches think the way

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.920
 to get super high level, and the more high level

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.760
 you get, the more left handed players you get,

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:20.280
 the way to get super high level is to breed ambidexterity.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.040
 So they're just taught from a young age,

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.600
 shoot with your off hand.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.440
 So isn't that weird?

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.520
 - You want to come up with a whole new thing,

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.440
 like learn to play it, holding it with your mouth

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.800
 or something, so you can both hands,

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.640
 like come up with something that's really crazy.

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.000
 - What are you going to do with your hands while you're...

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:32.840
 - I don't know, yeah.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.720
 - Because the only thing you could do with your hands

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.240
 in a game of hockey is to hold the stick.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.080
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:37.920
 I'm just trying to think I was like...

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.760
 - You can write hockey romance novels

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.200
 with your hands while you're playing your mouth.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.640
 - You can check if the people are wearing

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.560
 the breath protectors on top.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.720
 - I can imagine what the romance is

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.680
 if you've got a hockey stick in your mouth.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.320
 (all laughing)

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.280
 - When the puck though.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.160
 - That's really interesting because ice hockey

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.420
 came from another sport called shinny.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.640
 - Oh, that sounds painful.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.360
 - Yeah, I think that is probably where it got its name,

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.600
 that people would be wrapped on the shins,

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.880
 because there's lots of different rules to this.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.360
 Basically it's hitting a ball into a goal,

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.440
 quite often on the ice in the winter.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.880
 But one rule that seems to be common,

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.880
 no matter how the game was played,

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.160
 is that you had to play it right-handed all the time.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.440
 But if you hit a shot with your left hand,

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.240
 the nearest opponent to you had to shout,

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.200
 "Shinny on your own side!"

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.800
 And then was allowed to hit you in the shins

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.640
 with their stick.

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.460
 - Oh, God.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:30.360
 - That was, yeah.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.160
 - I guess you're getting the warning, though.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:36.080
 - Yeah, I mean, you can sort of like plench yourself.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.920
 - You can't plench your shins.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.760
 (all laughing)

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:39.880
 - You can't, there's nothing to do.

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.120
 - I feel like you can.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.840
 - Plench your shin muscles.

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.440
 - Psychologically prepare for it,

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.480
 but you can't physically.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.320
 - Oh, I tell you what.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.160
 - You could run away.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.000
 - I'm clenching my shin right now.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:48.840
 - No, you're not.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.960
 You're clenching your calf.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.800
 I reckon.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.480
 - Yeah, but it's pulling back the muscle.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.320
 It's pulling back the skin.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.160
 - That's the point.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.200
 There's nothing in between your shin,

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.640
 but there's a few layers of skin in the tiny bit.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.480
 There's no muscle.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.320
 - You're right.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.600
 If anything, you want to have a punch to your shin,

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.440
 so it doesn't hit the bone.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.160
 - When he walked into the room,

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:09.120
 he had incredibly muscly thighs,

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.560
 but a porch on his shin.

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.560
 (all laughing)

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.280
 He was clearly a hockey player.

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.400
 (all laughing)

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.980
 (upbeat music)

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:23.480
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.440
 and that is Anna.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.920
 - My fact this week is that the Lesseroo people

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.240
 of Papua New Guinea all avoid having sex

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.520
 during the pig-farrowing season.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.480
 - That's my excuse.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.320
 (all laughing)

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.040
 - The Lonely Lesseroo People.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.080
 - Every season is pig-farrowing season

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.760
 in the Alex Bell world.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.160
 What's pig-farrowing?

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.080
 - Yes, it's when pigs are giving birth.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.280
 And I find it quite interesting that there's,

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.600
 it's specifically for pigs, only pigs-farrow,

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.000
 which is nice that they've got that special word

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.800
 when they're all getting piglets.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.800
 And I actually read about this

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.760
 when I was researching last week's fact,

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.160
 and we were talking about pregnancy stuff,

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.080
 and I was reading about Kuvaad, which is the practice

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.120
 which happens in various cultures around the world

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.200
 where men sort of take on pregnancy symptoms

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.640
 or enact pregnancy symptoms or sometimes experience them.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.680
 They'll take to their beds,

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.360
 they'll perform certain rituals.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.440
 Anyway, I was reading about this in Britannica,

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:22.520
 and it was talking about the Lesseroo men of Papua New Guinea.

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.840
 And it said they avoid certain things

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:28.240
 before the birth of children in that mimicking pregnancy way.

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.240
 But this also applies to non-human propagation

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.080
 as they put it.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.920
 So the whole community avoids intercourse

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.400
 while pig-farrowing is happening.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.040
 - Important question is how long is the pig-farrowing season?

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:40.880
 - Yeah, good question.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.120
 - Season's a big word.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.200
 - Yeah.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.040
 - It's not the pig-farrowing afternoon.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.120
 (all laughing)

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.840
 - I don't know, but I mean, I think it's a few weeks,

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.840
 but I like to think that the pigs really drag it out,

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:55.040
 watching these sex-starved Melanesian men.

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.480
 Yeah, it was interesting.

00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.080
 Lesseroo is just a little village in Papua New Guinea,

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.720
 so it's a small portion of people.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.880
 But yeah, what I mean by it being related to Kuvaad

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.160
 is it's about things giving birth to other things

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.000
 and the taboos that you have around that

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.280
 to make sure that it's good luck.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.480
 So they avoid sex in the hope that the pigs

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.560
 will farrow nicely.

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.680
 - I think they had some Kuvaad practices in ancient Egypt,

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.360
 where when a child was born,

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.040
 the man would sort of play out the ritual of labor.

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.440
 So they'd go into their bed and like--

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.280
 - Complain.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.120
 - Basically, exactly.

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.440
 It kind of sounds kind of mocking, to be honest.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.560
 Like the dress in the mother's clothing.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.680
 - Very helpful, I imagine.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.520
 - It could be a little bit more useful, I was thinking, yeah.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:40.280
 - It's funny, when my wife gave birth,

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.280
 I was in the room when it happened.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:46.040
 And she had a caesarean, and what they said to me was,

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.680
 "Okay, your job is, here is a Bluetooth speaker.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.480
 Put on some nice music that your wife would like."

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:57.280
 Okay, and what I think is obviously attaching

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.920
 your Bluetooth speaker to your phone

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:03.000
 is one of the most annoying time consuming things.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.680
 Exactly, but it's just a thing that they're like,

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.680
 at least making the man useful.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:11.080
 Giving him something which is difficult enough.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.720
 He feels like he's done something,

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.560
 but easy enough that it's not gonna affect anything.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.520
 - Five hours in, you're sweating and screaming.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.320
 I can't do it, I do difficult.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:19.800
 - I fucking hate you.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.080
 - Which upper fish did you play?

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.680
 - It was one you weren't in.

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:32.680
 So I was reading a very old book called "The Golden Bow"

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.040
 by Sir James George Fraser.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.000
 And this is like the Bible of anthropology,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.160
 which was written well over a hundred years ago.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.920
 Nowadays, if you look at it through today's lens,

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.760
 a lot of the things that he came up with

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.400
 are probably not true and a bit dodgy,

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.920
 but he did look at lots of different cultures

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.280
 and see what they did.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.440
 And he found that there was quite a lot of cultures

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.880
 where when there was something happening in the farm,

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.000
 like the pigs are giving birth

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.840
 or we're laying the seeds for some plants or stuff,

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.240
 there were quite a lot of people not having sex.

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.280
 - Right, because they were just so busy.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.480
 - No, well, it could have been that that was the reason.

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:13.360
 His theory, again, we don't really adhere to his theories much,

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.960
 is that basically you're taking up too much

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.240
 of the world's energy.

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.360
 And you don't want to use up all the energy

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.920
 because you want to let the crops grow.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.160
 And if you have too much sex,

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.400
 then the chi or whatever isn't going into the plants

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.360
 and they won't grow as well.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.520
 - This is what I told myself when I shared a flat

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:33.120
 and my flatmates were all of having loads of sex

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.560
 and I was sitting in front of the TV.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.840
 So really my pyjamas listening to them thinking,

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.040
 this is fine, this is fine.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:38.880
 I shouldn't be able to talk.

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.720
 - Listening to them.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:40.560
 (all laughing)

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.800
 I wish for the poll you love on TV, Alex.

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.760
 (all laughing)

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.600
 - You know what I mean?

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.720
 There's a lot of thin walls.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.320
 You can hear stuff from the left and the right

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.840
 and you can't hear your YouTube video about buses.

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.420
 (all laughing)

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:58.440
 But yeah, according to him, in other parts of Melanesia,

00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.880
 men wouldn't sleep with their wives

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.560
 when they were training their vines.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.880
 - Yeah, these are all excruciatingly slow things.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.200
 - Yeah, Nicaraguans wouldn't have sex

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.960
 between planting the maize and reaping the maize.

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:09.800
 - Wow.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.000
 - And the Cate-ish people of Australia

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.400
 wouldn't have sex after laying the grass seed

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.280
 until the first bits of grass popped up.

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.400
 - So it's almost like Lent.

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:20.120
 It's just a season of, yeah, abstinence.

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.040
 But then he also said that, let's say,

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:25.040
 this theory of the energy is true.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.160
 Some people thought, well, by having sex,

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.240
 we'll increase the energy in the area

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.200
 and it will be better for the plants.

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.880
 - Yeah, sow some seeds while you're sowing some seeds.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:33.720
 - Exactly.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.360
 And so he said that in Ukraine,

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:39.200
 all the young married people would go into a field

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.400
 and roll around in it after you've planted some seeds.

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.120
 - What, having sex with each other?

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.880
 - It just said rolling around.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:46.720
 - Right.

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.540
 (all laughing)

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:48.640
 - It's like when you roll down a hill.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.480
 - Yeah, I think there might have been naked,

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.720
 so that's bringing some energy in there.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.760
 He said in Russia, it would be similar,

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.240
 but it would be a priest who would be rolled around

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.320
 by all the women in the village.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.360
 - That sounds really fun.

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.960
 (all laughing)

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.060
 - That's like when you got the bumps on your birthday.

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.280
 (all laughing)

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.320
 - So it's just one priest and all the women.

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:10.760
 And then he said, the papillies of Central America

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.000
 have an older and ruder custom designed

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.400
 to impart fertility into the fields.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.200
 And because it was an old book,

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.120
 whenever it was something really rude,

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.720
 it wouldn't say what it was.

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:22.560
 - Oh, okay.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.400
 - So it's some kind of--

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.440
 - But you would put in a teaser, like a little taster.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.680
 - For me, it's either having literal sex in the field

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.640
 or masturbating into the field.

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.480
 - Yeah.

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.320
 - I don't know much about it.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.160
 - Oh yeah, it's gotta be that one.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.280
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:39.640
 In Tudor times in England, according to historian

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.520
 Lauren Johnson, you weren't supposed to have sex

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:45.000
 any time in Lent, any time in Advent,

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.760
 any time in Pentecost,

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.400
 when a woman was menstruating,

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.600
 when a woman was pregnant for a month after giving birth,

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.400
 when a woman was breastfeeding,

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.360
 during any of the holy days,

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.760
 during any of the days when you were taking communion,

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.880
 all the days leading up to taking communion.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:01.720
 - Okay. - You were not supposed

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:02.560
 to have sex in any of those days.

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:03.400
 - But on the 7th of March--

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.440
 - Yeah, what do you mean you got a headache?

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.000
 (all laughing)

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.360
 - On the 7th of March,

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.160
 assuming that isn't a holiday,

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.640
 but not in the daytime.

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.480
 - Right, okay, fine.

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.040
 - So that's being the nighttime.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.960
 - And also, especially in the middle ages,

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:21.160
 you could only really have sex to produce a child.

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.040
 - But presumably people did, right?

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.380
 - Yeah, they weren't-- - Yeah, they weren't involved.

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:25.680
 - How-- - It's just taboo.

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.040
 It's just taboo, it's just not talking about it.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.880
 - That's undoubtedly true,

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.600
 but if you wanted to get away with it,

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:32.720
 you didn't have to go to a church to get married.

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.040
 Basically, it was just an exchange of vows

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.600
 in front of a witness that meant you were married.

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.920
 - That witness was usually me.

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.400
 (all laughing)

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.840
 - The witness couldn't be downstairs

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.840
 watching a bus video that they had to leave.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.680
 So for instance, there was one 15th century couple

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.720
 who got married in Yorkshire while milking a cow.

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.000
 - Oh, okay, that's nice. - That's quite a lot of that, yeah.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.200
 - That's one of those hipster quirky weddings, isn't it?

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.440
 Oh, we did arse on the top of the Empire State Building.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.160
 Oh, we did arse while milking a cow.

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.640
 (all laughing)

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.980
 - Where did you get married?

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.200
 - Yeah, on the side of the other seat,

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.720
 next to a tiny ruined chapel.

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:05.800
 What's your point?

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:07.640
 (all laughing)

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.480
 - Pig sex.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.320
 - Okay.

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.140
 - As in, should we talk about it?

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:10.980
 - Yeah, go on.

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:12.760
 - Oh, you weren't suggesting it.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.600
 (all laughing)

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.760
 Yeah, let's talk about it.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.960
 When pigs are pregnant, they're pregnant for three months,

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.360
 three weeks, and three days.

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:19.200
 - Are they?

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.280
 - That's the gestation period, is that right?

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.120
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:21.940
 - Isn't that weird?

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:23.000
 - That's three weeks and three days.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.760
 - Yeah, I mean, not exactly, presumably,

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.640
 but their due date is saying when they go to the doctor.

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.440
 - Yeah, exactly, obviously, it varies,

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.360
 but that's the official period, yeah.

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.440
 - Nice.

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.080
 - Also, pig sex smells like truffles,

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.240
 and that's why we use pigs for truffles,

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.440
 because female pigs,

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.760
 they think they're looking for sex email pigs.

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.040
 That's what they're smelling and looking for.

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:40.880
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.800
 - And they think sex email pigs live underground?

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.640
 - No, they'll see, like, they just want his fuck

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:49.160
 and looking for anything that smells like a sexy pig, yeah.

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:53.100
 - There is a building in China that contains 300,000 pigs.

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:53.940
 - Real pigs?

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:54.880
 - Ooh, China pigs.

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.200
 - Real pigs, the great pigs of China.

00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.040
 - What floor?

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:00.160
 - They're on all the floors.

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.240
 - The entire building is a pig farm.

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:04.440
 - Yeah, yeah, so it's like probably 20 storerooms high,

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.400
 about as long as it is high,

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.280
 and it's just full of pigs everywhere.

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.280
 - Wow.

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.120
 - And they have--

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.720
 - I'm imagining like a pig office, sorry, now,

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:12.640
 like when they're wearing ties.

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.320
 - You know what, it is like,

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.160
 the building looks like a really sort of

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.160
 dystopian office building.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.280
 It's very nondescript.

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.720
 It just looks like a big old building.

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:28.720
 They have temperature control, ventilation control,

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.840
 the animals are fed automatically,

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.600
 just one person in a central control clicks a button,

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.280
 and then each pig gets a little bit of food.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.960
 And the idea is that if you farm pigs in this way,

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.080
 then you can get lots of meat,

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.720
 which they need in China.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.240
 But also, they don't mix with the domestic pigs,

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:49.360
 so there might be less transfer of diseases

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.200
 and stuff like that.

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.040
 - Right.

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.440
 - Where of course, everyone else says,

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.640
 well, on the other hand,

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.720
 you've got 300,000 pigs next to each other,

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.960
 so if one of them gets sick,

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:57.960
 probably they all get sick.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:58.800
 - Yeah.

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.920
 - And it's also just sounds a bit sad.

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.920
 I mean, I know we do it with people,

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:03.560
 and everyone goes into the office every day, but.

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:04.400
 - It's not quite the same in it.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.440
 - It's not the same as it is, exactly.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.120
 - Imagine if you're late for a meeting,

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.440
 and you've got the address wrong by one bill.

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:13.520
 (all laughing)

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:17.200
 - I was just looking up some other sex-related taboos,

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.600
 like things that you do for luck,

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.880
 or things that you can't do,

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:23.600
 and came across the Banyangkoli people in,

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.120
 they're in Uganda, and South West Uganda,

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.320
 and the aunt in those communities

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.800
 has a really interesting position,

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.440
 so it's her responsibility to make sure

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:35.600
 when her niece gets married that the groom is potent

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.520
 and able to, you know, perform.

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:39.360
 - And that there's actually--

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:41.120
 - Stop looking so, you tell me it's my eyes

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:41.960
 when you talk about this.

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:43.520
 (all laughing)

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.200
 - That plant over there, that parka really liked,

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.560
 it's still doing well, isn't it?

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.280
 - It's really, yeah, it's really fine.

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.120
 - Who jizzed into it?

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.760
 (all laughing)

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.800
 Sorry.

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.960
 - So they, and this is actually another example

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.880
 of how a lot of people still have the anthropological approach

00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:59.720
 that is very old fashioned and offensive.

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.400
 There's so much online about how the aunts

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.960
 have sex with their niece's grooms.

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.880
 Not helped by, I think, people from that community,

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.120
 who say, "Yeah, yeah, we do that,

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.160
 "but I'm pretty sure they're joking."

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.640
 But what the aunt does do is she watches

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:14.680
 the first time the couple has sex,

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.280
 so she comes into the room to make sure

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.160
 that everything's functioning.

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.040
 - How interesting, yeah.

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.320
 Is that still practice, are you saying?

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.120
 - Yeah, it is sometimes, I believe.

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.800
 - If that's what you do, it's not weird.

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.640
 I mean, that's not all--

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.800
 - No, that's true, that's sexual practice.

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:26.640
 That's just--

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.040
 - It's just humans, we just try new things, don't we?

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.600
 - Yeah, and there's always something about all the taboos

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:33.760
 around the stuff that's the most basic thing we can do

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:36.360
 as creatures, like sex and going to the toilet

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.200
 and stuff like that.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.160
 We talk about it, and it's all private,

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.240
 but it is the only things that nearly all of us

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.160
 have in common, so why--

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.240
 - I mean, pretty much all we talk about

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.320
 is sex and going to the loo, to be honest.

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:46.160
 - No, that's true.

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.160
 - Certainly on this podcast.

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:50.880
 - Yeah, obviously, we're advanced as a society.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.800
 - We've broken down those taboos.

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.380
 (upbeat music)

00:55:55.380 --> 00:56:00.920
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:02.360
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.120
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.280

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.640
 over the course of this podcast,

 I'm on Instagram, I'm on @Shriberland, James.

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.600
 - My Instagram is no such thing as James Harkin.

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:17.040
 - Alex. - My Instagram is Alex H. Bell.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.320
 And Anna, how can they get to us as a group?

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.400

 All of the previous episodes are up there.

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.760
 There's also a link, the gateway to Club Fish,

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:35.920
 our secret members club,

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:38.000
 so we put a lot of bonus material up on.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.120
 There's also a Discord that you get access to,

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:42.480
 so you can chat to all the other fish listeners.

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.080
 Otherwise, just come back here next week.

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.680
 We'll be back with another episode,

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:46.640
 and we'll see you then.

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:47.680
 Goodbye.

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.260
 (upbeat music)

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:52.840

00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.420

00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:58.000

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.580

00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:03.160
 (upbeat music)

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.740

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:08.320
