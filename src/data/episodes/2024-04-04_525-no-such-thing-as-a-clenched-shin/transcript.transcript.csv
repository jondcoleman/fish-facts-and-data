00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:17,00:00:18,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:18,00:00:20,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:20,00:00:22,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:22,00:00:23,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:23,00:00:25,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:25,00:00:28,James Harkin and Alex Bell.
00:00:28,00:00:30,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:30,00:00:33,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:33,00:00:36,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:39,"Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact,"
00:00:39,00:00:42,my fact this week is that the original voice
00:00:42,00:00:46,of Porky Pig got fired for having a stutter.
00:00:46,00:00:47,- That is so unfair.
00:00:47,00:00:48,"- It really is, isn't it?"
00:00:48,00:00:51,Because they carried on with the stutter.
00:00:51,00:00:53,"- Did they then do auditions for people being like,"
00:00:53,00:00:54,you have to stutter?
00:00:54,00:00:55,"- Well, they didn't really need to do auditions"
00:00:55,00:00:57,"'cause they had the great Mel Blank,"
00:00:57,00:00:59,"who is the finest voice of all time,"
00:00:59,00:01:00,who eventually took over the role.
00:01:00,00:01:03,But the whole vocal styling of Porky Pig
00:01:03,00:01:05,was created by a guy called Joe Doherty.
00:01:05,00:01:09,He's a guy who died 1978.
00:01:09,00:01:11,So he existed in like the early 1900s
00:01:11,00:01:14,"'cause Porky Pig was one of the original Looney Tunes,"
00:01:14,00:01:14,if not the oldest.
00:01:14,00:01:16,"- The oldest, the oldest continuous one, yeah."
00:01:16,00:01:17,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:01:17,00:01:19,"And so he did it for two years,"
00:01:19,00:01:22,but the issue was it was really messing up recording times
00:01:22,00:01:23,'cause he couldn't control his stutter.
00:01:23,00:01:24,He'd get nervous.
00:01:24,00:01:26,- So he decided to give Porky Pig a stutter
00:01:26,00:01:27,"and then deliberately chosen him,"
00:01:27,00:01:28,or was it like vice versa?
00:01:28,00:01:29,- The first one.
00:01:29,00:01:30,- The first one.
00:01:30,00:01:31,"- The first one, they decided to give him a stutter"
00:01:31,00:01:33,"and then said, okay, we'll pick a guy with a stutter."
00:01:33,00:01:36,- So the guy who invented him was Fritz Freelink.
00:01:36,00:01:39,And he said that he wanted someone with a stutter
00:01:39,00:01:43,because it would distinguish him from other characters.
00:01:43,00:01:45,"Now, have you heard the original one?"
00:01:45,00:01:46,"- I have, yeah."
00:01:46,00:01:50,"- It's like the new Porky Pig is like a fake stutter,"
00:01:50,00:01:52,but the first one is just like a person with a stutter.
00:01:52,00:01:53,"- Yeah, isn't it?"
00:01:53,00:01:54,- Exactly.
00:01:54,00:01:54,- And with a very different voice.
00:01:54,00:01:56,- They decided they didn't like the kind of stutter.
00:01:56,00:01:58,"So they were like, we're going in a different direction."
00:01:58,00:02:00,- He was taking too long.
00:02:00,00:02:01,He just couldn't get through the words.
00:02:01,00:02:02,- Yeah.
00:02:02,00:02:04,- It just took way too long.
00:02:04,00:02:05,- It's really sad.
00:02:05,00:02:05,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:02:05,00:02:07,- 'Cause it's a bit like firing someone
00:02:07,00:02:09,of having a disability and then hiring somebody
00:02:09,00:02:11,to pretend to have that disability.
00:02:11,00:02:12,- Yeah.
00:02:12,00:02:14,"- In a way, it wouldn't happen today."
00:02:14,00:02:15,- Yeah.
00:02:15,00:02:16,- You'd hope.
00:02:16,00:02:16,- You would hope not.
00:02:16,00:02:19,"- So Porky first appeared in a movie,"
00:02:19,00:02:20,short animation called I Haven't Got a Hat.
00:02:20,00:02:22,So that was 1935.
00:02:22,00:02:24,So he was there for the two years.
00:02:24,00:02:26,"- Of course, easiest to write cartoons back then, wasn't it?"
00:02:26,00:02:29,"For a laugh, that sounds like I haven't got a hat."
00:02:29,00:02:30,(laughing)
00:02:30,00:02:32,"- It was kind of, he wasn't the main character."
00:02:32,00:02:34,He never was meant to be a main character.
00:02:34,00:02:36,"He was like a production, a musical production"
00:02:36,00:02:37,where they had a stage at school
00:02:37,00:02:39,and everyone was getting out of their seats
00:02:39,00:02:40,and Porky was really nervous.
00:02:40,00:02:43,So he's stuttering his way through the song.
00:02:43,00:02:46,"But before Mel Blanc, who I said took over"
00:02:46,00:02:47,"and is the voice that we all know and love,"
00:02:47,00:02:52,there was one in between guy who was called Count Guttelli
00:02:52,00:02:53,and Count Guttelli.
00:02:53,00:02:55,- He sounds like he is a Looney Tunes character.
00:02:55,00:02:56,"- He does, doesn't he?"
00:02:56,00:02:58,- Did he go on to do Sesame Street?
00:02:58,00:03:00,- Count Teno Guttelli.
00:03:00,00:03:02,This guy was known as The Big Noise.
00:03:02,00:03:07,Like he had 2000 sound effects to his name.
00:03:07,00:03:09,He was sought after by everyone.
00:03:09,00:03:11,- Like that guy from Police Academy.
00:03:11,00:03:13,"- Exactly, Michael Winslow, yeah."
00:03:13,00:03:16,"And when he died, the Berlin Anthropological Institute"
00:03:16,00:03:21,"offered $2,000 to his family to purchase his head and throat"
00:03:21,00:03:23,so that they could study it after death.
00:03:23,00:03:25,"- Hang on, did they remove his head?"
00:03:25,00:03:26,- That's what they requested.
00:03:26,00:03:29,"For $2,000, can you lob his head off with his neck,"
00:03:29,00:03:31,"which is quite a rare request, I would say."
00:03:31,00:03:33,- I feel like you probably get half the neck usually.
00:03:33,00:03:35,You go for the middle of the neck.
00:03:35,00:03:36,The whole neck is quite.
00:03:36,00:03:39,So would you have to cut it like a v-neck jumper
00:03:39,00:03:41,or something to get the full thing?
00:03:41,00:03:43,- Did they accede to this request?
00:03:43,00:03:44,"- They did not, no."
00:03:44,00:03:47,They did not want to hand over the head or neck.
00:03:47,00:03:49,- Just fork out for the full body.
00:03:49,00:03:51,"- If you want it that much, just have a three grand"
00:03:51,00:03:54,and take the whole thing. - That's weird.
00:03:54,00:03:56,- Somebody ends up with sort of just like the shoulders.
00:03:56,00:03:58,It's really weird to have a headless body.
00:03:58,00:04:00,"- Yeah, who wants a lower half then?"
00:04:00,00:04:01,- I suppose they probably weren't giving away the rest of it.
00:04:01,00:04:03,They're probably burying that bit.
00:04:03,00:04:05,"- I mean, people did used to get different parts"
00:04:05,00:04:07,"of their body buried in different places, didn't they?"
00:04:07,00:04:08,- They did.
00:04:08,00:04:10,"- It used to be relatively common, I think."
00:04:10,00:04:12,"- But still, I think the full head off,"
00:04:12,00:04:14,they seem to often take bits of the inside of the body off
00:04:14,00:04:16,or the other thing down. - Like the heart or something
00:04:16,00:04:17,"like that, right? - Yeah."
00:04:17,00:04:20,- Einstein's brain was bigger than a normal brain
00:04:20,00:04:22,"was why they wanted it, right?"
00:04:22,00:04:24,"- Yeah, the guy who invented head, shoulders, knees,"
00:04:24,00:04:26,"and toes, he's buried in four different places."
00:04:26,00:04:28,(all laughing)
00:04:28,00:04:29,- Where his eyes is mouth and mouth.
00:04:29,00:04:32,(all laughing)
00:04:32,00:04:34,"- Actually speaking of being buried,"
00:04:34,00:04:36,do you know what's on Mel Blank's grave?
00:04:36,00:04:37,"- Oh, it's lovely, isn't it?"
00:04:37,00:04:38,"- Yeah, is that all folks?"
00:04:38,00:04:40,"- Do the voice, please do the voice."
00:04:40,00:04:41,- That's all folks.
00:04:41,00:04:42,"No, I can't do it, I can't do it."
00:04:42,00:04:43,"- Lillie, lillie, lillie, lillie, that's all."
00:04:43,00:04:44,"I can't do it, either."
00:04:44,00:04:46,- It's closer. - That was good.
00:04:46,00:04:48,- But do you know why it's on his grave?
00:04:48,00:04:48,- 'Cause he died.
00:04:48,00:04:50,- 'Cause he played porky pig and he died?
00:04:50,00:04:52,"- It's a, that's a good guess."
00:04:52,00:04:54,- That's all refers to his life's back.
00:04:54,00:04:55,- Yeah.
00:04:55,00:04:58,- Folks refers to the people who are reading the graves down.
00:04:58,00:04:58,- Yeah.
00:04:58,00:04:59,- Which will predominantly be humans.
00:04:59,00:05:02,- So you do understand the meaning of the phrase grave.
00:05:02,00:05:04,"- I feel like we're missing something massive though, right?"
00:05:04,00:05:07,"- Well, it was also his last words."
00:05:07,00:05:08,- What is it? - So actually the reason
00:05:08,00:05:10,"that his son decided to put it on the grave,"
00:05:10,00:05:12,"'cause a lot of people say it was in his will,"
00:05:12,00:05:15,but I believe it's actually that he was filming a commercial
00:05:15,00:05:18,"for Buick Automobiles, and in that commercial,"
00:05:18,00:05:20,"they got him to say that's all folks, as you would,"
00:05:20,00:05:21,if you had Mel Blank doing a commercial.
00:05:21,00:05:23,And they were his last words.
00:05:23,00:05:24,- He dropped dead right then.
00:05:24,00:05:27,"- Well, he didn't drop dead, he collapsed."
00:05:27,00:05:28,So they were his last words.
00:05:28,00:05:30,"- 'Cause they do the music, like da, da, da, da, da, da, da."
00:05:30,00:05:31,"- Yeah, they did it."
00:05:31,00:05:32,"It was quite insensitive, actually."
00:05:32,00:05:34,His family sued afterwards.
00:05:34,00:05:36,- I don't think that counts as last words.
00:05:36,00:05:37,- What do you mean?
00:05:37,00:05:39,"- Well, they're pre-written, they're not."
00:05:39,00:05:40,- But they were the last words he ever said.
00:05:40,00:05:41,"- I know, but yeah, it's just--"
00:05:41,00:05:42,- Which I--
00:05:42,00:05:43,"- I know, that is quite, I think that counts."
00:05:43,00:05:46,"- No, no, but it would be great if that was his final words."
00:05:46,00:05:46,"- It would, just by chance."
00:05:46,00:05:48,"- On his own, I'm at home, you know,"
00:05:48,00:05:49,I'm dying on my bed.
00:05:49,00:05:50,I'm gonna go out with the porky pig line.
00:05:50,00:05:51,"- My cat phrase, yeah."
00:05:51,00:05:53,"- Well, I think that he probably did decide that,"
00:05:53,00:05:55,"'cause he actually lived for another few weeks,"
00:05:55,00:05:56,but he didn't say anything else.
00:05:56,00:05:58,"- I'm sorry, are you kidding yourself?"
00:05:58,00:06:01,"If I was him, I would go, excuse me, excuse me,"
00:06:01,00:06:02,"can I have a glass of water, that's all folks?"
00:06:02,00:06:05,"- Yeah, he's gonna make sure you keep going in."
00:06:05,00:06:08,"Like, it was wasted the last few weeks of life,"
00:06:08,00:06:09,just not talking to anyone.
00:06:09,00:06:11,Imagine they were quality time you could have had
00:06:11,00:06:12,with his family.
00:06:12,00:06:13,"- All the things that were left unsaid,"
00:06:13,00:06:14,because he didn't want to...
00:06:14,00:06:16,"- All right, guys, quite often,"
00:06:16,00:06:18,"people don't speak for weeks before they die, do they?"
00:06:18,00:06:21,'Cause they're in their own hospital unable to speak.
00:06:21,00:06:22,But I do like to think that he was lying there
00:06:22,00:06:25,"faking a coma, just so he could make sure."
00:06:25,00:06:27,"Anyway, his son was like, well, they were his last words,"
00:06:27,00:06:29,I'll put them on his gravestone.
00:06:29,00:06:31,"- I saw an interview with his son,"
00:06:31,00:06:34,and he said that the porky pig voice
00:06:34,00:06:36,that he did was not a stutter.
00:06:36,00:06:39,"He said that basically, Mel Blank once went to visit"
00:06:39,00:06:42,a pig farm to get into character
00:06:42,00:06:45,to see what porky pig would be like.
00:06:45,00:06:49,"And he saw the pig grunting in kind of a stuttering way,"
00:06:49,00:06:52,and his porky pig voice was copying the pig's grunt.
00:06:52,00:06:55,It wasn't like a human stutter.
00:06:55,00:06:57,- It definitely doesn't sound like any
00:06:57,00:06:58,sound or stutter I've ever heard.
00:06:58,00:07:00,- It also doesn't sound like any pig I've ever heard.
00:07:00,00:07:02,"- No, it's closer to the stutter than it is the pig,"
00:07:02,00:07:04,I would say. - Quite pretentious things
00:07:04,00:07:06,"where they're like, yeah, I spent like two weeks"
00:07:06,00:07:08,like studying pigs in order for my role as a cartoon pig.
00:07:08,00:07:09,"But you didn't need to do that, mate."
00:07:09,00:07:12,"Like it's a stupid cartoon, no one takes it that seriously."
00:07:12,00:07:14,"- Wow, they did take it quite seriously, didn't they?"
00:07:14,00:07:17,"I mean, they won Oscars, not necessarily for porky pig,"
00:07:17,00:07:18,but for these cartoons.
00:07:18,00:07:22,- Did you read about the famous blooper reel of porky pig?
00:07:22,00:07:26,"So this was 1938, and this was put together on purpose"
00:07:26,00:07:28,'cause you can't have bloopers in cartoons.
00:07:28,00:07:30,- It's like at the end of Toy Story 2.
00:07:30,00:07:31,- Exactly where they do all that.
00:07:31,00:07:33,"Yeah, so back in 1938, they were ready were doing this."
00:07:33,00:07:36,And so it's a video of porky where he smacks his thumb
00:07:36,00:07:39,"with a hammer, he goes in pain, and he says,"
00:07:39,00:07:44,"oh, son of a gun, which was the stuttering trick"
00:07:44,00:07:48,"of porky pig, he would always not finish the word"
00:07:48,00:07:50,"and put a new word in, but then he turns to the camera"
00:07:50,00:07:52,"and says directly to the viewers, ha ha ha,"
00:07:52,00:07:54,"you thought I was gonna say, son of a bitch."
00:07:54,00:07:57,"And he does say it, and yeah."
00:07:57,00:07:59,"- Scandal. - 'Cause at the end of the show,"
00:07:59,00:08:01,"his catchphrase, he says, at the V 'cause he's trying"
00:08:01,00:08:02,"to say the end, and then he says,"
00:08:02,00:08:04,that's all folks instead of the end.
00:08:04,00:08:05,- Did not know that.
00:08:05,00:08:06,- I think that's what it is.
00:08:06,00:08:07,"- Really? - Yeah, I think so, yeah."
00:08:07,00:08:09,"- Yeah, that sounds like it, yeah, I'm interested."
00:08:09,00:08:11,"- And then they made that in 1938,"
00:08:11,00:08:13,"but it didn't get shown until the '90s, didn't it?"
00:08:13,00:08:14,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:08:14,00:08:16,- Because you couldn't show it in 1938.
00:08:16,00:08:17,"- What, the word bitch?"
00:08:17,00:08:20,"- Well, no, you couldn't say bitch in 1938,"
00:08:20,00:08:21,"'cause like, obviously, frankly, my dear,"
00:08:21,00:08:23,"I don't give a damn, was '39, wasn't it?"
00:08:23,00:08:24,"So, yeah."
00:08:24,00:08:25,"- And it was a corporate thing,"
00:08:25,00:08:27,"so they were doing it as a behind the scenes,"
00:08:27,00:08:30,"as a package of bloopers, they just put that in as a joke."
00:08:30,00:08:32,"- Yeah, and then when they had the 50th anniversary"
00:08:32,00:08:34,"of Warner Brothers, that's when it came out"
00:08:34,00:08:35,with a load of other bloopers.
00:08:35,00:08:37,- So how annoyed do you think they would have been
00:08:37,00:08:39,"the animators at the time when some dickhead said,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,"""Look, we're gonna make this blooper thing,"
00:08:41,00:08:42,"""it's gonna take you about two weeks"
00:08:42,00:08:46,"""for a particular story, and it's not to be released ever."""
00:08:46,00:08:48,Just a funny little in-joke for nobody.
00:08:48,00:08:49,"- But I feel like around that time,"
00:08:49,00:08:51,"during that sort of golden age of animation,"
00:08:51,00:08:52,"and during all the Disney Studios things,"
00:08:52,00:08:55,"loads of incredible workmanship went into stuff like that,"
00:08:55,00:08:56,"that was just for internal use,"
00:08:56,00:08:58,or they would put details in the designs of stuff
00:08:58,00:08:59,"that no one would ever notice,"
00:08:59,00:09:02,"just because they had, frankly, the money in the time,"
00:09:02,00:09:03,"but also the passion and the craftsmanship,"
00:09:03,00:09:06,"and they were really into what they did,"
00:09:06,00:09:07,which is quite nice.
00:09:07,00:09:09,- Do you guys know how Pocky Pig got his name?
00:09:09,00:09:10,- No.
00:09:10,00:09:12,"- It seems like it's 'cause he was a pig,"
00:09:12,00:09:14,"and then pigs produce pork, doesn't it?"
00:09:14,00:09:16,I don't like to do the old back at you.
00:09:16,00:09:17,- Do they produce pork?
00:09:17,00:09:19,"Like milk, or are they pork?"
00:09:19,00:09:20,(laughing)
00:09:20,00:09:20,- They suck pork.
00:09:20,00:09:22,- They do produce pork.
00:09:22,00:09:25,- That is obviously part of the story.
00:09:25,00:09:26,- Was it the result of sort of
00:09:26,00:09:28,six months brains drawing out a pig form
00:09:28,00:09:29,by the writers and then massive?
00:09:29,00:09:31,(laughing)
00:09:31,00:09:34,"- It's, again, from Fritz Rieling, who created him,"
00:09:34,00:09:36,"and when he grew up, there were two brothers"
00:09:36,00:09:38,who grew up in his neighborhood.
00:09:38,00:09:41,"One was called Pocky, and the other one was called Piggy."
00:09:41,00:09:42,(laughing)
00:09:42,00:09:43,- No.
00:09:43,00:09:44,"- Yeah, 'cause they were overweight children,"
00:09:44,00:09:46,"so they were kind of bullied with these names,"
00:09:46,00:09:48,and then he took the names and used them for his character.
00:09:48,00:09:49,- Really?
00:09:49,00:09:52,- That's so weird that the most Piggy name for a pig
00:09:52,00:09:53,actually came from people.
00:09:53,00:09:54,- Yeah?
00:09:54,00:09:56,"- 'Cause I would just think if you're porky and pig,"
00:09:56,00:09:58,"it's like pork and pig, the two piggy as well."
00:09:58,00:10:01,- That kind of says it is a very obvious thing
00:10:01,00:10:03,to call a Piggy character.
00:10:03,00:10:06,"- We think it's obvious now, but at the time,"
00:10:06,00:10:08,it's mind-blowingly imaginative.
00:10:08,00:10:11,"- Sorry, who was the name of the count that you said?"
00:10:11,00:10:13,- Count Cotelli.
00:10:13,00:10:14,"- Yeah, that guy."
00:10:14,00:10:15,- It's C-U-T-E-L-L-I.
00:10:15,00:10:17,"- It's kind of appropriate that he's Italian,"
00:10:17,00:10:20,"because the origin of Porky Pig he was based on,"
00:10:20,00:10:22,"or inspired by, a staple character"
00:10:22,00:10:25,"from traditional Italian comedy, the Comedia dell'arte."
00:10:25,00:10:26,- What was it?
00:10:26,00:10:29,"- So like, from between like the 16th to 18th centuries,"
00:10:29,00:10:31,there was this traditional theater comedy
00:10:31,00:10:34,and it used all of these staple comedy characters.
00:10:34,00:10:35,- Like the Harlequin?
00:10:35,00:10:37,"- The Harlequin was one, which is the servant."
00:10:37,00:10:40,"And yeah, Porky Pig is based on the Tartaglia,"
00:10:40,00:10:41,"which is Italian for stutterer,"
00:10:41,00:10:46,"and it's a far-sighted, dainty character"
00:10:46,00:10:47,with a stutter.
00:10:47,00:10:48,- Really?
00:10:48,00:10:50,- Do you know who hated Porky Pig's stutter?
00:10:50,00:10:53,- Daffy Duck.
00:10:53,00:10:56,"- You're somebody sad, a roadrunner."
00:10:56,00:10:58,- Porky Pig himself.
00:10:58,00:11:01,"- Yeah, there was an episode where he hears himself"
00:11:01,00:11:04,"on a playback of an old tune of old McDonald Had a Farm,"
00:11:04,00:11:05,"and he hates the stutter so much,"
00:11:05,00:11:08,that he smashes both the record and the playback machine.
00:11:08,00:11:10,"And I read this in an academic paper,"
00:11:10,00:11:13,which is called The Clinical Study of Porky Pig Cartoons.
00:11:13,00:11:15,And it's by Gerald F. Johnson.
00:11:15,00:11:19,"And basically this was a paper that was trying to show,"
00:11:19,00:11:20,did it have a positive or negative influence
00:11:20,00:11:23,to have a character that had a stutter like Porky Pig?
00:11:23,00:11:26,"Because Porky Pig had jobs such as a farmer,"
00:11:26,00:11:27,a gas station attendant.
00:11:27,00:11:28,- A farmer?
00:11:28,00:11:29,That's a bit dark.
00:11:29,00:11:29,"- It is, yeah."
00:11:29,00:11:31,(laughing)
00:11:31,00:11:32,"- Well, maybe it was horrible."
00:11:32,00:11:34,"- Oh, right, okay, yeah."
00:11:34,00:11:36,"- He was a railroad engineer, a pilot, a private,"
00:11:36,00:11:40,"in the French foreign legion, a newscaster."
00:11:40,00:11:42,So he sort of makes the point that any kids
00:11:42,00:11:43,that were watching it could see
00:11:43,00:11:44,that they could do multiple jobs.
00:11:44,00:11:46,"- Well, this suggests me that he can't hold down a job."
00:11:46,00:11:49,(laughing)
00:11:49,00:11:50,- That's very true.
00:11:50,00:11:51,- That's a worrying CV.
00:11:51,00:11:52,- Yeah.
00:11:52,00:11:54,"- But you know, I was just looking up treatments"
00:11:54,00:11:56,for stutters throughout history.
00:11:56,00:11:57,"And in the 19th century, there were obviously"
00:11:57,00:12:00,shed loads of quacks suggesting you kind of like
00:12:00,00:12:02,cut your tongue in half or you slit that bit
00:12:02,00:12:05,under the bottom of your tongue or you shrink your tongue
00:12:05,00:12:07,"by having it cut to, you know, lots of stuff"
00:12:07,00:12:09,"which never worked, so you're amazed how long it lasted."
00:12:09,00:12:12,But one of the leading quacks/doctors
00:12:12,00:12:15,who promoted stuttering cures was this guy
00:12:15,00:12:17,who went around Europe and actually was really important
00:12:17,00:12:20,in developing like welfare systems in Europe
00:12:20,00:12:22,because he went to the governments of places
00:12:22,00:12:24,like the Netherlands and Prussia and Belgium
00:12:24,00:12:26,"and said, ""I want you to implement my stuttering cure,"""
00:12:26,00:12:29,which he'd actually bought from a woman called Widow Lee.
00:12:29,00:12:32,"But anyway, his name was Mr. Malibush,"
00:12:32,00:12:34,which means bad mouth.
00:12:34,00:12:35,- Wow.
00:12:35,00:12:36,- Dun dun dun.
00:12:36,00:12:38,"I thought that was quite cool, amazing."
00:12:38,00:12:38,- Yeah.
00:12:38,00:12:40,- It's interesting that 80% of adults
00:12:40,00:12:43,"who stutter are male, way more men stutter women."
00:12:43,00:12:44,And apparently they've done some like studies
00:12:44,00:12:47,and brain scans and the way that your speech patterns work
00:12:47,00:12:49,is just different between men and women when you stutter.
00:12:49,00:12:50,- Really?
00:12:50,00:12:51,- It's weird.
00:12:51,00:12:52,"- Yeah, I think it's fully understood, but..."
00:12:52,00:12:54,- There was a theory in the early 20th century
00:12:54,00:12:59,that eating too many vegetables caused stuttering vegetarianism.
00:12:59,00:13:01,And there was a psychologist called Knight Dunlap
00:13:01,00:13:04,who also founded the Journal of Psychology.
00:13:04,00:13:06,"So he wasn't a proper quack,"
00:13:06,00:13:07,"but he thought that if someone stuttered,"
00:13:07,00:13:10,maybe you should give them a diet of meat
00:13:10,00:13:12,and that would cure them.
00:13:12,00:13:12,- Pork?
00:13:12,00:13:14,(laughing)
00:13:14,00:13:15,"- So when was that, sorry?"
00:13:15,00:13:16,- That was early 20th century.
00:13:16,00:13:18,"- Okay, so like during the war,"
00:13:18,00:13:20,you had to really get the amount of carrots you ate right
00:13:20,00:13:22,"for like good eyesight, but not bad speech."
00:13:22,00:13:24,"- Oh yeah, that's true."
00:13:24,00:13:27,"And also speaking of Mel Blanc, he never ate carrots, did he?"
00:13:27,00:13:28,- Did he not?
00:13:28,00:13:29,"- No, there's a famous thing,"
00:13:29,00:13:32,like there's a thing online that he was allergic to carrots
00:13:32,00:13:33,"which we think is not true, right?"
00:13:33,00:13:34,- Okay.
00:13:34,00:13:35,"- Yeah, it's not true, but do you know where it comes from?"
00:13:35,00:13:38,"The fact that people think he's allergic, it's because,"
00:13:38,00:13:39,and it does actually make perfect sense.
00:13:39,00:13:43,"So as Bugs Bunny, they experimented with lots of sound effects"
00:13:43,00:13:46,for how you can generate the sound of eating a carrot.
00:13:46,00:13:47,And they realized that only thing that generates
00:13:47,00:13:49,the sound of eating a carrot is eating a carrot.
00:13:49,00:13:51,- Did they not have the big noise?
00:13:51,00:13:52,(laughing)
00:13:52,00:13:55,- The one thing he can't do is one weakness.
00:13:55,00:13:57,"- Every time the big noise ate a carrot,"
00:13:57,00:13:59,it was completely silent.
00:13:59,00:14:01,(laughing)
00:14:01,00:14:01,- It was so weird.
00:14:01,00:14:04,"- It just sounds like a car going past, didn't it?"
00:14:04,00:14:06,- Famously sucked his carrots like a lolly.
00:14:06,00:14:09,So they couldn't use him.
00:14:09,00:14:11,And so Mel Blanc realized he just had to eat carrots
00:14:11,00:14:12,in order to get the sound effect.
00:14:12,00:14:14,"But once you're swallowing carrot,"
00:14:14,00:14:15,then you can't say your line.
00:14:15,00:14:18,So he'd have a spittoon and he just had to chew a carrot
00:14:18,00:14:20,and then spit it out in order to then say his line.
00:14:20,00:14:22,"And from there, develop the idea that,"
00:14:22,00:14:23,"oh, he's allergic to carrots"
00:14:23,00:14:25,'cause he was always spitting carrots out.
00:14:25,00:14:26,- I would have just got a runner in
00:14:26,00:14:27,to eat the carrots in the microwave.
00:14:27,00:14:28,"- I know, could they not hire a carrot eater?"
00:14:28,00:14:30,"- Especially if you can't talk and eat carrots, yeah."
00:14:30,00:14:31,"- That would be the most awesome job, wouldn't it?"
00:14:31,00:14:34,I'm a carrot eater for Mel Blanc.
00:14:34,00:14:37,(upbeat music)
00:14:37,00:14:44,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Alex."
00:14:44,00:14:46,"My fact this week is that in the 1950s,"
00:14:46,00:14:48,you could catch a bus from London to Calcutta.
00:14:48,00:14:51,- Okay.
00:14:51,00:14:54,"- You did have to book, you couldn't just like tap, tap in."
00:14:54,00:14:55,- Yeah.
00:14:55,00:14:56,"- I think, I don't think it's outside the office."
00:14:56,00:14:58,"- Yeah, they didn't have an oyster zone in Calcutta."
00:14:58,00:15:00,- Where was the longest stretch
00:15:00,00:15:02,where if you missed your stop?
00:15:02,00:15:02,(laughing)
00:15:02,00:15:04,- Are you frantically pressing the bell?
00:15:04,00:15:06,(laughing)
00:15:06,00:15:11,So this is a bus service that ran from 1957 until 1976.
00:15:11,00:15:13,"You could get single tickets or return tickets,"
00:15:13,00:15:14,which I thought was quite weird
00:15:14,00:15:16,because you could take a bus to India
00:15:16,00:15:17,and then just be stuck there.
00:15:17,00:15:18,- Which lots of people did.
00:15:18,00:15:19,"- Yeah, yeah, that's true."
00:15:19,00:15:21,"It was 85 pounds for a single,"
00:15:21,00:15:24,which I think is about two and a half thousand pounds today.
00:15:24,00:15:25,"But it's more of a package holiday,"
00:15:25,00:15:27,including travel and food and accommodation.
00:15:27,00:15:30,And it was another 65 pounds if you wanted to come back again.
00:15:30,00:15:31,"- Okay, 'cause often a return ticket these days"
00:15:31,00:15:33,is like two pounds more if you get a train.
00:15:33,00:15:36,"- Yeah, no, no, this is almost double, yeah."
00:15:36,00:15:37,- Could you get like that thing
00:15:37,00:15:39,where you split your tickets
00:15:39,00:15:41,between all the different places?
00:15:41,00:15:42,"- Yeah, split there."
00:15:42,00:15:45,"- No, no, none of the complicated."
00:15:45,00:15:46,"- God, we've come a long way haven't we?"
00:15:46,00:15:49,"- Yeah, but we can't go to India anymore on a bus, so."
00:15:49,00:15:52,"- Right, if your bus is 15 minutes late"
00:15:52,00:15:53,"to the next destination,"
00:15:53,00:15:55,can you reclaim all of the money?
00:15:55,00:15:56,- That would be great.
00:15:56,00:15:59,So this bus was equipped with beds and a kitchen
00:15:59,00:16:03,"and heaters and a music system for parties, apparently."
00:16:03,00:16:04,"And also something called reading facilities,"
00:16:04,00:16:07,"which I don't know what that is, like a chair."
00:16:07,00:16:09,"- Like a library, I guess, like a bookshelf."
00:16:09,00:16:09,- Sounds like a movie bookshelf.
00:16:09,00:16:10,- It sounds like a Spice World bus.
00:16:10,00:16:11,- It does.
00:16:11,00:16:12,- It sounds like a lot of fun.
00:16:12,00:16:15,- So this specific first service was called The India Man
00:16:15,00:16:19,"and it was run by a guy called Oswald Joseph Garrow Fisher,"
00:16:19,00:16:20,"which is, I've never heard of someone"
00:16:20,00:16:23,who has a double barreled first name and last name.
00:16:23,00:16:24,- Do you know that he was known?
00:16:24,00:16:26,Everyone called him Paddy.
00:16:26,00:16:29,I was reading an article from the Buffalo Career Express
00:16:29,00:16:32,"from the time and it said, obviously, again, of its time,"
00:16:32,00:16:35,"it said Garrow Fisher, who is better known as Paddy"
00:16:35,00:16:36,because he is Irish.
00:16:36,00:16:41,"- I mean, it is easier to say than Oswald Joseph Garrow Fisher."
00:16:41,00:16:45,- His name with all those hyphens actually would look like
00:16:45,00:16:46,a confusingly like the destination.
00:16:46,00:16:49,"- It does, yeah, because on the outside,"
00:16:49,00:16:51,"it did say London, Kakata London on the bus,"
00:16:51,00:16:55,which I think was quite cool because it is a loop trip.
00:16:55,00:16:56,And the bus went from London.
00:16:56,00:16:58,"It was a 10,000 mile journey"
00:16:58,00:17:00,on what became known as the hippie route.
00:17:00,00:17:02,"So it went via Belgium,"
00:17:02,00:17:05,what was then Yugoslavia to Northwestern India.
00:17:05,00:17:08,- And up through places today that you couldn't go through.
00:17:08,00:17:09,- I guess it must have gone through.
00:17:09,00:17:11,"If it's gone through the Yugoslavia,"
00:17:11,00:17:13,it must have gone through Turkey and then like Iran.
00:17:13,00:17:14,"- Iran, Pakistan."
00:17:14,00:17:17,- It started a big phenomenon of bus journeys
00:17:17,00:17:19,"all around the world and this route became quite popular,"
00:17:19,00:17:21,but it ended because of-
00:17:21,00:17:22,"- It was the Iranian Revolution, isn't it?"
00:17:22,00:17:23,"- Exactly, yeah, the wars."
00:17:23,00:17:25,- And a lot of my parents were not a lot.
00:17:25,00:17:27,A few of my parents' friends have done it.
00:17:27,00:17:28,"It was the gap year of its day, wasn't it?"
00:17:28,00:17:32,And they do talk about how different it was then
00:17:32,00:17:33,that you could go through all of these countries.
00:17:33,00:17:36,"And I know it was Cold War, so it was, you know,"
00:17:36,00:17:37,"not a bed of roses,"
00:17:37,00:17:40,but now you would be told it was too dangerous
00:17:40,00:17:41,to get a bus through any of those places.
00:17:41,00:17:42,And then you just went through
00:17:42,00:17:45,"and we met with friendly receptions in all those countries,"
00:17:45,00:17:47,but didn't they think they'd got murdered at one point?
00:17:47,00:17:48,"- Yeah, so on the way there,"
00:17:48,00:17:51,he writes all about the cliffs around Mount Ararat
00:17:51,00:17:54,and like going through these crazy like hairpin bends.
00:17:54,00:17:57,"In Iran, they had to put wooden planks under the wheels"
00:17:57,00:17:59,because the bus was sinking into the sand.
00:17:59,00:18:01,It had to be dug out of a bog in Persia.
00:18:01,00:18:04,It was sandstorms and rains and incredible heat
00:18:04,00:18:06,and collapsed bridges and like a crash.
00:18:06,00:18:08,"Like, I mean, it sounds like a ridiculous journey."
00:18:08,00:18:10,And there's some amazing pictures you can see online as well.
00:18:10,00:18:12,"And yeah, on the return trip,"
00:18:12,00:18:14,"they were massively delayed by like, I think a month"
00:18:14,00:18:16,"because of an outbreak of Asian influenza,"
00:18:16,00:18:18,so they had to take a massive detour.
00:18:18,00:18:20,And that prompted a rumour
00:18:20,00:18:23,that they'd been kidnapped and murdered by bandits.
00:18:23,00:18:26,And I think the British Embassy in Tehran thought of that
00:18:26,00:18:28,and were so relieved that they like had a cocktail party
00:18:28,00:18:30,for them when they got there.
00:18:30,00:18:32,- I read that definitely they had the cocktail party.
00:18:32,00:18:34,"I read that at the time in the newspapers,"
00:18:34,00:18:37,but I couldn't find any evidence in the newspapers
00:18:37,00:18:38,that people thought they had been.
00:18:38,00:18:40,"- I think it was a story, 'cause Garry Fisher said it,"
00:18:40,00:18:42,"and I think it was a bit of a,"
00:18:42,00:18:43,"hey, they thought we'd been killed,"
00:18:43,00:18:45,"so they were so happy to see us, probably a throwaway."
00:18:45,00:18:47,Did they think you'd been killed line
00:18:47,00:18:49,or did they just have some cocktails going there?
00:18:49,00:18:51,"It's an embassy, they're always cocktails."
00:18:51,00:18:52,- They do have every bus that comes in.
00:18:52,00:18:54,"- Exactly, we got invited to an embassy once"
00:18:54,00:18:56,"just for being in town, didn't we?"
00:18:56,00:18:58,"- Well, I thought they thought we'd been murdered."
00:18:58,00:19:02,"- But yeah, 50 days, they were 50 days delayed back,"
00:19:02,00:19:04,"which is, I mean, oh, I feel sorry"
00:19:04,00:19:06,for the people waiting at the bus stop.
00:19:06,00:19:09,- And then three came along at once.
00:19:09,00:19:12,- I can't do three minutes on a Jubilee line.
00:19:12,00:19:13,"- And they were called Freaks,"
00:19:13,00:19:14,weren't they?
00:19:14,00:19:17,"They called themselves Freaks, the hippie trailers."
00:19:17,00:19:21,"And there's still a street called Freak Street in Kathmandu,"
00:19:21,00:19:24,which was sort of like famously the kind of center
00:19:24,00:19:26,"of where all the hippies sort of ended up, hung out,"
00:19:26,00:19:28,built lots of communities.
00:19:28,00:19:29,"Yeah, so they're still Freak Street,"
00:19:29,00:19:32,"and it inspired Lonely Planet, the hippie trail."
00:19:32,00:19:35,"So Maureen and Tony Wheeler, they did the hippie trail,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,"and then they thought, ""This is fun, we'll write about it."""
00:19:37,00:19:38,They messed up the name.
00:19:38,00:19:39,They listened to a song
00:19:39,00:19:41,and thought it referred to Lonely Planet.
00:19:41,00:19:44,"It was a song called Space Captain by Joe Cocker,"
00:19:44,00:19:47,"and it actually referred to Lovely Planet,"
00:19:47,00:19:48,which makes more sense.
00:19:48,00:19:49,They should have called it.
00:19:49,00:19:51,- Lonely Planet is actually quite a sad title
00:19:51,00:19:51,for a traveling book.
00:19:51,00:19:53,It doesn't really inspire offensive thought.
00:19:53,00:19:54,"- It is for people who travel on their own,"
00:19:54,00:19:55,isn't it Lonely Planet?
00:19:55,00:19:56,"Or it was originally, I think."
00:19:56,00:19:57,- Maybe it was originally.
00:19:57,00:19:58,- That's what I would have assumed.
00:19:58,00:20:00,"But don't, like, I'm single,"
00:20:00,00:20:01,I buy all products as single people.
00:20:01,00:20:03,- Don't put the word Lonely in the branding.
00:20:03,00:20:05,"- So you go to the saves,"
00:20:05,00:20:07,reason you get a lonely meal for one.
00:20:07,00:20:09,"- We know Wendy's meal for one, right?"
00:20:09,00:20:10,"She's like, ""Oh, thank you."""
00:20:10,00:20:11,"- ""Sad, she's good."""
00:20:11,00:20:13,"- ""What do you think I've got?"""
00:20:13,00:20:15,- This is my dialon single bed.
00:20:15,00:20:19,- Some stuff on buses.
00:20:19,00:20:20,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:20:20,00:20:21,- Here's the thing.
00:20:21,00:20:24,Who was the first person to ever be thrown under the bus?
00:20:24,00:20:24,- Oh.
00:20:24,00:20:25,"- You know, this is like a cut."
00:20:25,00:20:27,"If you watch the traitors and stuff these days,"
00:20:27,00:20:29,"everyone's saying, ""Oh, I threw them under the bus,"""
00:20:29,00:20:30,"""oh, they're gonna throw me under the bus."""
00:20:30,00:20:31,"- Is it gonna be like a Roman, like,"
00:20:31,00:20:33,thrown under the chariot?
00:20:33,00:20:36,"- Wait, so are there two possible answers here?"
00:20:36,00:20:38,"One of, someone was thrown under a bus physically,"
00:20:38,00:20:41,but then someone used the term for the first time later?
00:20:41,00:20:42,Or the two combined?
00:20:42,00:20:44,"- Okay, so my question to you is the term"
00:20:44,00:20:46,to be thrown under the bus.
00:20:46,00:20:49,Who was the first person that that term was used about?
00:20:49,00:20:51,Not who was literally thrown under the bus.
00:20:51,00:20:52,It's all metaphorical.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"- Was it connected to buses in any way, though?"
00:20:54,00:20:55,Was it totally detached from what they were doing?
00:20:55,00:20:56,- Totally detached.
00:20:56,00:20:57,- Is this guessable?
00:20:57,00:20:59,"- In my experience, with the QI stuff,"
00:20:59,00:21:02,"it's either gonna be Stone Age, or it's gonna be 1800s,"
00:21:02,00:21:03,but never again.
00:21:03,00:21:04,"- Okay, it's neither of those things."
00:21:04,00:21:06,It's guessable because it's one of the most famous people
00:21:06,00:21:07,in British history.
00:21:07,00:21:08,"- Yeah, yeah, okay."
00:21:08,00:21:09,Who was betrayed?
00:21:09,00:21:10,- Keep going.
00:21:10,00:21:11,- Who was betrayed?
00:21:11,00:21:12,"Come on, let's think of someone famously betrayed."
00:21:12,00:21:13,- Thatcher.
00:21:13,00:21:14,- Correct!
00:21:14,00:21:15,- Thatcher.
00:21:15,00:21:16,- Alex is just a listing famous people.
00:21:16,00:21:19,- Name conservative MPs and stuff.
00:21:19,00:21:21,- I hate people who play 20 questions like that.
00:21:21,00:21:23,Don't use all your guesses on names.
00:21:23,00:21:24,(laughing)
00:21:24,00:21:26,You got lucky this time.
00:21:26,00:21:28,"- So this was, basically,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,"if you wanted to get rid of a politician,"
00:21:30,00:21:33,"you would say, what if they fell under a bus?"
00:21:33,00:21:33,- Right.
00:21:33,00:21:34,- Do you know what I mean?
00:21:34,00:21:35,- We can't get rid of them any other way.
00:21:35,00:21:36,- Maybe with a little accident.
00:21:36,00:21:37,"- Yeah, we can't get rid of them any other way."
00:21:37,00:21:39,What if they fell under the bus?
00:21:39,00:21:40,Then maybe we'll get a new leader kind of thing.
00:21:40,00:21:42,So that was a saying.
00:21:42,00:21:45,"But during the early 1980s,"
00:21:45,00:21:48,"when the Falkland Island invasion happened,"
00:21:48,00:21:53,someone in the UK said President Galtieri of Argentina
00:21:53,00:21:57,"pushed her, meaning Margaret Thatcher, under the bus,"
00:21:57,00:22:00,which the Gossips had said was the only means of her removal.
00:22:00,00:22:03,"So it was, falling under a bus was always a thing,"
00:22:03,00:22:04,but this was the first time someone was
00:22:04,00:22:06,metaphorically pushed under a bus.
00:22:06,00:22:07,"- Oh, really?"
00:22:07,00:22:08,Wow.
00:22:08,00:22:10,"A lot of people threw her under the bus, didn't they?"
00:22:10,00:22:13,I'd never thought of Galtieri as being the main guy.
00:22:13,00:22:16,"- This, well, she did last quite a long time after that."
00:22:16,00:22:16,(laughing)
00:22:16,00:22:18,"And actually, the Falklands law didn't really do"
00:22:18,00:22:20,her any damage at all.
00:22:20,00:22:22,They almost threw her into the driving seat of the bus.
00:22:22,00:22:24,"- I would say so, yeah, rather the opposite."
00:22:24,00:22:26,"- They threw her into that best seat on the top deck,"
00:22:26,00:22:28,where it looks like you're driving.
00:22:28,00:22:29,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, and that is a good seat."
00:22:29,00:22:30,"- Yeah, but you don't have enough leg room,"
00:22:30,00:22:33,so swing them around a bit.
00:22:33,00:22:35,"Okay, just me who complains about that."
00:22:35,00:22:36,(laughing)
00:22:36,00:22:37,Never mind.
00:22:37,00:22:40,Do you know there's a bus route in London
00:22:40,00:22:42,"between West Ealing and West Rye Slip,"
00:22:42,00:22:45,"which is about a 20, 25 minute journey."
00:22:45,00:22:49,"And it goes once a week on Wednesdays at 11, 17"
00:22:49,00:22:51,"in the morning, and no one gets it."
00:22:51,00:22:53,- It's purely for throwing politicians under.
00:22:53,00:22:55,"Those two places are very close,"
00:22:55,00:22:56,relatively close to each other.
00:22:56,00:22:57,- Yes.
00:22:57,00:22:59,- And I can't think of any reason
00:22:59,00:23:02,why I would ever want to go between the two of them.
00:23:02,00:23:03,"- I think, you know--"
00:23:03,00:23:03,- Is it a ghost bus?
00:23:03,00:23:04,Is it real?
00:23:04,00:23:05,Is it a ghost bus?
00:23:05,00:23:06,"- There you go, it is a ghost bus,"
00:23:06,00:23:08,and people of West Ealing or West Rye Slip
00:23:08,00:23:09,"who have friends in the other,"
00:23:09,00:23:11,"please write to James complaining about,"
00:23:11,00:23:12,"you know, why you might want to."
00:23:12,00:23:16,"- Oh, yeah, I'll wait for the flood of e-bells to come in."
00:23:16,00:23:17,- I'm gonna go ride it.
00:23:17,00:23:18,I love riding a ghost bus.
00:23:18,00:23:19,"- Yeah, well, it's the kind of thing"
00:23:19,00:23:20,that people like you do ride.
00:23:20,00:23:21,I think--
00:23:21,00:23:22,- Let's try to get a little less contempt.
00:23:22,00:23:23,"- I can only get singles tickets,"
00:23:23,00:23:24,because no one has a ticket.
00:23:24,00:23:26,(laughing)
00:23:26,00:23:27,- Fuck you.
00:23:27,00:23:30,"- It is a ghost bus, though, you're right."
00:23:30,00:23:32,"And it's related to ghost trains,"
00:23:32,00:23:33,which I actually don't think
00:23:33,00:23:34,"we've ever mentioned on this podcast,"
00:23:34,00:23:37,"but ghost trains are train routes that are kept open,"
00:23:37,00:23:39,"even though no one gets them,"
00:23:39,00:23:41,because it's actually bureaucratically really expensive
00:23:41,00:23:42,to shut down a specific route.
00:23:42,00:23:44,"So there are various routes in the UK, 30 or so,"
00:23:44,00:23:46,"where no one gets this train route,"
00:23:46,00:23:47,but the train still runs.
00:23:47,00:23:50,"So that, you know, if you wanted to reopen it properly,"
00:23:50,00:23:51,then it's still open.
00:23:51,00:23:53,"- But there's more reasons to keep a ghost train,"
00:23:53,00:23:55,'cause it maintains the track and keeps everything running
00:23:55,00:23:56,and keeps your train in good order.
00:23:56,00:23:57,"Whereas a ghost bus,"
00:23:57,00:23:58,you just use the bus somewhere else
00:23:58,00:24:00,and what's the reason for it?
00:24:00,00:24:02,"- Well, because this used to be a train route"
00:24:02,00:24:03,and no one was getting it.
00:24:03,00:24:04,- Was it just driving on the train tracks?
00:24:04,00:24:06,"- No, it's not driving on the train tracks,"
00:24:06,00:24:07,if you will hear me out.
00:24:07,00:24:09,"- Sorry, sorry."
00:24:09,00:24:10,- It used to be a rail route.
00:24:10,00:24:11,"The rail route no longer exists,"
00:24:11,00:24:13,so it is a bus replacement service.
00:24:13,00:24:15,So this is called a bus replacement service.
00:24:15,00:24:16,- A permanent bus replacement service.
00:24:16,00:24:18,"- For a rail that doesn't exist anymore,"
00:24:18,00:24:20,and it's because it's bureaucratically too expensive
00:24:20,00:24:21,to cancel the rail route.
00:24:21,00:24:24,"- Can I ask, why did they remove the rail route"
00:24:24,00:24:26,when so many people want to go
00:24:26,00:24:31,for West Rhyslip to Ealing or whatever it was?
00:24:31,00:24:32,"- All right, there's only one person,"
00:24:32,00:24:33,but they made that trip all the time.
00:24:33,00:24:35,- Do you reckon they'll continue downgrading it
00:24:35,00:24:37,and then eventually they'll just be like a skateboard?
00:24:37,00:24:37,- Yeah.
00:24:37,00:24:40,"- If you want to, it's technically a DFL service."
00:24:40,00:24:43,We're talking about a rail replacement bus service.
00:24:43,00:24:46,Have you heard of a bus replacement rail service?
00:24:46,00:24:48,- Bus replacement.
00:24:48,00:24:51,"I haven't, but I get it and it feels plausible."
00:24:51,00:24:54,"- So in 2016, there were two villages in Scotland,"
00:24:54,00:24:57,"one at Ked and Lead Hills, and they're in South Lanarkshire,"
00:24:57,00:24:59,and the road connection then was closed
00:24:59,00:25:01,for resurfacing for a week.
00:25:01,00:25:02,But this was a bit of an issue for people
00:25:02,00:25:04,"who live there, a lot of elderly people,"
00:25:04,00:25:05,"there's a doctor's surgery in one,"
00:25:05,00:25:06,"and shops in the other,"
00:25:06,00:25:07,and then he's get one to the other.
00:25:07,00:25:09,"And there was a 45-mile diversion,"
00:25:09,00:25:10,"if you want to drive around,"
00:25:10,00:25:11,so it wasn't really workable for all these people.
00:25:11,00:25:15,So there was a small volunteer-run railway line
00:25:15,00:25:16,"that goes between the two,"
00:25:16,00:25:17,and it's just a tourist attraction.
00:25:17,00:25:20,So the authorities decided to turn it
00:25:20,00:25:21,into an official service
00:25:21,00:25:22,that you could actually travel between.
00:25:22,00:25:25,- With the two old grannies who do the heritage tickets
00:25:25,00:25:26,"and they're all typewriter,"
00:25:26,00:25:28,having to print out just hundreds of days.
00:25:28,00:25:29,- Thousands and thousands of commuters
00:25:29,00:25:31,every morning are coming in.
00:25:31,00:25:31,- Absolutely.
00:25:31,00:25:33,"- And it's, I think, the only one of its kind."
00:25:33,00:25:34,- Very cool.
00:25:34,00:25:35,- I've heard of that.
00:25:35,00:25:35,- That is very cool.
00:25:35,00:25:39,"- In 2015, there was a tweet that went viral"
00:25:39,00:25:41,for revealing that there was a bus service
00:25:41,00:25:42,that went to Woking.
00:25:42,00:25:44,And do you know what number it was?
00:25:44,00:25:45,What number bus you'd get to Woking?
00:25:45,00:25:46,- 69.
00:25:46,00:25:47,- I'm sorry.
00:25:47,00:25:48,"- No, I don't know."
00:25:48,00:25:49,(laughing)
00:25:49,00:25:51,"- Oh, 95, working 95."
00:25:51,00:25:52,- Nine.
00:25:52,00:25:53,- Yeah.
00:25:53,00:25:54,- Oh.
00:25:54,00:25:54,- Nine to five.
00:25:54,00:25:57,"- Because I went through Woking on a train once,"
00:25:57,00:25:58,"and I saw the word Woking,"
00:25:58,00:26:00,"and I was just thinking, oh, Woking, nine to five."
00:26:00,00:26:01,"And then I looked at my watch,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,"and it was eight to five in the morning,"
00:26:03,00:26:04,'cause I was going somewhere in the morning.
00:26:04,00:26:05,"- Oh, okay."
00:26:05,00:26:07,- So I was like working five to nine close enough
00:26:07,00:26:07,and tweeted it.
00:26:07,00:26:08,- It's not close enough.
00:26:08,00:26:09,- It's not close enough.
00:26:09,00:26:10,- It has to be exact.
00:26:10,00:26:12,- Woking five to nine is kind of funny.
00:26:12,00:26:12,Like it's funny enough.
00:26:12,00:26:14,"- Oh yeah, five to, yeah, okay."
00:26:14,00:26:15,- Didn't you want to say a successful tweet?
00:26:15,00:26:16,"- No, it did not."
00:26:16,00:26:20,"- Okay, so yeah, there was a bus service called 925."
00:26:20,00:26:23,"This guy tweeted it back in 2015,"
00:26:23,00:26:26,"except after getting however many retweets and likes,"
00:26:26,00:26:29,"turned out that he had photoshopped it,"
00:26:29,00:26:30,"that it didn't exist,"
00:26:30,00:26:32,that it was in fact the 701.
00:26:32,00:26:34,So this bus didn't exist.
00:26:34,00:26:36,"However, the people who ran the bus service"
00:26:36,00:26:38,"loved it so much that a few years later,"
00:26:38,00:26:41,they did change it to the 925.
00:26:41,00:26:44,So the joke became a real thing.
00:26:44,00:26:45,But here's what's interesting.
00:26:45,00:26:46,"- Oh my, sorry, my story was less good,"
00:26:46,00:26:47,but at least it was true.
00:26:47,00:26:49,(laughing)
00:26:49,00:26:51,"- This guy made a joke, which then got turned true,"
00:26:51,00:26:53,which is pretty incredible.
00:26:53,00:26:54,"- He lied, he lied."
00:26:54,00:26:55,"- Okay, wow."
00:26:55,00:26:58,- Could I quickly do one more thing about going to India?
00:26:58,00:26:58,- Yeah.
00:26:58,00:27:02,"- So there's a book called ""Husband Hunting in the Raj"""
00:27:02,00:27:03,by Anna Corsi.
00:27:03,00:27:06,And she's writing about how lots of women
00:27:06,00:27:09,in the late 19th century would go to India
00:27:09,00:27:10,to look for a husband.
00:27:10,00:27:13,And that's because the Indian civil service
00:27:13,00:27:15,insisted that all its male staff
00:27:15,00:27:17,remained bachelors until the age of 30.
00:27:17,00:27:19,"And in those days, if you're a woman"
00:27:19,00:27:21,and you were not married by the time
00:27:21,00:27:24,"you were in your mid to late 20s, then you were--"
00:27:24,00:27:25,- A lonely woman.
00:27:25,00:27:27,"- You were a lonely woman, yeah, exactly."
00:27:27,00:27:31,And so apparently there was this sort of big influx
00:27:31,00:27:33,of British women who every year
00:27:33,00:27:36,would just all go to India to find a husband.
00:27:36,00:27:37,- Wow.
00:27:37,00:27:38,- Snap out of those single civil servants.
00:27:38,00:27:39,- This is amazing.
00:27:39,00:27:42,And there was loads of like pamphlets and books
00:27:42,00:27:44,that people would write to tell you what to do
00:27:44,00:27:46,if you're a woman going to India.
00:27:46,00:27:49,"There was one, a few words of advice on traveling"
00:27:49,00:27:54,"to ladies by a guy called HMLS, we don't know who it was,"
00:27:54,00:27:57,"who said, ""Choose a simple dress of soft warm tweed"
00:27:57,00:27:58,of that gray color.
00:27:58,00:28:01,It is also a good plan to use very old underclothing
00:28:01,00:28:04,"such as can be thrown away when soiled."""
00:28:04,00:28:05,- Excuse me?
00:28:05,00:28:06,- That is a good--
00:28:06,00:28:08,- Is that about the curries?
00:28:08,00:28:10,"- It doesn't, there's no information."
00:28:10,00:28:11,- I reckon that's about the curries.
00:28:11,00:28:12,"- No, you're on a long pass."
00:28:12,00:28:13,"- You know laundry, so they're like,"
00:28:13,00:28:14,don't waste your good stuff
00:28:14,00:28:15,'cause you're gonna have to chuck it.
00:28:15,00:28:17,- This isn't a bust to say this would be
00:28:17,00:28:18,on a steamliner or something.
00:28:18,00:28:19,"- Oh, okay, right."
00:28:19,00:28:20,"- But I mean, it's all very long journey."
00:28:20,00:28:22,"- These poor men, all these women turning up"
00:28:22,00:28:24,"being like, ""I'm not wearing anything under this tweed."""
00:28:24,00:28:26,(all laughing)
00:28:26,00:28:27,- It was when we set up.
00:28:27,00:28:28,(all laughing)
00:28:28,00:28:29,- It's in this plastic bag.
00:28:29,00:28:31,(all laughing)
00:28:31,00:28:32,- I'm just gonna tie it to this tree.
00:28:32,00:28:33,- Yeah.
00:28:33,00:28:34,"- This poor town half way to India,"
00:28:34,00:28:36,they just got piles of dirty women's laundry.
00:28:36,00:28:38,"Things, like, splited."
00:28:38,00:28:41,(upbeat music)
00:28:41,00:28:47,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:28:47,00:28:49,and that is James.
00:28:49,00:28:51,"- Okay, my fact this week is that hockey masks"
00:28:51,00:28:54,were invented thanks to chronic sinusitis.
00:28:54,00:28:57,"- Well, there is only one pewed tissue"
00:28:57,00:28:59,just around the nose.
00:28:59,00:29:03,"- Exactly, no, this is something that strikes home to me"
00:29:03,00:29:05,because I am a very keen hockey player.
00:29:05,00:29:08,"No, I suffer from sinusitis quite a lot."
00:29:08,00:29:11,"So, I'm really glad that some good has come out of it."
00:29:11,00:29:13,(all laughing)
00:29:13,00:29:15,And this is the hockey mask.
00:29:15,00:29:16,"And when I say hockey mask,"
00:29:16,00:29:17,"one, I'm talking about ice hockey."
00:29:17,00:29:19,"Two, I'm talking about the mask"
00:29:19,00:29:21,that a gold tender would wear.
00:29:21,00:29:22,- Yep.
00:29:22,00:29:24,"- So, you know, it's not the helmet that everybody--"
00:29:24,00:29:25,- It's the Halloween film.
00:29:25,00:29:26,"- Yeah, Jason."
00:29:26,00:29:28,"- Jason Voorhees' one, yeah, exactly."
00:29:28,00:29:30,- Who suffered from chronic sinusitis?
00:29:30,00:29:31,- Yes.
00:29:31,00:29:32,(all laughing)
00:29:32,00:29:32,- Which is why he was so angry.
00:29:32,00:29:33,- So angry.
00:29:33,00:29:34,(all laughing)
00:29:34,00:29:35,- But he never said anything.
00:29:35,00:29:36,"He was like, ""Pffft!"""
00:29:36,00:29:37,(all laughing)
00:29:37,00:29:40,"- So, this was a guy called Jacques Plant,"
00:29:40,00:29:43,"or Jacques Plant, or Jacques Planté."
00:29:43,00:29:46,(all laughing)
00:29:46,00:29:49,"Or Chante, Je m'appelle Jacques Planté."
00:29:49,00:29:54,"And he had terrible sinusitis,"
00:29:54,00:29:56,and he had an operation.
00:29:56,00:29:58,"And after he had the operation,"
00:29:58,00:30:01,"he had to keep his nose intact,"
00:30:01,00:30:02,but he still wanted to play hockey.
00:30:02,00:30:05,"And so, he wore a mask to stop the puck"
00:30:05,00:30:07,from hitting him in the face.
00:30:07,00:30:10,"His coach, who's called Toe Blake,"
00:30:10,00:30:11,his first name was Toe.
00:30:11,00:30:12,(all laughing)
00:30:12,00:30:15,That's in the bit at the end of your foot.
00:30:15,00:30:16,"He wasn't very happy about it,"
00:30:16,00:30:17,"but he said, ""Okay, well, you know,"
00:30:17,00:30:18,"""I need you on the team, whatever."""
00:30:18,00:30:19,As long as you take it off
00:30:19,00:30:22,"when your sinusitis gets better, then it's fine."
00:30:22,00:30:23,"- And when, this was the '50s?"
00:30:23,00:30:25,"- Oh, yes, I should say this was the late '50s."
00:30:25,00:30:29,"And then, later on, he was hitting the face with a puck,"
00:30:29,00:30:32,and he went off and came back with a mask again.
00:30:32,00:30:32,"- Mid-game, yeah."
00:30:32,00:30:33,- Mid-game.
00:30:33,00:30:36,"And then, they went on a massive winning streak."
00:30:36,00:30:38,"And so, the manager said, ""Okay, fine."
00:30:38,00:30:40,"""Like, this is obviously working."""
00:30:40,00:30:43,"And then, all the other goaltenders saw this as a good idea,"
00:30:43,00:30:46,and it just became everywhere.
00:30:46,00:30:49,"- And he really defied Toe Blake's wishes,"
00:30:49,00:30:50,"because Toe was like,"
00:30:50,00:30:51,"- Yeah, he was a dick about it."
00:30:51,00:30:52,"- ""You get that mask out of here."""
00:30:52,00:30:55,"And he was like, ""No, I'm going on with the mask,"
00:30:55,00:30:57,"""or I'm not going on at all."""
00:30:57,00:30:58,And he was in there--
00:30:58,00:31:00,"- He was entirely fair, like, with a broken nose,"
00:31:00,00:31:01,"like, hitting the puck in the face with a puck."
00:31:01,00:31:03,"- Yeah, and it's not the first time"
00:31:03,00:31:05,anyone's ever gone on with a mask.
00:31:05,00:31:06,- No.
00:31:06,00:31:07,"- It happened, you know, sporadically throughout the years,"
00:31:07,00:31:09,because people had had their face busted up.
00:31:09,00:31:11,"But Plant, Planty,"
00:31:11,00:31:15,"he's the one who said, ""No, I'm wearing it,"
00:31:15,00:31:17,"""and I'm going to wear it again, and again, and again."""
00:31:17,00:31:19,"And then, slowly changed the culture of ice hockey."
00:31:19,00:31:20,- Yeah.
00:31:20,00:31:21,- Game by game.
00:31:21,00:31:22,- He gave the finger to Toe.
00:31:22,00:31:23,(laughing)
00:31:23,00:31:24,- He sure did.
00:31:24,00:31:25,- I haven't said anything for three minutes.
00:31:25,00:31:27,(laughing)
00:31:27,00:31:30,- Do you know why Toe Blake was called Toe Blake?
00:31:30,00:31:33,"- Well, because both of his parents were also called Blake."
00:31:33,00:31:34,(laughing)
00:31:34,00:31:34,- Yes.
00:31:34,00:31:37,"- And by tradition, you keep the surname."
00:31:37,00:31:38,"- He's bang on, guys."
00:31:38,00:31:39,- Was it a family name?
00:31:39,00:31:40,Were there five or four other Toes?
00:31:40,00:31:42,- Did he have one enormous Toe?
00:31:42,00:31:43,"- No, I'll give you, it was a Toe."
00:31:43,00:31:44,(laughing)
00:31:44,00:31:45,"I'm like, like, inspired kids."
00:31:45,00:31:46,He was.
00:31:46,00:31:47,(laughing)
00:31:47,00:31:48,"He wanted to, yeah,"
00:31:48,00:31:51,they wanted to donate his Toe to science afterwards.
00:31:51,00:31:53,It was so prominent.
00:31:53,00:31:55,"A clue, Buzz Aldrin."
00:31:55,00:31:56,- Oh.
00:31:56,00:31:57,"- Oh, he left his Toe on the moon."
00:31:57,00:31:58,He gave his Toe to Buzz Aldrin.
00:31:58,00:32:00,- It was a small Toe for them.
00:32:00,00:32:02,(laughing)
00:32:02,00:32:04,"- Okay, so Buzz Aldrin got his name"
00:32:04,00:32:06,"because his sister said his,"
00:32:06,00:32:07,- Yes.
00:32:07,00:32:08,- Called him Buzz.
00:32:08,00:32:09,- Called him Buzz.
00:32:09,00:32:10,"So his real name is Hector,"
00:32:10,00:32:11,"but his little sister,"
00:32:11,00:32:15,"heck Toe, heck Toe, Toe, Toe is where it's stuck."
00:32:15,00:32:18,"But what he was known as within the ice hockey world was,"
00:32:18,00:32:19,"- Head, shoulders, knees up."
00:32:19,00:32:21,(laughing)
00:32:21,00:32:22,- Who would have thought you'd get two
00:32:22,00:32:25,"head, shoulders, knees and toes to get into one book of?"
00:32:25,00:32:28,"- No, he was known as the old lamplighter."
00:32:28,00:32:31,- Really?
00:32:31,00:32:32,- And he's amazing.
00:32:32,00:32:33,"- And what, so why?"
00:32:33,00:32:35,- He's been listed as one of the 100 greatest
00:32:35,00:32:36,NHL players in history.
00:32:36,00:32:37,- Sure.
00:32:37,00:32:39,- The old lamplighter because he's so good at scoring goals
00:32:39,00:32:42,that a light goes on when you score a goal.
00:32:42,00:32:42,"- Oh, of course."
00:32:42,00:32:44,- To let you know he's the old lamplighter.
00:32:44,00:32:45,"- Oh, that's good."
00:32:45,00:32:46,"- Yeah, that's very nice."
00:32:46,00:32:49,- So the first actual example of anyone wearing a mask
00:32:49,00:32:52,that we know of was a woman called Elizabeth Graham
00:32:52,00:32:57,of Queens University who in 1927 wore a fencing mask.
00:32:57,00:33:00,"And according to her son, she had done it"
00:33:00,00:33:03,'cause she'd recently had dental work
00:33:03,00:33:05,and she wanted to protect her teeth.
00:33:05,00:33:07,- There does seem to be a vanity element
00:33:07,00:33:09,to the original masks 'cause there's her
00:33:09,00:33:12,who didn't wanna damage more of her teeth
00:33:12,00:33:13,or get more dental bills.
00:33:13,00:33:15,- So it goes a little bit beyond vanity.
00:33:15,00:33:16,So I don't want my teeth smashed up.
00:33:16,00:33:17,"- Yeah, that's very nice."
00:33:17,00:33:18,- It's a hard puck.
00:33:18,00:33:19,"- I'm sorry, pucks."
00:33:19,00:33:20,- They trashed it your face.
00:33:20,00:33:21,- 160 kilometers an hour.
00:33:21,00:33:23,"I don't think it's like, oh, you're absolutely worse."
00:33:23,00:33:24,You want a mask in your face.
00:33:24,00:33:27,I just think they're so mean back in the day.
00:33:27,00:33:29,"- No, but it was, I think she specifically said"
00:33:29,00:33:30,that she was trying to save her dad the dental bills.
00:33:30,00:33:32,But that's probably because she was too afraid
00:33:32,00:33:33,"to just say, I'm really scared of being"
00:33:33,00:33:35,wiped in the face with a puck.
00:33:35,00:33:37,But also there was a guy called Jack Crawford
00:33:37,00:33:39,who was one of the first people to wear a helmet
00:33:39,00:33:41,in italki and that was in the 1930s.
00:33:41,00:33:44,And he wore it apparently 'cause he was bald
00:33:44,00:33:46,and he just wanted to conceal his bald patch.
00:33:46,00:33:47,- That's so funny.
00:33:47,00:33:48,- That's so great.
00:33:48,00:33:49,- That's rotating a vanity.
00:33:49,00:33:51,"- Yeah, yeah, that's more a vanity thing."
00:33:51,00:33:52,You're absolutely right.
00:33:52,00:33:54,- I wouldn't put the vanity on the only woman
00:33:54,00:33:56,that we have in this question.
00:33:56,00:33:57,- I'm allowed to do whatever I like
00:33:57,00:33:58,"with the only woman in the question, Alex."
00:33:58,00:34:01,"- Do you know that when actually speaking of women in hockey,"
00:34:01,00:34:03,when international women's hockey
00:34:03,00:34:06,"first became a big thing, and this was in the 1980s,"
00:34:06,00:34:09,a lot of the leagues required breast protectors.
00:34:09,00:34:12,So you had to wear something solid over your breast
00:34:12,00:34:14,so that they don't get hit by the puck.
00:34:14,00:34:16,"But one of the problems that they had in,"
00:34:16,00:34:19,"I think it was in Sweden, is that one of the referees"
00:34:19,00:34:21,refused to check if the players were wearing them.
00:34:21,00:34:23,So they couldn't enforce the law
00:34:23,00:34:24,'cause it was a male referee
00:34:24,00:34:26,and he wouldn't go in and just prod and go.
00:34:26,00:34:28,(laughing)
00:34:28,00:34:30,- Are they just very hard breasts?
00:34:30,00:34:31,Are you wearing a protector?
00:34:31,00:34:33,"- That's a weird job, isn't it?"
00:34:33,00:34:34,"Like, what do you do, like,"
00:34:34,00:34:36,to grope women before games?
00:34:36,00:34:38,- I started as the carrot eater from Melbourne.
00:34:38,00:34:40,(laughing)
00:34:40,00:34:42,"- Well, we're on referees."
00:34:42,00:34:44,"Has anyone heard of Frederick Charles Albert Waghorn,"
00:34:44,00:34:47,AKA the old wag?
00:34:47,00:34:49,(laughing)
00:34:49,00:34:51,- He had a tail?
00:34:51,00:34:55,"- No, he's quite an innovative hockey referee."
00:34:55,00:34:56,He's set a lot of rules.
00:34:56,00:34:57,One of the biggest things that he did
00:34:57,00:35:00,was referees didn't used to have a whistle.
00:35:00,00:35:02,"Instead of a whistle, do you know what they had?"
00:35:02,00:35:04,They had a cowbell.
00:35:04,00:35:05,- That makes sense.
00:35:05,00:35:10,"'Cause it's like an alpine, I don't know, like mountainous."
00:35:10,00:35:12,- 'Cause you have cowbells into nose sometimes?
00:35:12,00:35:14,"- Yeah, I know, I'm not really going anywhere with that."
00:35:14,00:35:15,(laughing)
00:35:15,00:35:17,"- The problem was, is that people kept turning up"
00:35:17,00:35:19,with their own cowbells.
00:35:19,00:35:21,So you had people making it so that plays
00:35:21,00:35:22,couldn't happen.
00:35:22,00:35:24,- So what they did is they used something
00:35:24,00:35:27,"that no one else could possibly get a hold of, a whistle."
00:35:27,00:35:28,"- Exactly, now this is what's so amazing."
00:35:28,00:35:30,- It's impossible that the audience was just cows.
00:35:30,00:35:32,(laughing)
00:35:32,00:35:35,- But this is what's amazing about the old wag's decision
00:35:35,00:35:38,"is that there wasn't, at the time,"
00:35:38,00:35:40,a thing of you having a whistle.
00:35:40,00:35:43,"Whistles weren't, like, we're living in a time"
00:35:43,00:35:44,where whistles weren't that commercial.
00:35:44,00:35:46,"- You're right, because at the start of the 20th century,"
00:35:46,00:35:48,everyone used to carry a cowbell around.
00:35:48,00:35:49,(laughing)
00:35:49,00:35:51,"- Exactly, and the cowbells were big."
00:35:51,00:35:52,"- There was a lot more farming going on, maybe."
00:35:52,00:35:53,That was more accessible.
00:35:53,00:35:54,"- Yeah, no one really had them."
00:35:54,00:35:56,So you were more likely to have a cowbell
00:35:56,00:36:00,come to a hockey match than you were a whistle.
00:36:00,00:36:00,This is true.
00:36:00,00:36:02,And so he introduced the whistle.
00:36:02,00:36:06,He introduced professional referees in amateur hockey games.
00:36:06,00:36:09,The practice of dropping the puck from a few feet high
00:36:09,00:36:12,"when you're going for the at the start, he did that."
00:36:12,00:36:14,And he also said you can't count it as a goal
00:36:14,00:36:16,if the puck breaks in half and half the puck
00:36:16,00:36:17,goes inside the net.
00:36:17,00:36:20,You need the full puck going inside the net.
00:36:20,00:36:23,"I guess maybe back in the day,"
00:36:23,00:36:25,the materials were different and it did happen.
00:36:25,00:36:26,But here's the thing about the whistle.
00:36:26,00:36:28,"He took it from being, not only introduced it,"
00:36:28,00:36:30,but took it from being a steel whistle
00:36:30,00:36:32,"to a plastic whistle,"
00:36:32,00:36:35,because referees kept getting their lips stuck around it
00:36:35,00:36:36,in the ice cold.
00:36:36,00:36:37,- It's so cold.
00:36:37,00:36:38,"- Yeah, it goes to whistling."
00:36:38,00:36:39,What's wrong?
00:36:39,00:36:39,(whistling)
00:36:39,00:36:42,(laughing)
00:36:42,00:36:43,- That's so funny.
00:36:43,00:36:47,- Something else that hockey masks have given us.
00:36:47,00:36:50,The world record for the farthest eyeball pop.
00:36:50,00:36:51,I...
00:36:51,00:36:52,- Oh.
00:36:52,00:36:53,- Woo!
00:36:53,00:36:55,"- Yeah, he's like in a cartoon, exactly."
00:36:55,00:36:56,Some people can pop their eyeballs sort of out
00:36:56,00:36:57,quite far out of their sockets.
00:36:57,00:37:00,"- Yeah, so deliberately as opposed to an accidental pop."
00:37:00,00:37:02,"- Well, yes, I guess so."
00:37:02,00:37:06,So this is the world record for the farthest eyeball pop
00:37:06,00:37:08,"by a woman, and it's 12 millimeters,"
00:37:08,00:37:09,"which is quite a lot, obviously."
00:37:09,00:37:11,It's by a woman called Kim Goodman.
00:37:11,00:37:13,She discovered the talent when she was hit on the head
00:37:13,00:37:16,by a hockey mask and her eyeballs popped out.
00:37:16,00:37:18,- What was the context for a hockey mask
00:37:18,00:37:19,hitting her on the head?
00:37:19,00:37:19,- I actually don't have it.
00:37:19,00:37:21,'Cause what happened was that her eyes went
00:37:21,00:37:22,(imitates popping)
00:37:22,00:37:24,"out of her head and she was like,"
00:37:24,00:37:25,"""Oh my God."""
00:37:25,00:37:26,"And then she discovered she could do this,"
00:37:26,00:37:27,and then now she holds the world record
00:37:27,00:37:28,for the farthest pop.
00:37:28,00:37:31,- How bizarre.
00:37:31,00:37:32,"- So this is just for women though,"
00:37:32,00:37:34,because obviously all men have that
00:37:34,00:37:35,whenever Jessica Rabbit wants.
00:37:35,00:37:36,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:37:36,00:37:37,(all laughing)
00:37:37,00:37:38,"And they go, ""Ooh, got a noise!"""
00:37:38,00:37:39,Yeah.
00:37:39,00:37:41,(all laughing)
00:37:41,00:37:43,- It is funny how much pushback there always is
00:37:43,00:37:44,to protective equipment in sports
00:37:44,00:37:46,because it kind of degrades the sport.
00:37:46,00:37:48,"I mean, people had the piss taken out of them a lot,"
00:37:48,00:37:49,didn't they?
00:37:49,00:37:50,"The first people to wear a hockey mask,"
00:37:50,00:37:52,"the first people who were wearing helmets,"
00:37:52,00:37:56,and people used to have extraordinary injuries.
00:37:56,00:37:58,"They still do, actually, really awful injuries sometimes,"
00:37:58,00:38:01,but like eyeballs being slashed and stuff like that.
00:38:01,00:38:02,- What?
00:38:02,00:38:05,"- Brian Berard, I think, had he lost an eye"
00:38:05,00:38:09,and then continued to play with 20 over 400 vision.
00:38:09,00:38:10,- The old winker.
00:38:10,00:38:13,(all laughing)
00:38:13,00:38:17,He had 20 over what?
00:38:17,00:38:18,- 400 vision.
00:38:18,00:38:20,He had numerous operations on his eye
00:38:20,00:38:22,to help try and restore his sight
00:38:22,00:38:24,"until it was eventually at the legal limit,"
00:38:24,00:38:26,which is 20 over 400.
00:38:26,00:38:29,"We have 2020, but that means that what I can see"
00:38:29,00:38:32,"at 400 feet, you, as 20 over 400,"
00:38:32,00:38:34,can't see into the other 20 feet away.
00:38:34,00:38:36,(all laughing)
00:38:36,00:38:37,- What did that mean?
00:38:37,00:38:38,(all laughing)
00:38:38,00:38:40,"- And then he was still quite good at hockey, actually."
00:38:40,00:38:41,"- Yeah, cool."
00:38:41,00:38:42,- But not as good as he would have been.
00:38:42,00:38:45,Are you guys familiar with the most popular genre
00:38:45,00:38:48,of sports romance in the world?
00:38:48,00:38:49,- Okay.
00:38:49,00:38:51,"- Well, it must be hockey related."
00:38:51,00:38:53,"- Yeah, there is a clue in the fact"
00:38:53,00:38:54,"that I've inserted it into this fact,"
00:38:54,00:38:57,but hockey romance is extremely popular.
00:38:57,00:38:58,"- Is it literature, you mean?"
00:38:58,00:39:00,"- Yeah, hockey romance novels."
00:39:00,00:39:03,"So Amazon has a list of the top sports novels,"
00:39:03,00:39:04,sports romance novels.
00:39:04,00:39:06,- She gave me a Zambona.
00:39:06,00:39:07,(all laughing)
00:39:07,00:39:09,- Wanna park?
00:39:09,00:39:09,That one I get.
00:39:09,00:39:10,(all laughing)
00:39:10,00:39:11,- All right.
00:39:11,00:39:12,What was the first one?
00:39:12,00:39:14,- A Zamboni is that little machine
00:39:14,00:39:16,that drives around to make the ice smooth.
00:39:16,00:39:17,"- Oh, I didn't know that."
00:39:17,00:39:18,- James is actually much better
00:39:18,00:39:21,'cause the park one is used in almost every title
00:39:21,00:39:21,in the book.
00:39:21,00:39:23,(all laughing)
00:39:23,00:39:24,"- Oh, so I'm the commercial."
00:39:24,00:39:25,"- Sorry, man."
00:39:25,00:39:28,"- I'm the one keeping this industry afloat, am I?"
00:39:28,00:39:29,Apologies.
00:39:29,00:39:31,I'm the one who's doing some esoteric poetry.
00:39:31,00:39:32,- Yeah.
00:39:32,00:39:34,(all laughing)
00:39:34,00:39:35,"- James, your calf dress can be discovered"
00:39:35,00:39:36,after your time.
00:39:36,00:39:37,- Exactly.
00:39:37,00:39:38,- With the old Dan Brown over here.
00:39:38,00:39:40,(all laughing)
00:39:40,00:39:41,- It's amazing though.
00:39:41,00:39:43,They sell so many all the top 10 books
00:39:43,00:39:45,in Amazon's list of sports romance
00:39:45,00:39:46,are all hockey romance.
00:39:46,00:39:48,"- Well, I wonder what their demographic is."
00:39:48,00:39:49,- Do you?
00:39:49,00:39:50,- Canadians?
00:39:50,00:39:50,- I think I can tell you.
00:39:50,00:39:51,(all laughing)
00:39:51,00:39:52,"- All right, I'm sorry."
00:39:52,00:39:53,I'm just wondering.
00:39:53,00:39:54,What is it?
00:39:54,00:39:55,- I think it's Canadian women.
00:39:55,00:39:55,- Okay.
00:39:55,00:39:57,"- So they sell up to two million,"
00:39:57,00:39:58,"estimated two million for the most popular,"
00:39:58,00:40:00,which I can tell you as people who sell books
00:40:00,00:40:02,is more than we've sold in many of our books
00:40:02,00:40:04,by about 100.
00:40:04,00:40:07,(all laughing)
00:40:07,00:40:09,"And yeah, they all have titles like ""Puck Me"""
00:40:09,00:40:11,"and ""Pucking Around"" and ""Hot as Puck."""
00:40:11,00:40:13,- It doesn't sound like romance.
00:40:13,00:40:15,It sounds more like erotic pornography literature.
00:40:15,00:40:18,- I think they are traversing that line quite a lot.
00:40:18,00:40:19,- Yeah.
00:40:19,00:40:20,- Yeah.
00:40:20,00:40:21,"- And do you think that,"
00:40:21,00:40:24,I wonder if it's less about Canadian women just like it
00:40:24,00:40:28,and more about you're gonna write a sporting erotica book
00:40:28,00:40:30,and it's the easiest pun to make it?
00:40:30,00:40:31,(all laughing)
00:40:31,00:40:32,- Give me right.
00:40:32,00:40:35,- We were talking about ghost bus stops earlier.
00:40:35,00:40:36,Last fact.
00:40:36,00:40:37,(all laughing)
00:40:37,00:40:38,- I don't even just realize how much
00:40:38,00:40:39,like ghost bussters they are.
00:40:39,00:40:42,"- Remember, I think there's a company in London,"
00:40:42,00:40:44,there's a company in London that does bus tours
00:40:44,00:40:45,of like ghost tours of London.
00:40:45,00:40:47,They're called ghost bus tours.
00:40:47,00:40:47,And I think that's such a good pun.
00:40:47,00:40:49,"- Oh yes, that's lovely."
00:40:49,00:40:50,That's really good.
00:40:50,00:40:52,"- See, that goes down again with a commercial pun."
00:40:52,00:40:52,(all laughing)
00:40:52,00:40:55,"- So, do you know what a ghost keeper is?"
00:40:55,00:40:58,"- Ghost keeper, so it's presumably about hockey."
00:40:58,00:40:59,- Yeah.
00:40:59,00:41:01,- It's a goalkeeper that lets all the goals in.
00:41:01,00:41:02,- He's actually.
00:41:02,00:41:02,- Go straight through him.
00:41:02,00:41:03,- He's actually a real person.
00:41:03,00:41:04,"- Oh, okay."
00:41:04,00:41:06,"- Yeah, he's called Jim Bob, ghost keeper."
00:41:06,00:41:07,And he is-
00:41:07,00:41:08,- You're all ghost keeper.
00:41:08,00:41:09,- You're all ghost keeper.
00:41:09,00:41:11,He's a Canadian hockey goalkeeper.
00:41:11,00:41:14,"And the reason he's notable is that in 2018,"
00:41:14,00:41:16,he won Name of the Year.
00:41:16,00:41:17,"You know, there's those competitions together."
00:41:17,00:41:18,- Oh yeah.
00:41:18,00:41:19,"So that's his real name, is it?"
00:41:19,00:41:20,- It must be.
00:41:20,00:41:21,"I think that's part of the,"
00:41:21,00:41:23,or certainly it must be his depold name.
00:41:23,00:41:25,Yeah.
00:41:25,00:41:28,Just 'cause I do love a hockey nickname.
00:41:28,00:41:30,So goalies have great nicknames.
00:41:30,00:41:31,"There's John William Bauer,"
00:41:31,00:41:33,who was known as the China Wall.
00:41:33,00:41:35,Couldn't get past him.
00:41:35,00:41:36,- The China Wall.
00:41:36,00:41:37,- You mean the Great Wall of China?
00:41:37,00:41:38,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:41:38,00:41:39,"- A, you can get through that."
00:41:39,00:41:40,"And B, a wall made of China would be very smashable"
00:41:40,00:41:42,by a park traveling 160 kilometers an hour.
00:41:42,00:41:43,- That's true.
00:41:43,00:41:44,- Yeah.
00:41:44,00:41:45,- Maybe he's visible from space.
00:41:45,00:41:47,"- Yeah, that's what it is."
00:41:47,00:41:48,- Something I thought was really interesting
00:41:48,00:41:50,that I didn't know about hockey.
00:41:50,00:41:52,"And I'm sure people who watch it a lot will,"
00:41:52,00:41:56,"is that, so 10% of ordinary people left handed."
00:41:56,00:41:59,"In hockey, the majority play left handed."
00:41:59,00:42:04,60 to 70% of NHL players shoot left handed.
00:42:04,00:42:06,"And it seems to be that basically in hockey,"
00:42:06,00:42:08,it's really important to be quite ambidextrous
00:42:08,00:42:09,"because, you know, you're having to both hands a lot"
00:42:09,00:42:11,and flip it around.
00:42:11,00:42:12,And so I think a lot of coaches think the way
00:42:12,00:42:14,"to get super high level, and the more high level"
00:42:14,00:42:16,"you get, the more left handed players you get,"
00:42:16,00:42:20,the way to get super high level is to breed ambidexterity.
00:42:20,00:42:22,"So they're just taught from a young age,"
00:42:22,00:42:23,shoot with your off hand.
00:42:23,00:42:24,So isn't that weird?
00:42:24,00:42:25,"- You want to come up with a whole new thing,"
00:42:25,00:42:27,"like learn to play it, holding it with your mouth"
00:42:27,00:42:28,"or something, so you can both hands,"
00:42:28,00:42:29,like come up with something that's really crazy.
00:42:29,00:42:32,- What are you going to do with your hands while you're...
00:42:32,00:42:32,"- I don't know, yeah."
00:42:32,00:42:34,- Because the only thing you could do with your hands
00:42:34,00:42:36,in a game of hockey is to hold the stick.
00:42:36,00:42:37,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:42:37,00:42:37,I'm just trying to think I was like...
00:42:37,00:42:38,- You can write hockey romance novels
00:42:38,00:42:41,with your hands while you're playing your mouth.
00:42:41,00:42:42,- You can check if the people are wearing
00:42:42,00:42:44,the breath protectors on top.
00:42:44,00:42:46,- I can imagine what the romance is
00:42:46,00:42:48,if you've got a hockey stick in your mouth.
00:42:48,00:42:50,(all laughing)
00:42:50,00:42:52,- When the puck though.
00:42:52,00:42:54,- That's really interesting because ice hockey
00:42:54,00:42:56,came from another sport called shinny.
00:42:56,00:42:58,"- Oh, that sounds painful."
00:42:58,00:43:01,"- Yeah, I think that is probably where it got its name,"
00:43:01,00:43:03,"that people would be wrapped on the shins,"
00:43:03,00:43:05,because there's lots of different rules to this.
00:43:05,00:43:08,"Basically it's hitting a ball into a goal,"
00:43:08,00:43:11,quite often on the ice in the winter.
00:43:11,00:43:12,"But one rule that seems to be common,"
00:43:12,00:43:14,"no matter how the game was played,"
00:43:14,00:43:18,is that you had to play it right-handed all the time.
00:43:18,00:43:20,"But if you hit a shot with your left hand,"
00:43:20,00:43:23,"the nearest opponent to you had to shout,"
00:43:23,00:43:25,"""Shinny on your own side!"""
00:43:25,00:43:26,And then was allowed to hit you in the shins
00:43:26,00:43:27,with their stick.
00:43:27,00:43:29,"- Oh, God."
00:43:29,00:43:30,"- That was, yeah."
00:43:30,00:43:32,"- I guess you're getting the warning, though."
00:43:32,00:43:36,"- Yeah, I mean, you can sort of like plench yourself."
00:43:36,00:43:37,- You can't plench your shins.
00:43:37,00:43:38,(all laughing)
00:43:38,00:43:39,"- You can't, there's nothing to do."
00:43:39,00:43:41,- I feel like you can.
00:43:41,00:43:42,- Plench your shin muscles.
00:43:42,00:43:44,"- Psychologically prepare for it,"
00:43:44,00:43:45,but you can't physically.
00:43:45,00:43:46,"- Oh, I tell you what."
00:43:46,00:43:47,- You could run away.
00:43:47,00:43:48,- I'm clenching my shin right now.
00:43:48,00:43:48,"- No, you're not."
00:43:48,00:43:49,You're clenching your calf.
00:43:49,00:43:50,I reckon.
00:43:50,00:43:52,"- Yeah, but it's pulling back the muscle."
00:43:52,00:43:53,It's pulling back the skin.
00:43:53,00:43:54,- That's the point.
00:43:54,00:43:55,"There's nothing in between your shin,"
00:43:55,00:43:57,but there's a few layers of skin in the tiny bit.
00:43:57,00:43:58,There's no muscle.
00:43:58,00:43:59,- You're right.
00:43:59,00:44:02,"If anything, you want to have a punch to your shin,"
00:44:02,00:44:04,so it doesn't hit the bone.
00:44:04,00:44:06,"- When he walked into the room,"
00:44:06,00:44:09,"he had incredibly muscly thighs,"
00:44:09,00:44:10,but a porch on his shin.
00:44:10,00:44:11,(all laughing)
00:44:11,00:44:13,He was clearly a hockey player.
00:44:13,00:44:15,(all laughing)
00:44:15,00:44:17,(upbeat music)
00:44:17,00:44:23,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:44:23,00:44:25,and that is Anna.
00:44:25,00:44:27,- My fact this week is that the Lesseroo people
00:44:27,00:44:31,of Papua New Guinea all avoid having sex
00:44:31,00:44:33,during the pig-farrowing season.
00:44:35,00:44:36,- That's my excuse.
00:44:36,00:44:38,(all laughing)
00:44:38,00:44:41,- The Lonely Lesseroo People.
00:44:41,00:44:43,- Every season is pig-farrowing season
00:44:43,00:44:44,in the Alex Bell world.
00:44:44,00:44:46,What's pig-farrowing?
00:44:46,00:44:48,"- Yes, it's when pigs are giving birth."
00:44:48,00:44:49,"And I find it quite interesting that there's,"
00:44:49,00:44:51,"it's specifically for pigs, only pigs-farrow,"
00:44:51,00:44:54,which is nice that they've got that special word
00:44:54,00:44:55,when they're all getting piglets.
00:44:55,00:44:57,And I actually read about this
00:44:57,00:44:59,"when I was researching last week's fact,"
00:44:59,00:45:02,"and we were talking about pregnancy stuff,"
00:45:02,00:45:06,"and I was reading about Kuvaad, which is the practice"
00:45:06,00:45:08,which happens in various cultures around the world
00:45:08,00:45:11,where men sort of take on pregnancy symptoms
00:45:11,00:45:13,or enact pregnancy symptoms or sometimes experience them.
00:45:13,00:45:14,"They'll take to their beds,"
00:45:14,00:45:16,they'll perform certain rituals.
00:45:16,00:45:18,"Anyway, I was reading about this in Britannica,"
00:45:18,00:45:22,and it was talking about the Lesseroo men of Papua New Guinea.
00:45:22,00:45:24,And it said they avoid certain things
00:45:24,00:45:28,before the birth of children in that mimicking pregnancy way.
00:45:28,00:45:31,But this also applies to non-human propagation
00:45:31,00:45:32,as they put it.
00:45:32,00:45:34,So the whole community avoids intercourse
00:45:34,00:45:37,while pig-farrowing is happening.
00:45:37,00:45:40,- Important question is how long is the pig-farrowing season?
00:45:40,00:45:40,"- Yeah, good question."
00:45:40,00:45:42,- Season's a big word.
00:45:42,00:45:43,- Yeah.
00:45:43,00:45:45,- It's not the pig-farrowing afternoon.
00:45:45,00:45:48,(all laughing)
00:45:48,00:45:49,"- I don't know, but I mean, I think it's a few weeks,"
00:45:49,00:45:51,"but I like to think that the pigs really drag it out,"
00:45:51,00:45:55,watching these sex-starved Melanesian men.
00:45:55,00:45:57,"Yeah, it was interesting."
00:45:57,00:45:59,"Lesseroo is just a little village in Papua New Guinea,"
00:45:59,00:46:01,so it's a small portion of people.
00:46:01,00:46:03,"But yeah, what I mean by it being related to Kuvaad"
00:46:03,00:46:07,is it's about things giving birth to other things
00:46:07,00:46:09,and the taboos that you have around that
00:46:09,00:46:10,to make sure that it's good luck.
00:46:10,00:46:12,So they avoid sex in the hope that the pigs
00:46:12,00:46:14,will farrow nicely.
00:46:14,00:46:17,"- I think they had some Kuvaad practices in ancient Egypt,"
00:46:17,00:46:19,"where when a child was born,"
00:46:19,00:46:23,the man would sort of play out the ritual of labor.
00:46:23,00:46:25,So they'd go into their bed and like--
00:46:25,00:46:26,- Complain.
00:46:26,00:46:27,"- Basically, exactly."
00:46:27,00:46:29,"It kind of sounds kind of mocking, to be honest."
00:46:29,00:46:31,Like the dress in the mother's clothing.
00:46:31,00:46:33,"- Very helpful, I imagine."
00:46:33,00:46:36,"- It could be a little bit more useful, I was thinking, yeah."
00:46:36,00:46:40,"- It's funny, when my wife gave birth,"
00:46:40,00:46:42,I was in the room when it happened.
00:46:42,00:46:46,"And she had a caesarean, and what they said to me was,"
00:46:46,00:46:50,"""Okay, your job is, here is a Bluetooth speaker."
00:46:50,00:46:53,"Put on some nice music that your wife would like."""
00:46:53,00:46:57,"Okay, and what I think is obviously attaching"
00:46:57,00:46:58,your Bluetooth speaker to your phone
00:46:58,00:47:03,is one of the most annoying time consuming things.
00:47:03,00:47:05,"Exactly, but it's just a thing that they're like,"
00:47:05,00:47:07,at least making the man useful.
00:47:07,00:47:11,Giving him something which is difficult enough.
00:47:11,00:47:12,"He feels like he's done something,"
00:47:12,00:47:14,but easy enough that it's not gonna affect anything.
00:47:14,00:47:16,"- Five hours in, you're sweating and screaming."
00:47:16,00:47:18,"I can't do it, I do difficult."
00:47:18,00:47:19,- I fucking hate you.
00:47:23,00:47:25,- Which upper fish did you play?
00:47:25,00:47:28,- It was one you weren't in.
00:47:28,00:47:32,"So I was reading a very old book called ""The Golden Bow"""
00:47:32,00:47:35,by Sir James George Fraser.
00:47:35,00:47:38,"And this is like the Bible of anthropology,"
00:47:38,00:47:41,which was written well over a hundred years ago.
00:47:41,00:47:43,"Nowadays, if you look at it through today's lens,"
00:47:43,00:47:45,a lot of the things that he came up with
00:47:45,00:47:48,"are probably not true and a bit dodgy,"
00:47:48,00:47:50,but he did look at lots of different cultures
00:47:50,00:47:52,and see what they did.
00:47:52,00:47:54,And he found that there was quite a lot of cultures
00:47:54,00:47:57,"where when there was something happening in the farm,"
00:47:57,00:48:00,like the pigs are giving birth
00:48:00,00:48:02,"or we're laying the seeds for some plants or stuff,"
00:48:02,00:48:05,there were quite a lot of people not having sex.
00:48:05,00:48:07,"- Right, because they were just so busy."
00:48:07,00:48:09,"- No, well, it could have been that that was the reason."
00:48:09,00:48:13,"His theory, again, we don't really adhere to his theories much,"
00:48:13,00:48:16,is that basically you're taking up too much
00:48:16,00:48:19,of the world's energy.
00:48:19,00:48:21,And you don't want to use up all the energy
00:48:21,00:48:23,because you want to let the crops grow.
00:48:23,00:48:25,"And if you have too much sex,"
00:48:25,00:48:28,then the chi or whatever isn't going into the plants
00:48:28,00:48:29,and they won't grow as well.
00:48:29,00:48:31,- This is what I told myself when I shared a flat
00:48:31,00:48:33,and my flatmates were all of having loads of sex
00:48:33,00:48:34,and I was sitting in front of the TV.
00:48:34,00:48:36,"So really my pyjamas listening to them thinking,"
00:48:36,00:48:38,"this is fine, this is fine."
00:48:38,00:48:38,I shouldn't be able to talk.
00:48:38,00:48:39,- Listening to them.
00:48:39,00:48:40,(all laughing)
00:48:40,00:48:42,"I wish for the poll you love on TV, Alex."
00:48:42,00:48:44,(all laughing)
00:48:44,00:48:45,- You know what I mean?
00:48:45,00:48:46,There's a lot of thin walls.
00:48:46,00:48:48,You can hear stuff from the left and the right
00:48:48,00:48:50,and you can't hear your YouTube video about buses.
00:48:50,00:48:53,(all laughing)
00:48:53,00:48:58,"But yeah, according to him, in other parts of Melanesia,"
00:48:58,00:48:59,men wouldn't sleep with their wives
00:48:59,00:49:01,when they were training their vines.
00:49:01,00:49:03,"- Yeah, these are all excruciatingly slow things."
00:49:03,00:49:06,"- Yeah, Nicaraguans wouldn't have sex"
00:49:06,00:49:08,between planting the maize and reaping the maize.
00:49:08,00:49:09,- Wow.
00:49:09,00:49:11,- And the Cate-ish people of Australia
00:49:11,00:49:13,wouldn't have sex after laying the grass seed
00:49:13,00:49:15,until the first bits of grass popped up.
00:49:15,00:49:16,- So it's almost like Lent.
00:49:16,00:49:20,"It's just a season of, yeah, abstinence."
00:49:20,00:49:22,"But then he also said that, let's say,"
00:49:22,00:49:25,this theory of the energy is true.
00:49:25,00:49:27,"Some people thought, well, by having sex,"
00:49:27,00:49:29,we'll increase the energy in the area
00:49:29,00:49:31,and it will be better for the plants.
00:49:31,00:49:32,"- Yeah, sow some seeds while you're sowing some seeds."
00:49:32,00:49:33,- Exactly.
00:49:33,00:49:36,"And so he said that in Ukraine,"
00:49:36,00:49:39,all the young married people would go into a field
00:49:39,00:49:42,and roll around in it after you've planted some seeds.
00:49:42,00:49:44,"- What, having sex with each other?"
00:49:44,00:49:45,- It just said rolling around.
00:49:45,00:49:46,- Right.
00:49:46,00:49:47,(all laughing)
00:49:47,00:49:48,- It's like when you roll down a hill.
00:49:48,00:49:50,"- Yeah, I think there might have been naked,"
00:49:50,00:49:52,so that's bringing some energy in there.
00:49:52,00:49:54,"He said in Russia, it would be similar,"
00:49:54,00:49:57,but it would be a priest who would be rolled around
00:49:57,00:49:59,by all the women in the village.
00:49:59,00:50:00,- That sounds really fun.
00:50:00,00:50:01,(all laughing)
00:50:01,00:50:04,- That's like when you got the bumps on your birthday.
00:50:04,00:50:05,(all laughing)
00:50:05,00:50:07,- So it's just one priest and all the women.
00:50:07,00:50:10,"And then he said, the papillies of Central America"
00:50:10,00:50:14,have an older and ruder custom designed
00:50:14,00:50:16,to impart fertility into the fields.
00:50:16,00:50:18,"And because it was an old book,"
00:50:18,00:50:20,"whenever it was something really rude,"
00:50:20,00:50:21,it wouldn't say what it was.
00:50:21,00:50:22,"- Oh, okay."
00:50:22,00:50:24,- So it's some kind of--
00:50:24,00:50:26,"- But you would put in a teaser, like a little taster."
00:50:26,00:50:29,"- For me, it's either having literal sex in the field"
00:50:29,00:50:31,or masturbating into the field.
00:50:31,00:50:32,- Yeah.
00:50:32,00:50:33,- I don't know much about it.
00:50:33,00:50:34,"- Oh yeah, it's gotta be that one."
00:50:34,00:50:35,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:50:35,00:50:39,"In Tudor times in England, according to historian"
00:50:39,00:50:42,"Lauren Johnson, you weren't supposed to have sex"
00:50:42,00:50:45,"any time in Lent, any time in Advent,"
00:50:45,00:50:46,"any time in Pentecost,"
00:50:46,00:50:48,"when a woman was menstruating,"
00:50:48,00:50:51,"when a woman was pregnant for a month after giving birth,"
00:50:51,00:50:53,"when a woman was breastfeeding,"
00:50:53,00:50:55,"during any of the holy days,"
00:50:55,00:50:57,"during any of the days when you were taking communion,"
00:50:57,00:51:00,all the days leading up to taking communion.
00:51:00,00:51:01,- Okay. - You were not supposed
00:51:01,00:51:02,to have sex in any of those days.
00:51:02,00:51:03,- But on the 7th of March--
00:51:03,00:51:05,"- Yeah, what do you mean you got a headache?"
00:51:05,00:51:08,(all laughing)
00:51:08,00:51:09,"- On the 7th of March,"
00:51:09,00:51:11,"assuming that isn't a holiday,"
00:51:11,00:51:12,but not in the daytime.
00:51:12,00:51:13,"- Right, okay, fine."
00:51:13,00:51:15,- So that's being the nighttime.
00:51:15,00:51:17,"- And also, especially in the middle ages,"
00:51:17,00:51:21,you could only really have sex to produce a child.
00:51:21,00:51:23,"- But presumably people did, right?"
00:51:23,00:51:24,"- Yeah, they weren't-- - Yeah, they weren't involved."
00:51:24,00:51:25,- How-- - It's just taboo.
00:51:25,00:51:27,"It's just taboo, it's just not talking about it."
00:51:27,00:51:28,"- That's undoubtedly true,"
00:51:28,00:51:30,"but if you wanted to get away with it,"
00:51:30,00:51:32,you didn't have to go to a church to get married.
00:51:32,00:51:35,"Basically, it was just an exchange of vows"
00:51:35,00:51:37,in front of a witness that meant you were married.
00:51:37,00:51:38,- That witness was usually me.
00:51:38,00:51:40,(all laughing)
00:51:40,00:51:41,- The witness couldn't be downstairs
00:51:41,00:51:44,watching a bus video that they had to leave.
00:51:44,00:51:47,"So for instance, there was one 15th century couple"
00:51:47,00:51:50,who got married in Yorkshire while milking a cow.
00:51:50,00:51:53,"- Oh, okay, that's nice. - That's quite a lot of that, yeah."
00:51:53,00:51:55,"- That's one of those hipster quirky weddings, isn't it?"
00:51:55,00:51:57,"Oh, we did arse on the top of the Empire State Building."
00:51:57,00:51:59,"Oh, we did arse while milking a cow."
00:51:59,00:52:00,(all laughing)
00:52:00,00:52:01,- Where did you get married?
00:52:01,00:52:03,"- Yeah, on the side of the other seat,"
00:52:03,00:52:04,next to a tiny ruined chapel.
00:52:04,00:52:05,What's your point?
00:52:05,00:52:07,(all laughing)
00:52:07,00:52:08,- Pig sex.
00:52:08,00:52:09,- Okay.
00:52:09,00:52:10,"- As in, should we talk about it?"
00:52:10,00:52:10,"- Yeah, go on."
00:52:10,00:52:12,"- Oh, you weren't suggesting it."
00:52:12,00:52:13,(all laughing)
00:52:13,00:52:14,"Yeah, let's talk about it."
00:52:14,00:52:16,"When pigs are pregnant, they're pregnant for three months,"
00:52:16,00:52:18,"three weeks, and three days."
00:52:18,00:52:19,- Are they?
00:52:19,00:52:20,"- That's the gestation period, is that right?"
00:52:20,00:52:21,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:52:21,00:52:21,- Isn't that weird?
00:52:21,00:52:23,- That's three weeks and three days.
00:52:23,00:52:24,"- Yeah, I mean, not exactly, presumably,"
00:52:24,00:52:26,but their due date is saying when they go to the doctor.
00:52:26,00:52:28,"- Yeah, exactly, obviously, it varies,"
00:52:28,00:52:30,"but that's the official period, yeah."
00:52:30,00:52:31,- Nice.
00:52:31,00:52:33,"- Also, pig sex smells like truffles,"
00:52:33,00:52:35,"and that's why we use pigs for truffles,"
00:52:35,00:52:36,"because female pigs,"
00:52:36,00:52:38,they think they're looking for sex email pigs.
00:52:38,00:52:40,That's what they're smelling and looking for.
00:52:40,00:52:40,- Really? - Yeah.
00:52:40,00:52:42,- And they think sex email pigs live underground?
00:52:42,00:52:45,"- No, they'll see, like, they just want his fuck"
00:52:45,00:52:49,"and looking for anything that smells like a sexy pig, yeah."
00:52:49,00:52:53,"- There is a building in China that contains 300,000 pigs."
00:52:53,00:52:53,- Real pigs?
00:52:53,00:52:54,"- Ooh, China pigs."
00:52:54,00:52:58,"- Real pigs, the great pigs of China."
00:52:58,00:52:59,- What floor?
00:52:59,00:53:00,- They're on all the floors.
00:53:00,00:53:01,- The entire building is a pig farm.
00:53:01,00:53:04,"- Yeah, yeah, so it's like probably 20 storerooms high,"
00:53:04,00:53:06,"about as long as it is high,"
00:53:06,00:53:08,and it's just full of pigs everywhere.
00:53:08,00:53:09,- Wow.
00:53:09,00:53:10,- And they have--
00:53:10,00:53:11,"- I'm imagining like a pig office, sorry, now,"
00:53:11,00:53:12,like when they're wearing ties.
00:53:12,00:53:14,"- You know what, it is like,"
00:53:14,00:53:17,the building looks like a really sort of
00:53:17,00:53:19,dystopian office building.
00:53:19,00:53:21,It's very nondescript.
00:53:21,00:53:23,It just looks like a big old building.
00:53:23,00:53:28,"They have temperature control, ventilation control,"
00:53:28,00:53:30,"the animals are fed automatically,"
00:53:30,00:53:33,"just one person in a central control clicks a button,"
00:53:33,00:53:36,and then each pig gets a little bit of food.
00:53:36,00:53:39,"And the idea is that if you farm pigs in this way,"
00:53:39,00:53:41,"then you can get lots of meat,"
00:53:41,00:53:42,which they need in China.
00:53:42,00:53:46,"But also, they don't mix with the domestic pigs,"
00:53:46,00:53:49,so there might be less transfer of diseases
00:53:49,00:53:50,and stuff like that.
00:53:50,00:53:51,- Right.
00:53:51,00:53:52,"- Where of course, everyone else says,"
00:53:52,00:53:53,"well, on the other hand,"
00:53:53,00:53:55,"you've got 300,000 pigs next to each other,"
00:53:55,00:53:56,"so if one of them gets sick,"
00:53:56,00:53:57,probably they all get sick.
00:53:57,00:53:58,- Yeah.
00:53:58,00:54:00,- And it's also just sounds a bit sad.
00:54:00,00:54:01,"I mean, I know we do it with people,"
00:54:01,00:54:03,"and everyone goes into the office every day, but."
00:54:03,00:54:04,- It's not quite the same in it.
00:54:04,00:54:06,"- It's not the same as it is, exactly."
00:54:06,00:54:08,"- Imagine if you're late for a meeting,"
00:54:08,00:54:10,and you've got the address wrong by one bill.
00:54:10,00:54:13,(all laughing)
00:54:13,00:54:17,"- I was just looking up some other sex-related taboos,"
00:54:17,00:54:18,"like things that you do for luck,"
00:54:18,00:54:19,"or things that you can't do,"
00:54:19,00:54:23,"and came across the Banyangkoli people in,"
00:54:23,00:54:26,"they're in Uganda, and South West Uganda,"
00:54:26,00:54:28,and the aunt in those communities
00:54:28,00:54:29,"has a really interesting position,"
00:54:29,00:54:32,so it's her responsibility to make sure
00:54:32,00:54:35,when her niece gets married that the groom is potent
00:54:35,00:54:38,"and able to, you know, perform."
00:54:38,00:54:39,- And that there's actually--
00:54:39,00:54:41,"- Stop looking so, you tell me it's my eyes"
00:54:41,00:54:41,when you talk about this.
00:54:41,00:54:43,(all laughing)
00:54:43,00:54:46,"- That plant over there, that parka really liked,"
00:54:46,00:54:47,"it's still doing well, isn't it?"
00:54:47,00:54:49,"- It's really, yeah, it's really fine."
00:54:49,00:54:50,- Who jizzed into it?
00:54:50,00:54:51,(all laughing)
00:54:51,00:54:52,Sorry.
00:54:52,00:54:54,"- So they, and this is actually another example"
00:54:54,00:54:57,of how a lot of people still have the anthropological approach
00:54:57,00:54:59,that is very old fashioned and offensive.
00:54:59,00:55:02,There's so much online about how the aunts
00:55:02,00:55:04,have sex with their niece's grooms.
00:55:04,00:55:06,"Not helped by, I think, people from that community,"
00:55:06,00:55:08,"who say, ""Yeah, yeah, we do that,"
00:55:08,00:55:10,"""but I'm pretty sure they're joking."""
00:55:10,00:55:12,But what the aunt does do is she watches
00:55:12,00:55:14,"the first time the couple has sex,"
00:55:14,00:55:16,so she comes into the room to make sure
00:55:16,00:55:18,that everything's functioning.
00:55:18,00:55:19,"- How interesting, yeah."
00:55:19,00:55:20,"Is that still practice, are you saying?"
00:55:20,00:55:22,"- Yeah, it is sometimes, I believe."
00:55:22,00:55:23,"- If that's what you do, it's not weird."
00:55:23,00:55:24,"I mean, that's not all--"
00:55:24,00:55:25,"- No, that's true, that's sexual practice."
00:55:25,00:55:26,That's just--
00:55:26,00:55:29,"- It's just humans, we just try new things, don't we?"
00:55:29,00:55:31,"- Yeah, and there's always something about all the taboos"
00:55:31,00:55:33,around the stuff that's the most basic thing we can do
00:55:33,00:55:36,"as creatures, like sex and going to the toilet"
00:55:36,00:55:37,and stuff like that.
00:55:37,00:55:39,"We talk about it, and it's all private,"
00:55:39,00:55:41,but it is the only things that nearly all of us
00:55:41,00:55:43,"have in common, so why--"
00:55:43,00:55:44,"- I mean, pretty much all we talk about"
00:55:44,00:55:45,"is sex and going to the loo, to be honest."
00:55:45,00:55:46,"- No, that's true."
00:55:46,00:55:47,- Certainly on this podcast.
00:55:47,00:55:50,"- Yeah, obviously, we're advanced as a society."
00:55:50,00:55:52,- We've broken down those taboos.
00:55:52,00:55:55,(upbeat music)
00:55:55,00:56:00,"- Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts."
00:56:00,00:56:02,Thank you so much for listening.
