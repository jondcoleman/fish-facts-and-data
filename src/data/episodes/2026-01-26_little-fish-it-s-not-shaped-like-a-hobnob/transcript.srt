00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,920
 Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of Little Fish.

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,000
 This is the show where we do away with our facts, the ones that we spent time looking

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 for.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,240
 And we look at your facts, your brilliant, excellent, amazing facts that you send to us every

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,840
 week at PodcastActQI.com.

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,160
 We will read through them, we'll chat about them, we'll give you a little bit of extra

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,080
 information that we found ourselves and then we will go into our custodianship section

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,120
 where we hand out some facts to people who are in our friend of the podcast here on Patreon.

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,840
 Anyway, without further ado, let's get into the facts, Dan, give us a fact.

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,040
 Okay, this has been sent in by Fiona McDonald and she says, "I found out that cheese

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:04,240
 meltability is measured using a scale called the Schreiber scale."

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
 Lovely.

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
 Fantastic.

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,720
 I'll be honest, I haven't read the article in depth, but thought it sounded interesting.

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
 It's very beautiful.

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
 Very beautiful.

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
 Thank you Fiona.

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
 Cool.

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,920
 Yeah, so this is, there was a company that was founded in 1945, which came to be known

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,800
 as Schreiber Foods and it was founded by a man called LD Schreiber in partnership with

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,400
 his friend Merlin.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,560
 Hello, just a first thing, German, are they?

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,720
 No, no, they're North American, I believe.

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,080
 I guess interesting to give your company a German name in 1945.

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,200
 Yeah, well, they're massive, by the way.

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
 Yeah, it's so big.

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
 Big Jesus.

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,880
 Big Jesus, they provide the cheese slices that are used on 17 of the top 20 hamburger chains

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
 in America.

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
 Wow.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,440
 They are massive, $7 billion in sales every year.

32
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:03,120
 They developed the Schreiber Meltability Test to monitor how cheese handles heats.

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,720
 Did we have a live stage, cheese eating competition with each other?

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
 We did.

35
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
 We did.

36
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,120
 We did it for the most cheese slices eaten in something like a minute.

37
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,240
 I set up, while we were on tour, a chance for us to get a Guinness World record and Craig

38
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:24,640
 Glenday, editor-in-chief, came on to stage, pre-printed a certificate in case we managed it.

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,760
 And the four of us tried to eat as many slices.

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,960
 Now, it was an impossible task, I would argue.

41
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,400
 I don't think even the greatest cheesy to could manage it.

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,920
 No, no, no, no.

43
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,640
 The greatest cheesy to cod manage it, that's the thing about the records.

44
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
 This isn't a record.

45
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
 No one has ever set it.

46
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
 I was going to be open.

47
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,800
 We were so shit that we didn't even get the record that it's never been set before.

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,480
 Yeah, because a lot of people might not realize about the Guinness World Records is that you

49
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,680
 can't just be, I'm the first person to do this, and this is where I got up to.

50
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,560
 They set a bar of where the entry point for the record is, and I think it was ten slices.

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,920
 Wait a minute.

52
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,000
 I was the record holder on stage, however, right?

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,840
 I got like three or four slices.

54
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,880
 So that means I am a world record holder.

55
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,200
 I'm just not a Guinness World record holder.

56
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
 Yes.

57
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,280
 We need to make you a digital certificate.

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,680
 Who on earth would want a digital certificate?

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,120
 That's all I want to do.

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,080
 We might come to that later.

61
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,400
 Is it true that Craig then had to destroy the certificate?

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,120
 In theory, that's what he should have done.

63
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
 He ate it.

64
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
 Yes.

65
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
 Yeah.

66
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,560
 And he ate it in record time, I say.

67
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,760
 But he unfortunately didn't take off the plastic, and so that caused huge issues.

68
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,240
 No, I, uh, all sneaky Shriver here.

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,440
 I've got it in my house.

70
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,280
 How do you really, and illegal, and illegal Guinness World Record?

71
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,640
 As you say this, and the love's gone off and Guinness AQ, and a SWAT team has been dispatched

72
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,560
 to tear the house down if you have to.

73
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,520
 And the worst thing is that the world's best SWAT team.

74
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,080
 Um, done.

75
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
 Yeah.

76
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,920
 When he printed that certificate off, there was no name written on it, because he didn't

77
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,200
 know which of us was going to break the record.

78
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
 Yeah.

79
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,360
 Have you written your own name in there?

80
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,080
 No, I think it said no such thing as a fish.

81
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,600
 What I did do in Penn was add where it said they broke the record I added in did not.

82
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
 Very honest.

83
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
 Um, okay.

84
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
 Let's do another fact.

85
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
 Andy, what have you got for us?

86
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,800
 I've got a fact from Alex Rodgers, which is that Ben Nevis is the highest point in the

87
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,680
 British Isles, but it's only the third highest Ben Nevis.

88
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,280
 Oh, that's great.

89
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
 That's lovely.

90
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,320
 There are lots of other places around the world, at least two, that have been named

91
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,920
 after Ben Nevis and they're higher.

92
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
 Where are they?

93
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
 Australia.

94
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
 Oh, so close.

95
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,120
 You're about, I want to say it's so close to Australia.

96
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
 New Zealand.

97
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
 New Zealand.

98
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
 It's a lot of flight away.

99
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
 Yes.

100
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
 New Zealand.

101
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
 Right.

102
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
 Um, there's one that's 16, 19 meters.

103
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,360
 There's one that's over 2,000 meters and Ben Nevis original edition is only one, three,

104
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
 four, five.

105
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
 Wow.

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
 I've got Ben Nevis.

107
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
 How are you?

108
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
 Ben Nevis.

109
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
 No.

110
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,480
 It was on my honeymoon and me and my wife climbed it and we got a guide who took us up

111
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,240
 there, even though there's only one path and you can't really get lost.

112
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,080
 Still, still following me.

113
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,880
 Is he holding the umbrella all the way up?

114
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,520
 I don't really, I remember going online and some people saying, should we get a guide or

115
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
 not?

116
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,360
 And then some people are playing, yes, you should get a guide.

117
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,200
 But now I think back at it, maybe it was the guides who were right in those replies.

118
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
 Yeah.

119
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,680
 But now he was very good this person and gave us some energy bars to eat on the way up

120
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
 and stuff like that.

121
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,960
 And then took our photo when we got to the top.

122
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,600
 I've got to say, James, you could have taken a selfie stick and energy bar yourself.

123
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,200
 But I'm glad there are guides and actually people do get into difficulties.

124
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,520
 There are stories every single year of people going up, basically in flip flops and then

125
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,360
 it turns out, oh, the weather's turned really bad on this actually quite high mountain.

126
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
 Yeah.

127
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
 Yes.

128
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,400
 Well, James, did you see the piano?

129
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,560
 No, I didn't see a piano, but people have brought them up, have they?

130
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
 People have brought them up.

131
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,760
 Basically, in 2006, there were some litter pickers on Ben Nevis and they found a grand piano.

132
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,400
 They would go to a pile of litter, quite a big pile of litter.

133
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,960
 They had one of those long plastic sticks with a claw on the end going, I can't get a good

134
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
 grip on it.

135
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,920
 Yeah, basically, they found a massive grand piano, 200 metres from the summit.

136
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,080
 No one knows how he got there.

137
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,360
 There was someone who carried a piano up for charity in 1980, but he took his down

138
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
 again.

139
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,640
 So it's really baffling.

140
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,280
 There was a biscuit wrapper tucked inside, but it said best before 1986, but that doesn't

141
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,840
 really tell you very much.

142
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,120
 Well, it's a lovely idea, by the way, of having an achievable mountain that has the name

143
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,240
 of a very hard, like, you know, if there was a lesser amount Everest, that was really achievable

144
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,040
 that you could go, yeah, I've climbed that Everest.

145
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
 That was like, just in passing.

146
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,520
 It was like the time when I entered the Boston Marathon, to remember, and I was going

147
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,320
 to run the Boston Marathon, but it was just before COVID and I got cancelled, but I did

148
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,680
 the one in Boston in Lincolnshire because that is the, it's the easiest marathon in the

149
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,680
 UK because Lincolnshire is so flat.

150
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,560
 Oh, very nice.

151
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
 Okay.

152
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,920
 Here is a fact from Lindsey Wheeling, and Lindsey says that the length of the inch is based

153
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,600
 on the millimetre.

154
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
 What?

155
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:37,640
 But surely metric units are much newer than Imperial units.

156
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
 Yeah.

157
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,080
 An inch is 25.4 millimetres or something.

158
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
 Correct.

159
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,880
 Are you saying that they took the millimetre of this and well, let's have 25.4 of these?

160
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,640
 And that's exactly what I'm saying.

161
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
 No.

162
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,720
 It was the 1959 International Yard and Pound Agreement.

163
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,960
 And basically, all the different countries had different versions of the inch and they all

164
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,400
 got together in 1959 and said, look guys, we're going to have to standardize this.

165
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:17,080
 The US inch was 25.400508 millimetres, where the UK inch was 25.399977 millimetres.

166
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,400
 So if you had, if you measured something that was two and a bit miles long, the difference

167
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,640
 would be about a centimeter.

168
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,760
 So that could be very important.

169
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,160
 It's hard to imagine when, but like, let's say you're building a tunnel from New York to

170
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
 London.

171
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
 Yeah.

172
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,240
 And then the difference can be stopped.

173
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,720
 And you think, well, we've measured it.

174
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,480
 We've dug the distance we said we should.

175
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
 We're not.

176
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,780
 It sounds like there might be something on one centimeter away through that soil, but we're

177
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,780
 going to go home now.

178
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,780
 We're not going to.

179
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,780
 You wouldn't go home.

180
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,760
 You just keep digging and eventually you get there and you end up with two tunnels.

181
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
 Yeah.

182
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
 Okay.

183
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
 Done.

184
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
 Let's have another fact from you.

185
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
 Yes.

186
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,400
 Well, actually, I'm taking us back into the mountains.

187
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,280
 This is from Hayden Freeman, who says, as most people know, New Zealanders Sir Edmund

188
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,400
 Hillary was the first person to knock the bugger off and climb Mount Everest.

189
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,080
 But what few people will know is that fellow Kiwi Mark English was the first person to climb

190
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,600
 Mount Everest as a double amputee.

191
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
 Cool.

192
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
 Yeah.

193
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,560
 This is someone who's quite a notable mountaineer as written books and has been the subject

194
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,480
 of documentaries and so on.

195
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
 It's quite crazy.

196
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,720
 When he was climbing Everest, he actually broke one of the carbon fiber prosthetic legs

197
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,280
 in half.

198
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,480
 And so they had to temporarily fix it with duct tape while a spare was brought up from base

199
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,120
 camp to meet him so that he could swap it in.

200
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,120
 Gosh.

201
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
 Pretty wild.

202
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,440
 So New Zealanders quite have made quite an impact.

203
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
 Yeah.

204
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,640
 Well, they've had so much practice on the high Ben Nevis.

205
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,620
 I was going to say, when Edmund Hillary climbed Mount Everest, has anyone checked that

206
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,120
 he didn't actually climb a mountain called Mount Everest in New Zealand?

207
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,960
 I don't think that's been checked.

208
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
 That's a really good.

209
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,600
 It's a really good fight.

210
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
 Oh, dear.

211
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,720
 Andy, last one of them.

212
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:22,800
 Yes, this is a fact from Alistair Bowden and we're staying in the mountains.

213
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,440
 I don't think we've ever covered this.

214
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:32,280
 It's a fact set on Mount Athos, which is in Greece and it's that there's an 82 year old

215
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:41,480
 Greek monk, Mihailo Tolatos, who reportedly never saw a woman in his entire life because

216
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,720
 he was born to a woman and very sadly his mother died when he was just a few hours old and

217
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,040
 he didn't have any family.

218
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,080
 So he was taken to Mount Athos, this monastery, which is in Greece.

219
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:57,600
 It's quite remote and there are no women allowed and he lived 82 years.

220
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,760
 He died in 1938, I think, and the details are quite scanned, but it appears that he lived

221
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,600
 there his whole life and he just never saw a woman.

222
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
 Yeah.

223
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,040
 Also, he, allegedly, he never saw a car, a plane, or a film, right?

224
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,200
 Well, how did he not see a plane?

225
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,880
 They literally, Thessaloniki Airport is no more than 20 miles away from Mount Athos.

226
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,760
 But maybe he died in 1938, so maybe the last few years of his life, he was in doors and

227
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
 you know.

228
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,200
 It felt like he didn't see an iPad either, like it was born in 1856.

229
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,880
 So the first 40 odd years of his life, not seeing a plane, was an absolute sin.

230
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,880
 Or a car.

231
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
 Yeah.

232
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
 Or a film.

233
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,640
 I wouldn't include that on the list of the plane one, given that it hadn't existed for

234
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
 that long.

235
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,680
 And it existed for centuries before that.

236
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,440
 Okay, here's a really good one.

237
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,520
 So this is from you and Hopper.

238
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:54,600
 You and Rhodes was about the 1952 Texas gubernatorial election, which sounds unpromising, but the

239
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:02,000
 person who wanted that election was called Alan Shivers and Alan ran for both the democratic

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,880
 and the Republican parties in the same election.

241
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,160
 And the reason was that the Republicans knew that he was going to win, so there's no point

242
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,280
 putting anyone up against him, but they wanted to encourage people to vote for their candidate

243
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,960
 White Eisenhower as the president, and they thought that people might not go for a Democrat

244
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
 and a Republican.

245
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,320
 They might want to stay on party lines.

246
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,400
 So if they made Shivers a Republican as well, then they might just take Republican Shivers,

247
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
 Republican Eisenhower.

248
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,360
 Are they allowed to do that?

249
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
 Well, they did it.

250
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,200
 So I guess so.

251
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,200
 And Shivers got 1.8 million votes in total.

252
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:52,600
 1.3 million of them came to him as a Democrat and just in the 500,000 came to him as a Republican.

253
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:59,080
 And he also got 664 votes as a no party candidate.

254
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,160
 And that's where people wrote in about who they wanted to win, but didn't put the party

255
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
 in there.

256
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
 Right.

257
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
 Popular guy.

258
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
 Yeah.

259
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,760
 So yeah, 1.8 million votes.

260
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:17,560
 No preference got 36,672 votes, so 1.95% got no.

261
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
 That's not bad.

262
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,800
 It is, but the thing is with no preference, if you've got two options, and they're exactly

263
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,600
 the same, to me, no preference means I like them both equally, it doesn't mean I dislike

264
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
 them both equally.

265
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
 That's a good point.

266
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,520
 If it's Alan Shivers against Alan Shivers and you're saying, I don't have a preference.

267
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
 Exactly.

268
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
 Yeah, no one's got a preference mate.

269
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
 They're all Alan Shivers.

270
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,320
 That should have been 100% no preference, shouldn't it?

271
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
 But Texas law later removed that option.

272
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,320
 So now you don't have a chance to do no preference any more.

273
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
 I think that's possible.

274
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,320
 That's very funny.

275
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:57,400
 Alan Shivers, very popular, massive racist, said that segregation of black and white people

276
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,920
 was God's will and no law could supersede it.

277
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,360
 And he also said that being a communist should be punishable by death, and that being a communist

278
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,920
 was worse than murder.

279
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
 Right.

280
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,720
 I always enjoy it on fish where we have a really funny light-hearted chat about someone,

281
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:20,000
 the person who's got the information says, "Anyway, massive racist."

282
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,200
 Can I move this north of the border to Canada, for another fact?

283
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
 Yes, please.

284
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:35,120
 Julie Pithers and Julie writes, "Canadian scientists are currently collecting people's toenails.

285
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,600
 Thousands of them as well.

286
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:44,480
 Thousands and thousands of sets of toenails the Canadian scientists want for science.

287
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
 For science.

288
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,040
 They're going to be melting them down apparently.

289
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,680
 That's really cool.

290
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:58,360
 Basically, 20% of Canadians live in homes which have slightly unsafe levels of radon, which

291
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,800
 is a gas, it can cause cancer, and it occurs naturally as well.

292
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,080
 It's basically if you live in places which have uranium in the soil or the rocks, and it

293
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,080
 can break down.

294
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,880
 Normally, it's fine if you live out in the open, but most people don't live out in the open,

295
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,040
 most people live in homes, and if it's an enclosed base at a house, it can cause some

296
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
 damage.

297
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,240
 It's the same reason as why radiation levels are higher in coal mold than any else in the

298
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
 country.

299
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,240
 Exactly.

300
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,400
 There's a doctor called Aaron Goodazzi who's looking into this, trying to find the causes

301
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,080
 of lung cancer in high radon environments because it can cause lung cancer, which is very

302
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,080
 obviously very harmful.

303
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,880
 You need toenails because they're an archive of past exposure to radon.

304
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,080
 Your body takes in radon.

305
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,880
 It turns it into a kind of lead, and then it just sort of shoves it into the slowly shedding

306
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
 tissues.

307
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,680
 It's getting skin and hair and fingernails and toenails, and about 10,000 Canadians, I believe,

308
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,240
 have been recruited to test their homes of radon and then send in their clippings.

309
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
 Wow.

310
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
 Very good.

311
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
 Yeah.

312
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
 No, I read this the other day.

313
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,120
 Do you know what percentage of rocks contain uranium on earth?

314
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
 Is it all right?

315
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,720
 Are you going to be all of them or none of them?

316
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,720
 Do you mean percentage per rock or how many rocks globally?

317
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,600
 Okay. Well, interestingly, the percentage per rock is almost zero, and the percentage of

318
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,800
 rocks globally is almost 100%.

319
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
 Yes.

320
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,400
 So Adi was basically right on both of his two guesses.

321
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
 Nice.

322
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,840
 But yeah, because uranium is basically inside the earth, almost every single rock that you

323
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
 put.

324
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,880
 If you pick up a stone on the side of the road, it's probably got a tiny, tiny, tiny trace

325
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
 of uranium in it.

326
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
 God.

327
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
 Isn't that amazing?

328
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
 I don't know.

329
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
 That is really amazing.

330
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,600
 David Devonal Cornwall, you can put a detector in your home, which is about the size of a biscuit

331
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
 and test it.

332
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
 That's fun.

333
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
 Yeah.

334
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,240
 I would make it a size and shape of something that you don't eat.

335
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,800
 It's not shaped like a hobnob.

336
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
 I believe.

337
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
 I believe.

338
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,360
 It's got chocolate on one side.

339
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
 Okay.

340
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,320
 Well, that is enough of your facts.

341
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
 Absolutely brilliant.

342
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,600
 As every week, thank you so much to everyone who sent those in.

343
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,920
 And if you have a fat yourself, then do send it to podcast@QI.com, but we have not come to

344
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:16,120
 the end of this week's show because before we do that, we have to give out some facts.

345
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:22,560
 If you become a member of our patron at the friend of the podcast here, then you will immediately

346
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,040
 be assigned a fact.

347
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,640
 You will slightly less immediately be sent a certificate.

348
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,480
 And you might be even less immediately than that mentioned on the show, but we will

349
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
 get round to you all.

350
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,800
 And who is the first person we're getting round to today?

351
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 Andy.

352
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,440
 This one goes out to Kate Armstrong.

353
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
 Congratulations, Kate.

354
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,040
 Welcome to Friend of the podcast here.

355
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:50,160
 It's that Alexander the Great banned Beards in battle to combat beard pulling, which is

356
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,480
 apparently the scourge of the Macedonian.

357
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,200
 I wouldn't have thought it was a major problem, but you know, because you think once someone

358
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,500
 gets close enough to pull your beard, if you have a sword, you might have a way to stop

359
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
 them.

360
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,340
 Just toss off your beard.

361
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,340
 Yeah.

362
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
 Yeah.

363
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,340
 Yeah.

364
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,340
 Exactly.

365
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,340
 Yeah.

366
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,340
 But that was his innovation.

367
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,860
 And look, the guy was the terror of three continents or whatever.

368
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,540
 So I'm not going to gain, say, him.

369
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,540
 Well done, Alexander.

370
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,540
 Yeah.

371
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,980
 At the age of 30, he had no more wealth to conquer.

372
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,980
 Exactly.

373
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
 Exactly.

374
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,380
 So he probably knew what he was doing with the beard stuff.

375
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,580
 Dan, what have you got for us?

376
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,820
 This is a fact for Bo, congratulations, Bo.

377
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,940
 This is a fact of mine, which is that psychopaths don't experience contagious yawning like the

378
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,420
 rest of us.

379
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,600
 See, I know you're, I am now yawning, James, what James just yawning, I think it was a fake

380
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
 yawning.

381
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
 No, you know what?

382
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
 You know what?

383
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
 It started off.

384
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,140
 I did, I thought I'll do a fake one for comedic purposes.

385
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,900
 Not realizing that this is a podcast medium, and people won't be able to see that.

386
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,380
 But actually halfway through it turned into a real one.

387
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,380
 Well, there we go.

388
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,380
 Fake it till you make it.

389
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,380
 Very nice.

390
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,380
 Yeah.

391
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,740
 I experienced a lot of contagious yawning.

392
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,860
 In fact, I experienced yawning contagiously so much that I think I'm especially unusually empathetic.

393
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,860
 Yeah.

394
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,860
 Or just very tired.

395
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,860
 It's a bit of both.

396
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,860
 Yeah.

397
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,700
 It has happened a lot more since you had children.

398
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,700
 I have to say.

399
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,700
 That's true.

400
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,340
 Contators napping, it turns out, is also a real thing in meetings.

401
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,740
 And contagious meltdowns apparently.

402
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,740
 Shut up.

403
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,740
 Shut up.

404
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,660
 I can't quite remember where we got that fact from.

405
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:39,380
 It was either John Ronson who had ridden the psychopaths or it was Kevin, a professor called

406
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,380
 Kevin.

407
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,140
 So that's legit.

408
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,140
 Yes.

409
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:49,820
 He wrote a book on psychopaths and I once had dinner with Kevin along with Terry Jones of

410
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,820
 Monty Python.

411
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,820
 What a table.

412
00:19:51,820 --> 00:20:00,660
 And yeah, and he told me that he was working with Andy McNabb to train the England football

413
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,180
 squad to not change their decision or where they were kicking a penalty goal right at the

414
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,180
 last second.

415
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,820
 They were brought in as psychologists to say, make your decision and stick to it because

416
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,300
 apparently that was a problem within the squad.

417
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,140
 I'm sorry, Dan.

418
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,140
 Professor Kevin is working with Andy McNabb.

419
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,140
 Yes.

420
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,140
 Of the SAS.

421
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,140
 Thank you.

422
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,700
 To help the England football squad not change their decision on a penalty.

423
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,700
 Yes.

424
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
 And it's worked.

425
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,780
 Like when was the last time we lost a penalty shootout?

426
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,100
 It's a long time ago.

427
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,420
 You know when people say to you, like, what's your ideal dinner party?

428
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,420
 Yeah.

429
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:42,180
 I always say, Dan Schreiber, Terry Jones from Monty Python, Professor Kevin.

430
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,700
 That's, they're like three.

431
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,700
 But not McNabb.

432
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,700
 Oh, dear James.

433
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
 He's not going to be happy.

434
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,300
 He's not going to be bursting it through the windows halfway through the stasis.

435
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,340
 Well, he's got so many annoying things he needs to happen.

436
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,060
 He needs the room to be lit black where he's sitting so you can't see his face.

437
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,220
 He needs that vocoder thing so that he talks or not different, but he's a nightmare to have

438
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,540
 ever dinner.

439
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,100
 Interestingly, they didn't get to find out that World Cup, whether or not it worked because

440
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,860
 it never went to penalty shootouts.

441
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,180
 I think they lost it.

442
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,020
 They bravo to zero.

443
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,020
 Thank you.

444
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,020
 Thank you.

445
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,020
 I knew it, Nav's book.

446
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,020
 Very good.

447
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,020
 Nice.

448
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,020
 And it's Kevin Duttins.

449
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,020
 Just come back to me.

450
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,020
 Kevin Duttins.

451
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,020
 Kevin Duttins.

452
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
 Okay.

453
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,260
 Here is a fact that is now in the possession of Keith Baxter.

454
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:34,420
 Keith, your fact is that the big bang was quieter than a motorhead concert.

455
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,260
 Interestingly, Andy, you spelled motorhead without the omelette.

456
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,260
 That's not intentional.

457
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,740
 And I'm very sorry.

458
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,300
 We will have to get that certificate corrected.

459
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,300
 Kevin.

460
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,300
 Oh, Keith.

461
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,060
 That matter will have to get Keith, I know your name.

462
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,740
 I just spelled motorhead wrong.

463
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,740
 Oh, no.

464
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,980
 This is because it's all based off my ancient record keeping and sometimes.

465
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,860
 And in fairness, Andy, like your record keeping, like we use this spreadsheet in order to

466
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,300
 check that we haven't done facts before.

467
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,660
 And it would be correct to spell that without the omelette, I think, because I'm never

468
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,620
 going to search motorhead with an omelette.

469
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,620
 Oh, yes.

470
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,620
 Good point.

471
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,620
 So wait.

472
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,620
 The big bang was quieter than a motorhead concert.

473
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:21,900
 Motorhead 126 decibels and the big bang apparently 120 decibels, according to people who have studied

474
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,300
 the background radiation of the universe, it's insane that we, we know that or think we

475
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
 know that.

476
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,300
 Yeah.

477
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,820
 Let's go on to our next fact.

478
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,340
 So who's turn is it?

479
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,340
 It's mine.

480
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,100
 This one goes out to George Wade and it's a great one is that Pixar accidentally deleted

481
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,940
 Toy Story 2 halfway through making it.

482
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,940
 Fantastic.

483
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,620
 This was an Alex Bell fact.

484
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,620
 Yes.

485
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,180
 Basically, they deleted it.

486
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:52,500
 The only thing that remained was one person who got a maternity leave and she had a computer

487
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,780
 at home that was kind of separated from the rest of the system.

488
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:04,020
 And so I think they basically drove the computer in under extreme caution, like just strapped it

489
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,980
 in the back of a car or whatever and coveled it until it got in because that had almost

490
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,980
 everything on it.

491
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,940
 So yeah, so she had an early saved version.

492
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,940
 Yeah.

493
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,500
 And be able to do that these days, obviously, getting in touch with people on maternity leave

494
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,380
 is very much, you know, no, no.

495
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,460
 Toy Story 5 has ground to a halt for the next nine months.

496
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,220
 Dan, let's go on to the next one.

497
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,220
 Yeah.

498
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,900
 Well, we're moving on to episode 24.

499
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,260
 So that was that was episode 23 to all the custodians of the last four facts.

500
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,620
 And this one is for Ronnie.

501
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,900
 You are now the custodian of the fact that when he was bored, President Calvin Coolidge

502
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:45,860
 would ring a bell to summon bodyguards and then hide under the oval office desk.

503
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:51,340
 Was Coolidge the person who also, oh God, there was so many eccentric presidents that did

504
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,740
 very odd things in the White House, like the the shower head.

505
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,540
 Was that Coolidge or was that something else?

506
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,540
 He was LBJ.

507
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,540
 Was it?

508
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
 LBJ was, that's right.

509
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,580
 He had a shower head directed at his genital area.

510
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,580
 Yes.

511
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,580
 Yeah.

512
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,500
 Coolidge is the one who never said anything.

513
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,740
 He was very much the opposite of the current incumbent.

514
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,820
 He just never said, he just barely said three words.

515
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,460
 You know, there was, there's that story that someone went to dinner with him.

516
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,340
 So flotatious young woman, he said, oh, President Coolidge, I've, I've made it back with my friends

517
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,660
 that I could get you to say just three words tonight.

518
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,900
 And he just said to her, you lose nothing for the rest of the evening.

519
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,900
 Very good.

520
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
 Okay.

521
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,060
 The next fact comes from someone whose name could be made up of two US presidents, Andrew

522
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,380
 Jackson and Jimmy Carter because it's Andrew Carter.

523
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:48,100
 And your fact is that until 2011, the sun was only in theory, a sphere.

524
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,740
 Dan, this is yours.

525
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,740
 Yeah.

526
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:56,700
 I love this about science, whereas they knew it was a sphere because that by all indications

527
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
 is what it was.

528
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:03,900
 However, until two probes were sent around to either side of it, twin probes, they couldn't

529
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,460
 officially confirm that it was a sphere.

530
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,460
 And that's what this did.

531
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,260
 They said, it's confirmed.

532
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,260
 We've, we've seen it.

533
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,020
 We've actually seen it from the other side with two different probes.

534
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,820
 So I just, I just love that about science.

535
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,820
 I'll do one.

536
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,860
 This goes out to Erin Eldridge.

537
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:24,420
 Congratulations, Erin, your fact is that some birds nests contain over 100 rooms and

538
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,820
 weigh up to 1000 kilos and cause trees to collapse.

539
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,820
 Rubbish.

540
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,820
 It's true.

541
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,660
 100 rooms.

542
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:38,300
 This is a bird called the sociable weaver and it basically has these ginormous nests.

543
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,300
 Well, it needs them.

544
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,300
 It's so sociable.

545
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,300
 Yeah.

546
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,300
 These are for parties.

547
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,300
 It's like dancehouse.

548
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,300
 There's a description of this.

549
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,980
 How many kids does it have in there?

550
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,620
 Yeah, but it's very cool.

551
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,660
 I think I've seen pictures of them where they're absolutely ginormous and they're just

552
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,300
 a permanent sort of palace, amazing, and then last one for the day.

553
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:07,500
 The last one goes to Rohan Singh and this is a James Hark, in fact, it is the worst baseball

554
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,620
 team in South Korea has replaced its supporters with robots.

555
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,620
 Brilliant.

556
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,380
 Yeah, the Hanwha Eagles.

557
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:22,140
 They lost 400 games in the last five years and that's as of recording from 2015, I believe.

558
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,900
 And they are nicknamed the Hanwha chickens.

559
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,300
 So they've put up screens and you can put up your photo on the screen and you can do things

560
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,340
 like Mexican waves and chance along with it as you're watching the match.

561
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,020
 But yeah, Hark, do you remember more on this?

562
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,300
 No, I don't remember anything about them and I thought since we're doing this on Zoom,

563
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,420
 I can quickly check and see if they've won any games recently.

564
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,420
 Yes.

565
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:56,380
 But in 2025, they had a record of played 144, 183, so actually, yeah, they've improved quite

566
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,380
 a lot, I would say.

567
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,260
 Oh, well, there we go.

568
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,060
 So good old Hanwha Eagles.

569
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:07,020
 Anyway, so that is the end of the show.

570
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,620
 Thank you so much to everyone who sent a fact in.

571
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:17,900
 Thank you, especially to Rohan, Erin, Andrew, Ronnie, George, Keith, Bo, and Kate who are

572
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,220
 new custodians of facts in our friend of the podcast here.

576
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,740
 Lovely.

577
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,740
 Does that work?

578
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,740
 I haven't seen it.

579
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,940
