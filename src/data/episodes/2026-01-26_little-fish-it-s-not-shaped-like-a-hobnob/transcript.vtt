00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.920
 Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of Little Fish.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.000
 This is the show where we do away with our facts, the ones that we spent time looking

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 for.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.240
 And we look at your facts, your brilliant, excellent, amazing facts that you send to us every

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.840
 week at PodcastActQI.com.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.160
 We will read through them, we'll chat about them, we'll give you a little bit of extra

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.080
 information that we found ourselves and then we will go into our custodianship section

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.120
 where we hand out some facts to people who are in our friend of the podcast here on Patreon.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.840
 Anyway, without further ado, let's get into the facts, Dan, give us a fact.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.040
 Okay, this has been sent in by Fiona McDonald and she says, "I found out that cheese

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.240
 meltability is measured using a scale called the Schreiber scale."

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.240
 Lovely.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.240
 Fantastic.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.720
 I'll be honest, I haven't read the article in depth, but thought it sounded interesting.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.720
 It's very beautiful.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.720
 Very beautiful.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.720
 Thank you Fiona.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.720
 Cool.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.920
 Yeah, so this is, there was a company that was founded in 1945, which came to be known

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.800
 as Schreiber Foods and it was founded by a man called LD Schreiber in partnership with

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.400
 his friend Merlin.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.560
 Hello, just a first thing, German, are they?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.720
 No, no, they're North American, I believe.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.080
 I guess interesting to give your company a German name in 1945.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.200
 Yeah, well, they're massive, by the way.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.200
 Yeah, it's so big.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.200
 Big Jesus.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.880
 Big Jesus, they provide the cheese slices that are used on 17 of the top 20 hamburger chains

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.880
 in America.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.880
 Wow.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.440
 They are massive, $7 billion in sales every year.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.120
 They developed the Schreiber Meltability Test to monitor how cheese handles heats.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.720
 Did we have a live stage, cheese eating competition with each other?

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.720
 We did.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.720
 We did.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.120
 We did it for the most cheese slices eaten in something like a minute.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.240
 I set up, while we were on tour, a chance for us to get a Guinness World record and Craig

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.640
 Glenday, editor-in-chief, came on to stage, pre-printed a certificate in case we managed it.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.760
 And the four of us tried to eat as many slices.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.960
 Now, it was an impossible task, I would argue.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.400
 I don't think even the greatest cheesy to could manage it.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.920
 No, no, no, no.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.640
 The greatest cheesy to cod manage it, that's the thing about the records.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.640
 This isn't a record.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.640
 No one has ever set it.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.640
 I was going to be open.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.800
 We were so shit that we didn't even get the record that it's never been set before.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.480
 Yeah, because a lot of people might not realize about the Guinness World Records is that you

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.680
 can't just be, I'm the first person to do this, and this is where I got up to.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.560
 They set a bar of where the entry point for the record is, and I think it was ten slices.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.920
 Wait a minute.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.000
 I was the record holder on stage, however, right?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.840
 I got like three or four slices.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.880
 So that means I am a world record holder.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.200
 I'm just not a Guinness World record holder.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.200
 Yes.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.280
 We need to make you a digital certificate.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.680
 Who on earth would want a digital certificate?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.120
 That's all I want to do.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.080
 We might come to that later.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.400
 Is it true that Craig then had to destroy the certificate?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.120
 In theory, that's what he should have done.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.120
 He ate it.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.120
 Yes.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.120
 Yeah.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.560
 And he ate it in record time, I say.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.760
 But he unfortunately didn't take off the plastic, and so that caused huge issues.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.240
 No, I, uh, all sneaky Shriver here.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.440
 I've got it in my house.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.280
 How do you really, and illegal, and illegal Guinness World Record?

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.640
 As you say this, and the love's gone off and Guinness AQ, and a SWAT team has been dispatched

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.560
 to tear the house down if you have to.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.520
 And the worst thing is that the world's best SWAT team.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.080
 Um, done.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.080
 Yeah.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.920
 When he printed that certificate off, there was no name written on it, because he didn't

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.200
 know which of us was going to break the record.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.200
 Yeah.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.360
 Have you written your own name in there?

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.080
 No, I think it said no such thing as a fish.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.600
 What I did do in Penn was add where it said they broke the record I added in did not.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.600
 Very honest.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600
 Um, okay.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600
 Let's do another fact.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.600
 Andy, what have you got for us?

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.800
 I've got a fact from Alex Rodgers, which is that Ben Nevis is the highest point in the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.680
 British Isles, but it's only the third highest Ben Nevis.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.280
 Oh, that's great.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.280
 That's lovely.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.320
 There are lots of other places around the world, at least two, that have been named

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.920
 after Ben Nevis and they're higher.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.920
 Where are they?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.920
 Australia.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.920
 Oh, so close.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.120
 You're about, I want to say it's so close to Australia.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.120
 New Zealand.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.120
 New Zealand.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.120
 It's a lot of flight away.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.120
 Yes.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.120
 New Zealand.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.120
 Right.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.120
 Um, there's one that's 16, 19 meters.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.360
 There's one that's over 2,000 meters and Ben Nevis original edition is only one, three,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.360
 four, five.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.360
 Wow.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.360
 I've got Ben Nevis.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.360
 How are you?

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.360
 Ben Nevis.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.360
 No.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.480
 It was on my honeymoon and me and my wife climbed it and we got a guide who took us up

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.240
 there, even though there's only one path and you can't really get lost.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.080
 Still, still following me.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.880
 Is he holding the umbrella all the way up?

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.520
 I don't really, I remember going online and some people saying, should we get a guide or

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.520
 not?

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.360
 And then some people are playing, yes, you should get a guide.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.200
 But now I think back at it, maybe it was the guides who were right in those replies.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.200
 Yeah.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.680
 But now he was very good this person and gave us some energy bars to eat on the way up

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.680
 and stuff like that.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.960
 And then took our photo when we got to the top.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.600
 I've got to say, James, you could have taken a selfie stick and energy bar yourself.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.200
 But I'm glad there are guides and actually people do get into difficulties.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.520
 There are stories every single year of people going up, basically in flip flops and then

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.360
 it turns out, oh, the weather's turned really bad on this actually quite high mountain.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.360
 Yeah.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.360
 Yes.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.400
 Well, James, did you see the piano?

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.560
 No, I didn't see a piano, but people have brought them up, have they?

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.560
 People have brought them up.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.760
 Basically, in 2006, there were some litter pickers on Ben Nevis and they found a grand piano.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.400
 They would go to a pile of litter, quite a big pile of litter.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.960
 They had one of those long plastic sticks with a claw on the end going, I can't get a good

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.960
 grip on it.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.920
 Yeah, basically, they found a massive grand piano, 200 metres from the summit.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.080
 No one knows how he got there.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.360
 There was someone who carried a piano up for charity in 1980, but he took his down

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.360
 again.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.640
 So it's really baffling.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.280
 There was a biscuit wrapper tucked inside, but it said best before 1986, but that doesn't

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.840
 really tell you very much.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.120
 Well, it's a lovely idea, by the way, of having an achievable mountain that has the name

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.240
 of a very hard, like, you know, if there was a lesser amount Everest, that was really achievable

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.040
 that you could go, yeah, I've climbed that Everest.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.040
 That was like, just in passing.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.520
 It was like the time when I entered the Boston Marathon, to remember, and I was going

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.320
 to run the Boston Marathon, but it was just before COVID and I got cancelled, but I did

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.680
 the one in Boston in Lincolnshire because that is the, it's the easiest marathon in the

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.680
 UK because Lincolnshire is so flat.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.560
 Oh, very nice.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.560
 Okay.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:27.920
 Here is a fact from Lindsey Wheeling, and Lindsey says that the length of the inch is based

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.600
 on the millimetre.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.600
 What?

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:37.640
 But surely metric units are much newer than Imperial units.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.640
 Yeah.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.080
 An inch is 25.4 millimetres or something.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.080
 Correct.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.880
 Are you saying that they took the millimetre of this and well, let's have 25.4 of these?

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.640
 And that's exactly what I'm saying.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.640
 No.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.720
 It was the 1959 International Yard and Pound Agreement.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:58.960
 And basically, all the different countries had different versions of the inch and they all

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:04.400
 got together in 1959 and said, look guys, we're going to have to standardize this.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:17.080
 The US inch was 25.400508 millimetres, where the UK inch was 25.399977 millimetres.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.400
 So if you had, if you measured something that was two and a bit miles long, the difference

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.640
 would be about a centimeter.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.760
 So that could be very important.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:32.160
 It's hard to imagine when, but like, let's say you're building a tunnel from New York to

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.160
 London.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.160
 Yeah.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.240
 And then the difference can be stopped.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.720
 And you think, well, we've measured it.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.480
 We've dug the distance we said we should.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.480
 We're not.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.780
 It sounds like there might be something on one centimeter away through that soil, but we're

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.780
 going to go home now.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.780
 We're not going to.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.780
 You wouldn't go home.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.760
 You just keep digging and eventually you get there and you end up with two tunnels.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.760
 Yeah.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.760
 Okay.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.760
 Done.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.760
 Let's have another fact from you.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.760
 Yes.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.400
 Well, actually, I'm taking us back into the mountains.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.280
 This is from Hayden Freeman, who says, as most people know, New Zealanders Sir Edmund

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.400
 Hillary was the first person to knock the bugger off and climb Mount Everest.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.080
 But what few people will know is that fellow Kiwi Mark English was the first person to climb

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.600
 Mount Everest as a double amputee.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.600
 Cool.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.600
 Yeah.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:26.560
 This is someone who's quite a notable mountaineer as written books and has been the subject

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.480
 of documentaries and so on.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.480
 It's quite crazy.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:35.720
 When he was climbing Everest, he actually broke one of the carbon fiber prosthetic legs

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.280
 in half.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.480
 And so they had to temporarily fix it with duct tape while a spare was brought up from base

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.120
 camp to meet him so that he could swap it in.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.120
 Gosh.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.120
 Pretty wild.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.440
 So New Zealanders quite have made quite an impact.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.440
 Yeah.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.640
 Well, they've had so much practice on the high Ben Nevis.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.620
 I was going to say, when Edmund Hillary climbed Mount Everest, has anyone checked that

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.120
 he didn't actually climb a mountain called Mount Everest in New Zealand?

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.960
 I don't think that's been checked.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.960
 That's a really good.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.600
 It's a really good fight.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.600
 Oh, dear.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.720
 Andy, last one of them.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:22.800
 Yes, this is a fact from Alistair Bowden and we're staying in the mountains.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.440
 I don't think we've ever covered this.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:32.280
 It's a fact set on Mount Athos, which is in Greece and it's that there's an 82 year old

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:41.480
 Greek monk, Mihailo Tolatos, who reportedly never saw a woman in his entire life because

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.720
 he was born to a woman and very sadly his mother died when he was just a few hours old and

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.040
 he didn't have any family.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.080
 So he was taken to Mount Athos, this monastery, which is in Greece.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:57.600
 It's quite remote and there are no women allowed and he lived 82 years.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.760
 He died in 1938, I think, and the details are quite scanned, but it appears that he lived

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.600
 there his whole life and he just never saw a woman.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.600
 Yeah.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.040
 Also, he, allegedly, he never saw a car, a plane, or a film, right?

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.200
 Well, how did he not see a plane?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.880
 They literally, Thessaloniki Airport is no more than 20 miles away from Mount Athos.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.760
 But maybe he died in 1938, so maybe the last few years of his life, he was in doors and

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.760
 you know.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:27.200
 It felt like he didn't see an iPad either, like it was born in 1856.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.880
 So the first 40 odd years of his life, not seeing a plane, was an absolute sin.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.880
 Or a car.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.880
 Yeah.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.880
 Or a film.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.640
 I wouldn't include that on the list of the plane one, given that it hadn't existed for

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.640
 that long.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.680
 And it existed for centuries before that.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.440
 Okay, here's a really good one.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.520
 So this is from you and Hopper.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:54.600
 You and Rhodes was about the 1952 Texas gubernatorial election, which sounds unpromising, but the

00:11:54.600 --> 00:12:02.000
 person who wanted that election was called Alan Shivers and Alan ran for both the democratic

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.880
 and the Republican parties in the same election.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:11.160
 And the reason was that the Republicans knew that he was going to win, so there's no point

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.280
 putting anyone up against him, but they wanted to encourage people to vote for their candidate

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:22.960
 White Eisenhower as the president, and they thought that people might not go for a Democrat

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.960
 and a Republican.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.320
 They might want to stay on party lines.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:33.400
 So if they made Shivers a Republican as well, then they might just take Republican Shivers,

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400
 Republican Eisenhower.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.360
 Are they allowed to do that?

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360
 Well, they did it.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.200
 So I guess so.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.200
 And Shivers got 1.8 million votes in total.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:52.600
 1.3 million of them came to him as a Democrat and just in the 500,000 came to him as a Republican.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:59.080
 And he also got 664 votes as a no party candidate.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:04.160
 And that's where people wrote in about who they wanted to win, but didn't put the party

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.160
 in there.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160
 Right.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.160
 Popular guy.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.160
 Yeah.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.760
 So yeah, 1.8 million votes.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:17.560
 No preference got 36,672 votes, so 1.95% got no.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.560
 That's not bad.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.800
 It is, but the thing is with no preference, if you've got two options, and they're exactly

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.600
 the same, to me, no preference means I like them both equally, it doesn't mean I dislike

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.600
 them both equally.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.600
 That's a good point.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.520
 If it's Alan Shivers against Alan Shivers and you're saying, I don't have a preference.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520
 Exactly.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.520
 Yeah, no one's got a preference mate.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.520
 They're all Alan Shivers.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.320
 That should have been 100% no preference, shouldn't it?

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.240
 But Texas law later removed that option.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.320
 So now you don't have a chance to do no preference any more.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.320
 I think that's possible.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.320
 That's very funny.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:57.400
 Alan Shivers, very popular, massive racist, said that segregation of black and white people

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.920
 was God's will and no law could supersede it.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.360
 And he also said that being a communist should be punishable by death, and that being a communist

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.920
 was worse than murder.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.920
 Right.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.720
 I always enjoy it on fish where we have a really funny light-hearted chat about someone,

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:20.000
 the person who's got the information says, "Anyway, massive racist."

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.200
 Can I move this north of the border to Canada, for another fact?

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.200
 Yes, please.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:35.120
 Julie Pithers and Julie writes, "Canadian scientists are currently collecting people's toenails.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.600
 Thousands of them as well.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:44.480
 Thousands and thousands of sets of toenails the Canadian scientists want for science.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.480
 For science.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.040
 They're going to be melting them down apparently.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.680
 That's really cool.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:58.360
 Basically, 20% of Canadians live in homes which have slightly unsafe levels of radon, which

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.800
 is a gas, it can cause cancer, and it occurs naturally as well.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.080
 It's basically if you live in places which have uranium in the soil or the rocks, and it

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.080
 can break down.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.880
 Normally, it's fine if you live out in the open, but most people don't live out in the open,

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.040
 most people live in homes, and if it's an enclosed base at a house, it can cause some

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.040
 damage.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.240
 It's the same reason as why radiation levels are higher in coal mold than any else in the

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.240
 country.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.240
 Exactly.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.400
 There's a doctor called Aaron Goodazzi who's looking into this, trying to find the causes

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.080
 of lung cancer in high radon environments because it can cause lung cancer, which is very

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.080
 obviously very harmful.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.880
 You need toenails because they're an archive of past exposure to radon.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.080
 Your body takes in radon.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.880
 It turns it into a kind of lead, and then it just sort of shoves it into the slowly shedding

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.880
 tissues.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:50.680
 It's getting skin and hair and fingernails and toenails, and about 10,000 Canadians, I believe,

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:54.240
 have been recruited to test their homes of radon and then send in their clippings.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.240
 Wow.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.240
 Very good.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.240
 Yeah.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.240
 No, I read this the other day.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.120
 Do you know what percentage of rocks contain uranium on earth?

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.120
 Is it all right?

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.720
 Are you going to be all of them or none of them?

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.720
 Do you mean percentage per rock or how many rocks globally?

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:15.600
 Okay. Well, interestingly, the percentage per rock is almost zero, and the percentage of

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.800
 rocks globally is almost 100%.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.800
 Yes.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.400
 So Adi was basically right on both of his two guesses.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.400
 Nice.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.840
 But yeah, because uranium is basically inside the earth, almost every single rock that you

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.840
 put.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.880
 If you pick up a stone on the side of the road, it's probably got a tiny, tiny, tiny trace

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.880
 of uranium in it.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.880
 God.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.880
 Isn't that amazing?

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.880
 I don't know.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.880
 That is really amazing.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.600
 David Devonal Cornwall, you can put a detector in your home, which is about the size of a biscuit

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.600
 and test it.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.600
 That's fun.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.600
 Yeah.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.240
 I would make it a size and shape of something that you don't eat.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.800
 It's not shaped like a hobnob.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.800
 I believe.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.800
 I believe.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.360
 It's got chocolate on one side.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.360
 Okay.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.320
 Well, that is enough of your facts.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.320
 Absolutely brilliant.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.600
 As every week, thank you so much to everyone who sent those in.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:09.920
 And if you have a fat yourself, then do send it to podcast@QI.com, but we have not come to

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:16.120
 the end of this week's show because before we do that, we have to give out some facts.

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:22.560
 If you become a member of our patron at the friend of the podcast here, then you will immediately

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.040
 be assigned a fact.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.640
 You will slightly less immediately be sent a certificate.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.480
 And you might be even less immediately than that mentioned on the show, but we will

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.480
 get round to you all.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.800
 And who is the first person we're getting round to today?

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.800
 Andy.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.440
 This one goes out to Kate Armstrong.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440
 Congratulations, Kate.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.040
 Welcome to Friend of the podcast here.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:50.160
 It's that Alexander the Great banned Beards in battle to combat beard pulling, which is

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.480
 apparently the scourge of the Macedonian.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.200
 I wouldn't have thought it was a major problem, but you know, because you think once someone

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.500
 gets close enough to pull your beard, if you have a sword, you might have a way to stop

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.500
 them.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.340
 Just toss off your beard.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:05.340
 Yeah.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.340
 Yeah.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.340
 Yeah.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.340
 Exactly.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.340
 Yeah.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.340
 But that was his innovation.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.860
 And look, the guy was the terror of three continents or whatever.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.540
 So I'm not going to gain, say, him.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.540
 Well done, Alexander.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.540
 Yeah.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.980
 At the age of 30, he had no more wealth to conquer.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.980
 Exactly.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:21.980
 Exactly.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.380
 So he probably knew what he was doing with the beard stuff.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.580
 Dan, what have you got for us?

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.820
 This is a fact for Bo, congratulations, Bo.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:36.940
 This is a fact of mine, which is that psychopaths don't experience contagious yawning like the

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.420
 rest of us.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.600
 See, I know you're, I am now yawning, James, what James just yawning, I think it was a fake

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.600
 yawning.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.600
 No, you know what?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.600
 You know what?

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.600
 It started off.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.140
 I did, I thought I'll do a fake one for comedic purposes.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.900
 Not realizing that this is a podcast medium, and people won't be able to see that.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.380
 But actually halfway through it turned into a real one.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.380
 Well, there we go.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.380
 Fake it till you make it.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.380
 Very nice.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.380
 Yeah.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.740
 I experienced a lot of contagious yawning.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.860
 In fact, I experienced yawning contagiously so much that I think I'm especially unusually empathetic.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:09.860
 Yeah.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:10.860
 Or just very tired.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.860
 It's a bit of both.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.860
 Yeah.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.700
 It has happened a lot more since you had children.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.700
 I have to say.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.700
 That's true.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:24.340
 Contators napping, it turns out, is also a real thing in meetings.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.740
 And contagious meltdowns apparently.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.740
 Shut up.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:28.740
 Shut up.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.660
 I can't quite remember where we got that fact from.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:39.380
 It was either John Ronson who had ridden the psychopaths or it was Kevin, a professor called

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.380
 Kevin.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.140
 So that's legit.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.140
 Yes.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:49.820
 He wrote a book on psychopaths and I once had dinner with Kevin along with Terry Jones of

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.820
 Monty Python.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.820
 What a table.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:20:00.660
 And yeah, and he told me that he was working with Andy McNabb to train the England football

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.180
 squad to not change their decision or where they were kicking a penalty goal right at the

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.180
 last second.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.820
 They were brought in as psychologists to say, make your decision and stick to it because

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.300
 apparently that was a problem within the squad.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.140
 I'm sorry, Dan.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.140
 Professor Kevin is working with Andy McNabb.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.140
 Yes.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.140
 Of the SAS.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.140
 Thank you.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.700
 To help the England football squad not change their decision on a penalty.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.700
 Yes.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.700
 And it's worked.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.780
 Like when was the last time we lost a penalty shootout?

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.100
 It's a long time ago.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.420
 You know when people say to you, like, what's your ideal dinner party?

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.420
 Yeah.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:42.180
 I always say, Dan Schreiber, Terry Jones from Monty Python, Professor Kevin.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.700
 That's, they're like three.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.700
 But not McNabb.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.700
 Oh, dear James.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.700
 He's not going to be happy.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.300
 He's not going to be bursting it through the windows halfway through the stasis.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.340
 Well, he's got so many annoying things he needs to happen.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.060
 He needs the room to be lit black where he's sitting so you can't see his face.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.220
 He needs that vocoder thing so that he talks or not different, but he's a nightmare to have

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.540
 ever dinner.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:10.100
 Interestingly, they didn't get to find out that World Cup, whether or not it worked because

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.860
 it never went to penalty shootouts.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.180
 I think they lost it.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.020
 They bravo to zero.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.020
 Thank you.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.020
 Thank you.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.020
 I knew it, Nav's book.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.020
 Very good.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.020
 Nice.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.020
 And it's Kevin Duttins.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.020
 Just come back to me.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.020
 Kevin Duttins.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.020
 Kevin Duttins.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.020
 Okay.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.260
 Here is a fact that is now in the possession of Keith Baxter.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:34.420
 Keith, your fact is that the big bang was quieter than a motorhead concert.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:39.260
 Interestingly, Andy, you spelled motorhead without the omelette.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.260
 That's not intentional.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.740
 And I'm very sorry.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.300
 We will have to get that certificate corrected.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.300
 Kevin.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.300
 Oh, Keith.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.060
 That matter will have to get Keith, I know your name.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.740
 I just spelled motorhead wrong.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.740
 Oh, no.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.980
 This is because it's all based off my ancient record keeping and sometimes.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:01.860
 And in fairness, Andy, like your record keeping, like we use this spreadsheet in order to

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.300
 check that we haven't done facts before.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.660
 And it would be correct to spell that without the omelette, I think, because I'm never

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.620
 going to search motorhead with an omelette.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.620
 Oh, yes.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:12.620
 Good point.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.620
 So wait.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.620
 The big bang was quieter than a motorhead concert.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:21.900
 Motorhead 126 decibels and the big bang apparently 120 decibels, according to people who have studied

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:27.300
 the background radiation of the universe, it's insane that we, we know that or think we

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.300
 know that.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.300
 Yeah.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.820
 Let's go on to our next fact.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.340
 So who's turn is it?

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.340
 It's mine.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:39.100
 This one goes out to George Wade and it's a great one is that Pixar accidentally deleted

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.940
 Toy Story 2 halfway through making it.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:42.940
 Fantastic.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.620
 This was an Alex Bell fact.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.620
 Yes.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.180
 Basically, they deleted it.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:52.500
 The only thing that remained was one person who got a maternity leave and she had a computer

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.780
 at home that was kind of separated from the rest of the system.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:23:04.020
 And so I think they basically drove the computer in under extreme caution, like just strapped it

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.980
 in the back of a car or whatever and coveled it until it got in because that had almost

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:08.980
 everything on it.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.940
 So yeah, so she had an early saved version.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:11.940
 Yeah.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.500
 And be able to do that these days, obviously, getting in touch with people on maternity leave

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.380
 is very much, you know, no, no.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:24.460
 Toy Story 5 has ground to a halt for the next nine months.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.220
 Dan, let's go on to the next one.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.220
 Yeah.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.900
 Well, we're moving on to episode 24.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.260
 So that was that was episode 23 to all the custodians of the last four facts.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.620
 And this one is for Ronnie.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.900
 You are now the custodian of the fact that when he was bored, President Calvin Coolidge

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:45.860
 would ring a bell to summon bodyguards and then hide under the oval office desk.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:51.340
 Was Coolidge the person who also, oh God, there was so many eccentric presidents that did

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.740
 very odd things in the White House, like the the shower head.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.540
 Was that Coolidge or was that something else?

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.540
 He was LBJ.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.540
 Was it?

00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.540
 LBJ was, that's right.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.580
 He had a shower head directed at his genital area.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:04.580
 Yes.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.580
 Yeah.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.500
 Coolidge is the one who never said anything.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.740
 He was very much the opposite of the current incumbent.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.820
 He just never said, he just barely said three words.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.460
 You know, there was, there's that story that someone went to dinner with him.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:21.340
 So flotatious young woman, he said, oh, President Coolidge, I've, I've made it back with my friends

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.660
 that I could get you to say just three words tonight.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.900
 And he just said to her, you lose nothing for the rest of the evening.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.900
 Very good.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.900
 Okay.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:37.060
 The next fact comes from someone whose name could be made up of two US presidents, Andrew

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:41.380
 Jackson and Jimmy Carter because it's Andrew Carter.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:48.100
 And your fact is that until 2011, the sun was only in theory, a sphere.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.740
 Dan, this is yours.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.740
 Yeah.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:56.700
 I love this about science, whereas they knew it was a sphere because that by all indications

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.700
 is what it was.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:03.900
 However, until two probes were sent around to either side of it, twin probes, they couldn't

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.460
 officially confirm that it was a sphere.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.460
 And that's what this did.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.260
 They said, it's confirmed.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.260
 We've, we've seen it.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.020
 We've actually seen it from the other side with two different probes.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.820
 So I just, I just love that about science.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.820
 I'll do one.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.860
 This goes out to Erin Eldridge.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:24.420
 Congratulations, Erin, your fact is that some birds nests contain over 100 rooms and

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:28.820
 weigh up to 1000 kilos and cause trees to collapse.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:29.820
 Rubbish.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:30.820
 It's true.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.660
 100 rooms.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:38.300
 This is a bird called the sociable weaver and it basically has these ginormous nests.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.300
 Well, it needs them.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.300
 It's so sociable.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.300
 Yeah.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.300
 These are for parties.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.300
 It's like dancehouse.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.300
 There's a description of this.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.980
 How many kids does it have in there?

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.620
 Yeah, but it's very cool.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.660
 I think I've seen pictures of them where they're absolutely ginormous and they're just

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:01.300
 a permanent sort of palace, amazing, and then last one for the day.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:07.500
 The last one goes to Rohan Singh and this is a James Hark, in fact, it is the worst baseball

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.620
 team in South Korea has replaced its supporters with robots.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.620
 Brilliant.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:15.380
 Yeah, the Hanwha Eagles.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:22.140
 They lost 400 games in the last five years and that's as of recording from 2015, I believe.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.900
 And they are nicknamed the Hanwha chickens.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.300
 So they've put up screens and you can put up your photo on the screen and you can do things

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:33.340
 like Mexican waves and chance along with it as you're watching the match.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.020
 But yeah, Hark, do you remember more on this?

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.300
 No, I don't remember anything about them and I thought since we're doing this on Zoom,

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:42.420
 I can quickly check and see if they've won any games recently.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.420
 Yes.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:56.380
 But in 2025, they had a record of played 144, 183, so actually, yeah, they've improved quite

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.380
 a lot, I would say.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:59.260
 Oh, well, there we go.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.060
 So good old Hanwha Eagles.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:07.020
 Anyway, so that is the end of the show.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.620
 Thank you so much to everyone who sent a fact in.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:17.900
 Thank you, especially to Rohan, Erin, Andrew, Ronnie, George, Keith, Bo, and Kate who are

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.220
 new custodians of facts in our friend of the podcast here.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:27.860
 And if you would like to do that yourself, go to patreon.com/nosuchthingsofish and you'll

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.500
 find details of how to join our many tiers.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:36.740
 We have more tiers than a cinema at the end of Toy Story 2.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.740
 Lovely.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.740
 Does that work?

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.740
 I haven't seen it.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.940
 Well, you can find everything on there and more.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:47.300
 And if you'd like to hear more from us, then come back on Friday when we will have a regular

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:51.660
 episode of No Such Things A Fish in the meantime, it's good bye from me, it's good bye from

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:56.860
 Andy, boy, and it's good bye from Dan so long, just trying to do my audition for university

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:57.860
 challenge.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.580
 Bye.
