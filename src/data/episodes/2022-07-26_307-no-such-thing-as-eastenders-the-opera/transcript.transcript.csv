00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hey everyone, before we begin this week's episode of Fish, we just want to let you know something hugely exciting."
00:00:05,00:00:09,One of us has our first debut novel out this week.
00:00:09,00:00:12,That is correct. Which one could it be?
00:00:12,00:00:14,Andrew Hunter Murray. It's Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:00:14,00:00:15,"Oh, it's that guy."
00:00:15,00:00:19,It's that guy. He has written a debut thriller novel. It's called The Last Day.
00:00:19,00:00:22,I've read it. It's unbelievably good.
00:00:22,00:00:29,It's really great. So it's kind of this sci-fi dystopian future where the world has gradually stopped.
00:00:29,00:00:33,"Spinning. Half of it's plunged into darkness, half of it's bathed in light."
00:00:33,00:00:37,It's impossible to live in any of those areas. But what about the middle sliver?
00:00:37,00:00:39,"It's sort of half light, half dark."
00:00:39,00:00:41,That's where the novel takes place.
00:00:41,00:00:44,"It's wonderful, boldly imagined and beautifully written."
00:00:44,00:00:46,The best future shock thriller for years.
00:00:46,00:00:49,Those aren't my words. There's a Lee Child's words.
00:00:49,00:00:52,"Lee Child. And look, I know a lot of people respect Lee Child's view,"
00:00:52,00:00:55,but my view may be even more important to some.
00:00:55,00:00:59,"And genuinely, couldn't believe it, Andy, can actually write incredibly well."
00:00:59,00:01:00,Absolutely. It's a stunning original thriller.
00:01:00,00:01:04,It's set in a world of tomorrow that make you think about what's happening today.
00:01:04,00:01:06,Not my words. Harlan Coben.
00:01:06,00:01:08,Harlan Coben said that about Andy.
00:01:08,00:01:11,You may be beginning to think that Dan has no words of his own.
00:01:11,00:01:14,And even more exciting news is that you can actually buy this book.
00:01:14,00:01:20,"It's available to buy in what we call bookshops, all of them, or on the internet."
00:01:20,00:01:23,"And if you want to listen to it, there's an audiobook available."
00:01:23,00:01:26,And it's narrated by Gemma Wheelan of Game of Thrones.
00:01:26,00:01:28,"If that's not a mark of quality, I don't know what it is."
00:01:28,00:01:31,"Go get it, buy it, read it, listen to it, do it now."
00:01:31,00:01:35,"That's right. The last day by Andrew Hunter Murray, a fabulous achievement."
00:01:35,00:01:37,Not my words. Steven Fry.
00:01:37,00:01:38,"Oh, Jesus Christ."
00:01:38,00:01:39,Okay.
00:01:39,00:01:39,On with the show.
00:01:54,00:01:59,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:01:59,00:02:02,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:02:02,00:02:03,My name is Dan Shriver.
00:02:03,00:02:08,"I am sitting here with James Hartkin, Anna Chazinski, and Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:02:08,00:02:12,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:02:12,00:02:13,from the last seven days.
00:02:13,00:02:16,"And in a particular order, here, we go."
00:02:16,00:02:18,"Starting with you, Chazinski."
00:02:18,00:02:23,My fact this week is that after being stuck at an opera that went on
00:02:23,00:02:29,"twice as long as the scheduled running time, Emperor Joseph II of Austria banned on course."
00:02:29,00:02:33,"So yeah, this was 1786."
00:02:33,00:02:35,It was the marriage of Figaro.
00:02:35,00:02:36,Very good.
00:02:36,00:02:37,No disrespect to that.
00:02:37,00:02:41,"I'm sure he emphasized, but it did go on twice the length it was supposed to,"
00:02:41,00:02:44,because almost every single scene was on-cord.
00:02:44,00:02:45,That's so funny.
00:02:45,00:02:46,It's rough.
00:02:46,00:02:49,"If you've got kids to get home to, it's difficult."
00:02:49,00:02:49,Yep.
00:02:49,00:02:52,"So anyway, he went, the emperor went, and he thought that was fine,"
00:02:52,00:02:57,but he immediately afterwards set put up kind of bills in theaters saying that
00:02:57,00:03:00,no piece of music should be on-cord henceforth.
00:03:00,00:03:04,"And to be clear, he said no piece of music for more than a single voice."
00:03:04,00:03:08,"So if you are singing your solitary little solo, you can maybe get away with it,"
00:03:08,00:03:10,but basically you couldn't do anything else.
00:03:10,00:03:13,"It's an amazing thing, the idea of an on-cord mid-show,"
00:03:13,00:03:15,or even at the beginning of the show and just carrying on.
00:03:15,00:03:16,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:03:16,00:03:17,I've never heard of that before.
00:03:17,00:03:19,They just used to interrupt shows.
00:03:19,00:03:23,"I mean, this was how on-cords worked until apparently up to the 1930s."
00:03:23,00:03:24,"In theatre, it was common."
00:03:24,00:03:26,"Like, if you were watching a scene and you liked it,"
00:03:26,00:03:29,"you'd just shout on-cord and continuity couldn't happen,"
00:03:29,00:03:31,because you'd have to do the scene again.
00:03:31,00:03:34,Sometimes there'd be like a song that audience really liked sort of in scene two.
00:03:34,00:03:38,"And then an hour later, they decide to on-cord that song from scene two,"
00:03:38,00:03:40,"and they'd be like, ""Hey, play, hit me baby again."""
00:03:40,00:03:42,And you'd have to go back.
00:03:42,00:03:44,What's hit me baby is that Britney Spears opera?
00:03:44,00:03:47,"Yeah, the Britney Spears opera, I think it was 1810."
00:03:47,00:03:49,One more time!
00:03:49,00:03:54,"But there was a thing where you would sing an on-cord,"
00:03:54,00:03:58,which wasn't even part of the opera you were seeing.
00:03:58,00:04:02,"So some singers in the 19th and even 20th century would sing an on-cord,"
00:04:02,00:04:06,"which is just a little musical bonus unrelated to the piece you'd just seen,"
00:04:06,00:04:07,or the opera you'd just seen.
00:04:07,00:04:10,And they would do on-cord after on-cord that was not in the opera.
00:04:10,00:04:14,"So there was a Polish tenor, whose name was Jan Kiepura,"
00:04:14,00:04:16,"and he made sure there was a piano in the wings,"
00:04:16,00:04:19,just in case he needed it for an on-cord.
00:04:19,00:04:22,"For an on-cord, but playing something else."
00:04:22,00:04:24,"Just for ""Pitching"" his other way."
00:04:24,00:04:29,It'd be like you suddenly reading a chapter of your novel mid show right now for us.
00:04:29,00:04:30,"I don't do that, Ali."
00:04:30,00:04:34,It was a dark and stormy night.
00:04:34,00:04:37,"Wow, okay."
00:04:37,00:04:40,The last time I heard you do that accent was Old John the Pooh smuggler.
00:04:40,00:04:43,He's a main character of the song.
00:04:44,00:04:47,"He's a Pooh smuggling ring, that's wide open."
00:04:47,00:04:49,"Oh, that's disgusting."
00:04:49,00:04:53,Anyway.
00:04:53,00:04:54,Any who onto opera?
00:04:54,00:04:55,"Yes, guys."
00:04:55,00:05:00,"Oh, Figaro was extremely popular, wasn't it?"
00:05:00,00:05:01,"Yeah, it was. It was a huge deal."
00:05:01,00:05:04,"Well, I think it was popular eventually."
00:05:04,00:05:07,"Apparently the first performance, they didn't love."
00:05:07,00:05:08,They didn't know what to make of it.
00:05:08,00:05:11,So this was in Vienna when it was first performed.
00:05:11,00:05:13,"And apparently it was ruined by Heklers,"
00:05:13,00:05:16,so someone who is there wrote that it was destroyed by
00:05:16,00:05:19,"obstreparous louts in the uppermost story,"
00:05:19,00:05:21,exerting their hired lungs with all their might
00:05:21,00:05:23,to deafen the singer's audience alike.
00:05:23,00:05:24,"Oh, wow."
00:05:24,00:05:26,"What sort of, is that from a rival composer?"
00:05:26,00:05:27,"I assume so, yeah."
00:05:27,00:05:28,What's it?
00:05:28,00:05:31,"And when it was played in Prague a bit later,"
00:05:31,00:05:32,it was really popular.
00:05:32,00:05:37,So Mozart said here they talk about nothing but Figaro.
00:05:37,00:05:40,"Nothing is played, sung or whistled, but Figaro."
00:05:40,00:05:43,No opera is drawing like Figaro.
00:05:43,00:05:44,"Nothing, but Figaro."
00:05:44,00:05:45,"All right, mate."
00:05:45,00:05:46,Oh.
00:05:46,00:05:47,Get over yourself.
00:05:47,00:05:52,"Yeah, I didn't even know it was a play before."
00:05:52,00:05:55,"Yeah. It was an opera, and it was written by a man"
00:05:55,00:05:58,"called Bommache, who is seriously interesting."
00:05:58,00:06:00,He's the best. He's incredible.
00:06:00,00:06:02,Because it was quite an incendiary play.
00:06:02,00:06:04,It had lots of stuff about the aristocracy being rubbish
00:06:04,00:06:06,and layabouts and useless.
00:06:06,00:06:09,"And it was all pretty, this was soon before the French Revolution."
00:06:09,00:06:13,"So Louis XVI banned performances of the play,"
00:06:13,00:06:14,which the opera was based on.
00:06:14,00:06:16,"Yeah, he said, actually, he said,"
00:06:16,00:06:18,"for this play not to be a danger,"
00:06:18,00:06:20,the Bastille would have to be torn down first.
00:06:20,00:06:21,Oh.
00:06:21,00:06:22,"And then everyone went, oh, that's an idea."
00:06:22,00:06:29,He actually referenced himself in a later play.
00:06:29,00:06:32,So I think it was in Don Giovanni in Act II.
00:06:32,00:06:34,"Mozart, which Mozart also wrote,"
00:06:34,00:06:36,"which also was an adaptation of the Bommache, Don Giovanni."
00:06:36,00:06:37,Really?
00:06:37,00:06:40,"He played some tuffle music, which is like table music,"
00:06:40,00:06:42,"and it's like background music,"
00:06:42,00:06:44,and I see my people are chatting away.
00:06:44,00:06:45,"And as part of the table music,"
00:06:45,00:06:48,he used a marriage of Figaro melody
00:06:48,00:06:50,that he got the wind plays to play.
00:06:50,00:06:53,So in his later opera was a cool back to his previous opera.
00:06:53,00:06:54,Wow.
00:06:54,00:06:57,"It was so far up his own ass, by that point."
00:06:57,00:07:01,"I love, there's another character who's a part of this story,"
00:07:01,00:07:06,"is Lorenzo Deponte, who was, he wrote the words to the opera."
00:07:06,00:07:10,So all the trilogy of those plays were done as a collaboration.
00:07:10,00:07:13,He was the Bernie Taupin to Mozart's Elton John.
00:07:13,00:07:15,"He was a big deal in his time, Lorenzo."
00:07:15,00:07:17,He was the court poet to Joseph II.
00:07:17,00:07:18,So that was great.
00:07:18,00:07:21,But then Joseph II died and Mozart died.
00:07:21,00:07:23,And he got banned from Austria.
00:07:23,00:07:25,And he had to flee where he moved to America
00:07:25,00:07:27,and opened a grocery store.
00:07:27,00:07:28,He lived in New York.
00:07:28,00:07:30,"He lived in Pennsylvania, New Jersey."
00:07:30,00:07:32,"In those times, he had a grocery store, a bookstore,"
00:07:32,00:07:35,"a traveling general store, a jinder stillery."
00:07:35,00:07:36,"So did he, he didn't bring the stores with him?"
00:07:36,00:07:38,"He did, he opened up a new store and every new place."
00:07:38,00:07:39,"Yeah, every new place, yeah."
00:07:39,00:07:42,"And then the general traveling store, I don't know about that,"
00:07:42,00:07:43,"because that was on wheels, I assume."
00:07:43,00:07:45,So he might have brought that everywhere.
00:07:45,00:07:46,"Traveling store, yeah."
00:07:46,00:07:48,"And he opened the first opera house in New York,"
00:07:48,00:07:49,but it closed after two seasons.
00:07:49,00:07:52,And it was the first opera house to play Italian opera.
00:07:52,00:07:54,"But unfortunately, yeah, it failed."
00:07:54,00:07:55,But amazing character.
00:07:55,00:07:56,"Yeah, and he was actually really important"
00:07:56,00:07:58,"with the marriage of Figaro, wasn't he?"
00:07:58,00:08:01,"Because Mozart wanted it to be close to the original story,"
00:08:01,00:08:05,"which, like Andy says, was really anti aristocracy."
00:08:05,00:08:07,"And it was about, was it about like someone"
00:08:07,00:08:09,who wants to share some guy's girlfriend?
00:08:09,00:08:10,And he's the Lord.
00:08:10,00:08:11,"And he's like, well, I'm the Lord."
00:08:11,00:08:12,So I'm allowed to share your girlfriend.
00:08:12,00:08:16,"And then the guy who's the girlfriend's boyfriend is like,"
00:08:16,00:08:19,"oh, you're only there because you're rich, you idiot."
00:08:19,00:08:20,And then all the people--
00:08:20,00:08:22,Are you talking about these tenders?
00:08:22,00:08:24,"Yeah, because then the other guy goes, you slag!"
00:08:24,00:08:27,You slag?
00:08:27,00:08:29,"He's not worth it, Figaro."
00:08:29,00:08:30,He's not worth it.
00:08:31,00:08:35,But there was loads of quotes about why the aristocracy
00:08:35,00:08:37,were bad in this original story.
00:08:37,00:08:41,"And it was Deponte who said, let's get rid of all those passages."
00:08:41,00:08:45,"Let's just stick with the comedy bit, with Barry and Janine."
00:08:45,00:08:48,Let's just stick with those ones and get rid of the Mitchell's.
00:08:48,00:08:49,"Yeah, wow."
00:08:49,00:08:51,"It's about-- I read the plot of it today,"
00:08:51,00:08:53,"because I've never heard the music except, obviously,"
00:08:53,00:08:56,I have when you press play on a Spotify list.
00:08:56,00:08:58,"It's like, oh, that most famous song ever, kind of thing."
00:08:58,00:09:00,Is that what your Spotify lists are?
00:09:00,00:09:02,They are now. It's that and Arianna Grande at the moment.
00:09:02,00:09:03,Don't ask me why.
00:09:03,00:09:06,It's Arias and Arianna.
00:09:06,00:09:06,"I know, pretty."
00:09:06,00:09:08,Lovely.
00:09:08,00:09:10,"So I'd never heard it before, and I read the plot today."
00:09:10,00:09:12,And it does read like a carry-on film.
00:09:12,00:09:14,"Like, it's total force."
00:09:14,00:09:16,There's stuff of having to hide in the bedrooms.
00:09:16,00:09:18,"Very funny, just even by plot."
00:09:18,00:09:19,I can't wait to see it.
00:09:19,00:09:21,It becomes less funny on stage.
00:09:21,00:09:22,"I doubt it, please."
00:09:22,00:09:27,"Apparently, I read that the play was so popular,"
00:09:27,00:09:29,"the original play that in France,"
00:09:29,00:09:31,women would have lines from the play
00:09:31,00:09:32,and scribed on their fans.
00:09:32,00:09:33,"Oh, cool."
00:09:33,00:09:35,"Yeah, so that became, like, sort of merchandise,"
00:09:35,00:09:39,"but bootleg and not official, not official merch."
00:09:39,00:09:41,"It's awful that when you said fans,"
00:09:41,00:09:41,"I thought you were going to say something, yeah."
00:09:41,00:09:43,"God, I thought you was going to say Fanny's as well."
00:09:43,00:09:45,"Yeah, I was going to say,"
00:09:45,00:09:49,how on earth you would scribe words for a play on your Fanny?
00:09:49,00:09:49,You need a mirror.
00:09:49,00:09:53,The only person you can read it is Leonardo da Vinci.
00:09:53,00:09:58,Do you guys know what the French for encore is?
00:09:59,00:09:59,Concorde.
00:09:59,00:10:01,Concorde.
00:10:01,00:10:02,So it's not on court.
00:10:02,00:10:03,It's not on court.
00:10:03,00:10:05,"Oh, it's not on court in the French accent."
00:10:05,00:10:07,It's not on court in any accent.
00:10:07,00:10:08,"No, it's B."
00:10:08,00:10:11,"So on court is the French for, can I have some more?"
00:10:11,00:10:13,"But actually the English language,"
00:10:13,00:10:15,nicked it from Italy's Angcora
00:10:15,00:10:16,"and changed it to on court,"
00:10:16,00:10:18,thinking that sounds nice in French.
00:10:18,00:10:20,But the French say B as in a second time.
00:10:20,00:10:21,Do it a second time.
00:10:21,00:10:22,"Like a second time, okay."
00:10:22,00:10:22,Yeah.
00:10:22,00:10:24,Not like a Buzzy family.
00:10:24,00:10:26,"No, like we've heard it once A."
00:10:26,00:10:27,Let's hear it B.
00:10:27,00:10:28,"Oh, that would be good."
00:10:28,00:10:31,It's interesting because so modern day on court
00:10:31,00:10:33,you don't repeat the material.
00:10:33,00:10:34,It's bits you haven't played.
00:10:34,00:10:36,So I don't know.
00:10:36,00:10:38,I once went to watch the band Junia Senior
00:10:38,00:10:40,and they only had one song.
00:10:40,00:10:41,"It was called ""Move Your Feet"""
00:10:41,00:10:42,that everyone had heard of
00:10:42,00:10:43,and they played it four times.
00:10:43,00:10:44,Did they?
00:10:44,00:10:45,Wow.
00:10:45,00:10:46,There are occasional times of that happens.
00:10:46,00:10:49,"In 1926, there was a musical called ""Betsy"""
00:10:49,00:10:51,which is a Roger's and Hart musical.
00:10:51,00:10:52,But there was a song that was added to it
00:10:52,00:10:54,the last minute which was Irving Berlin song
00:10:54,00:10:56,"and it was ""Blue Skies"""
00:10:56,00:10:59,and it was so popular that at the end of the night
00:10:59,00:11:00,they requested the song again
00:11:00,00:11:02,and the song by Bell Baker
00:11:02,00:11:05,but they requested it in total 24 times.
00:11:05,00:11:07,She did it on on court 24 times
00:11:07,00:11:09,and on the final time that she was singing it
00:11:09,00:11:12,she was so dazed from singing it she forgot the words.
00:11:12,00:11:14,"And while she forgot the words,"
00:11:14,00:11:16,suddenly a voice could be heard from the front row
00:11:16,00:11:17,which was Irving Berlin
00:11:17,00:11:19,who was filling in for the missing lyrics
00:11:19,00:11:21,and singing the rest of the song for.
00:11:21,00:11:21,No way.
00:11:21,00:11:22,Quite a cool opening night.
00:11:22,00:11:24,It must have been some people in the crowd
00:11:24,00:11:26,who were saying after maybe the 20th time.
00:11:26,00:11:29,"Well, we've all had a really good time."
00:11:29,00:11:31,"Yeah, it's cool."
00:11:31,00:11:33,That is hell.
00:11:33,00:11:34,You've got to turn it down.
00:11:34,00:11:36,"You've got to learn to say no to an encore, I think,"
00:11:36,00:11:37,in that instance.
00:11:37,00:11:38,There's just no way of voting.
00:11:38,00:11:41,"There's no, if a few people really want an encore"
00:11:41,00:11:42,then you might get one.
00:11:42,00:11:43,It's hard.
00:11:43,00:11:44,"Well, there used to be a thing, in fact,"
00:11:44,00:11:46,where in the 19th century
00:11:46,00:11:48,at these choral festivals that happened
00:11:48,00:11:50,"it was so irritating that, you know,"
00:11:50,00:11:51,you kept getting loads of oncours
00:11:51,00:11:53,that the encore decision was reserved
00:11:53,00:11:55,"for a single person,"
00:11:55,00:11:57,"like the bishop, or the male, or whoever."
00:11:57,00:12:02,And they could decide what they wanted to hear again.
00:12:02,00:12:05,Just because you talked about the bishop.
00:12:05,00:12:05,Yeah.
00:12:05,00:12:09,"Do you know that just after the marriage of Figaro started,"
00:12:09,00:12:12,Beaumache got arrested and got sent to prison?
00:12:12,00:12:17,And that was because there was a protest outside of the play
00:12:17,00:12:20,which involved the Archbishop of Paris.
00:12:20,00:12:23,And he apparently assaulted the Archbishop of Paris
00:12:23,00:12:26,and got sent to prison for bashing the bishop.
00:12:26,00:12:26,Shut up.
00:12:26,00:12:30,That's where we get the phrase from.
00:12:30,00:12:34,And was he assaulting him?
00:12:34,00:12:37,"But had he said, had he banned an encore or something?"
00:12:37,00:12:39,"Well, the Archbishop was trying to stop people"
00:12:39,00:12:40,from going into the theatre
00:12:40,00:12:43,"because he was like, stop this filth kind of thing."
00:12:43,00:12:45,"So he was like, stopping anyone from going in"
00:12:45,00:12:47,"and he was like, how can you stop these ladies"
00:12:47,00:12:48,from coming in? You shouldn't.
00:12:48,00:12:50,And he kind of bashed him out of the way.
00:12:50,00:12:51,And then he got arrested.
00:12:51,00:12:53,It's freezing for a bruising.
00:12:53,00:12:55,Dashing for a bashing.
00:12:55,00:12:57,He was dashing for a bashing.
00:12:57,00:12:58,"Anyway, Andy's novel is available."
00:12:58,00:13:00,"Oh, goodbye, Scott."
00:13:00,00:13:02,It's a dark star in the night.
00:13:02,00:13:05,It's a combination of Dr. Seuss and the Pirates of Pensans.
00:13:05,00:13:13,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:13:13,00:13:15,And that is James.
00:13:15,00:13:17,"OK, my fact this week is that humans"
00:13:17,00:13:20,have transported European earthworms
00:13:20,00:13:24,to every continent on the planet except Antarctica.
00:13:24,00:13:28,"In a process, some worm experts are calling global warming."
00:13:28,00:13:30,It's really good.
00:13:30,00:13:34,"Delivered that like as a Fox News headly, really?"
00:13:34,00:13:38,"Well, this was an amazing article"
00:13:38,00:13:41,that I read in the Atlantic by Julia Rosen.
00:13:41,00:13:43,And it's all about earthworms.
00:13:43,00:13:47,"And the fact that mainly if you go to North America,"
00:13:47,00:13:49,they had a big glacial ice sheet over there
00:13:49,00:13:51,"about 10,000 years ago."
00:13:51,00:13:53,And it killed off all of the worms.
00:13:53,00:13:54,"And so you would think there'd be no worms there,"
00:13:54,00:13:56,but actually there are worms there.
00:13:56,00:13:58,And that's because humans have brought them over.
00:13:58,00:14:00,And this is actually bad news for the environment
00:14:00,00:14:04,because worms are pretty good for the environment in some ways.
00:14:04,00:14:06,"But if you put them in a place where they're not supposed to be,"
00:14:06,00:14:09,"then like all animals, that's not a good thing."
00:14:09,00:14:11,I like the tone in which it's--
00:14:11,00:14:11,Here's Tom with the weather.
00:14:11,00:14:16,"No, but it is surprising."
00:14:16,00:14:18,Because I would have thought that I thought
00:14:18,00:14:19,before researching this fact that worms were good
00:14:19,00:14:21,pretty much wherever you had them.
00:14:21,00:14:23,Because they--
00:14:23,00:14:24,What are they doing in the UK?
00:14:24,00:14:26,They make your soil better.
00:14:26,00:14:27,Yeah.
00:14:27,00:14:28,And they make channels in it.
00:14:28,00:14:30,"Some people say it's a bit of a myth, actually."
00:14:30,00:14:33,And a worm is a symptom rather than a cause of good soil.
00:14:33,00:14:35,So they go to good soil?
00:14:35,00:14:36,Is the idea?
00:14:36,00:14:37,That's an idea.
00:14:37,00:14:39,"Right, that's interesting."
00:14:39,00:14:41,It's a controversial issue.
00:14:41,00:14:42,I don't want to get into it right now.
00:14:42,00:14:44,But that's what some people say.
00:14:44,00:14:45,"But basically where they shouldn't be,"
00:14:45,00:14:50,they are-- the soil in the boreal forest
00:14:50,00:14:52,in the northern half of the planet.
00:14:52,00:14:55,It's the largest carbon sink at the bottom.
00:14:55,00:14:58,It has 200 billion metric tons of carbon
00:14:58,00:14:59,in this boreal forest.
00:14:59,00:15:00,And that's not just in the trees.
00:15:00,00:15:01,I didn't realize that either.
00:15:01,00:15:02,Loads of it is actually in the soil.
00:15:02,00:15:05,"But under a tree, you might get twice as much"
00:15:05,00:15:07,carbon in the soil as there is in the tree itself.
00:15:07,00:15:09,Which I had no idea about.
00:15:09,00:15:11,"And so the worms, sometimes, they eat the top layer"
00:15:11,00:15:12,"of the soil, basically."
00:15:12,00:15:14,And they just make it thinner and thinner and thinner.
00:15:14,00:15:17,And then all the carbon is actually being released at the air
00:15:17,00:15:19,because the worms are eating it up and creating channels.
00:15:19,00:15:20,Although there is another argument
00:15:20,00:15:22,"that when they're making their casts,"
00:15:22,00:15:23,"which is when you're eating soil,"
00:15:23,00:15:26,you kind of give out some soil poo stuff
00:15:26,00:15:30,that that actually keeps in loads more carbon.
00:15:30,00:15:31,"So really, actually, these days,"
00:15:31,00:15:33,no one has really looked into earthworms enough
00:15:33,00:15:36,to know exactly what they're doing to the environment.
00:15:36,00:15:38,I didn't realize they were such a hot bed of debate.
00:15:38,00:15:39,Yeah.
00:15:39,00:15:41,We don't see enough of this on earth to be.
00:15:41,00:15:42,Yeah.
00:15:42,00:15:43,Just wait till next week.
00:15:43,00:15:45,Piersmog and they'll be whining all about earthworms.
00:15:45,00:15:48,But they eat seeds.
00:15:48,00:15:51,"They eat seeds, which you'd think would be fine"
00:15:51,00:15:52,because it's just their diet.
00:15:52,00:15:54,"But in the bits of America,"
00:15:54,00:15:57,"north of the Mason-Dixon line and east of the Great Plains,"
00:15:57,00:15:58,"where they used to not exist,"
00:15:58,00:16:00,there used to be millipedes and mites everywhere.
00:16:00,00:16:01,And that's just worms.
00:16:01,00:16:01,Yeah.
00:16:01,00:16:03,So they're hugely invasive.
00:16:03,00:16:06,"And so for sure, it's quite bad for them to be up there."
00:16:06,00:16:07,"Because like, for instance,"
00:16:07,00:16:10,you've got all this bits of leaves and stuff on the floor
00:16:10,00:16:11,"and all the millipedes live under there,"
00:16:11,00:16:13,nice and happy.
00:16:13,00:16:14,And then suddenly the worms come along
00:16:14,00:16:17,and they just eat all of the leaves and stuff like that.
00:16:17,00:16:19,And there's nowhere for the millipedes to live and they all die.
00:16:19,00:16:22,"And someone said in this ass-close reading,"
00:16:22,00:16:24,I think it was in this Atlantic article
00:16:24,00:16:26,"that it's like going to the African-Sovanna,"
00:16:26,00:16:29,taking out all the animals and just replacing them all
00:16:29,00:16:30,with elephants.
00:16:30,00:16:32,And just tons of elephants everywhere.
00:16:32,00:16:33,Yeah.
00:16:33,00:16:36,And one of the problems seems to be that we know very little about them
00:16:36,00:16:37,to some extent.
00:16:37,00:16:41,"So it was only in 2008 that we discovered the common earthworm,"
00:16:41,00:16:43,"which was thought to be one species, it was actually five."
00:16:43,00:16:45,Wow.
00:16:45,00:16:48,So that one common earthworm is different from another
00:16:48,00:16:50,as a human from an ape.
00:16:50,00:16:53,"And in the US, I like this quote."
00:16:53,00:16:56,"In the US, I was reading a one article, a quote,"
00:16:56,00:16:58,"which said, ""Shocking me little is known about"
00:16:58,00:16:59,any of our native earthworms.
00:16:59,00:17:03,There is only one working earthworm taxonomist
00:17:03,00:17:05,"in all of America."""
00:17:05,00:17:07,So I looked into this because I wanted to find out who it was.
00:17:07,00:17:09,"That's an easy job, isn't it?"
00:17:09,00:17:12,"Of all taxonomy, oh, taxonomy, I thought it was taxidermy."
00:17:12,00:17:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:14,00:17:16,Worm taxidermy is very easy.
00:17:16,00:17:17,Yeah.
00:17:17,00:17:18,You're right.
00:17:18,00:17:22,"You just cut off the end and go, just blow out the middle."
00:17:22,00:17:23,"Yeah, yeah."
00:17:23,00:17:26,So I tried to find out about who the taxonomist is.
00:17:26,00:17:28,"And anyway, it came, of course, this 1995 book."
00:17:28,00:17:30,And I was just so impressed at the level of research.
00:17:30,00:17:32,So it was about worms.
00:17:32,00:17:36,"And it says, there's one trained professional worm"
00:17:36,00:17:37,taxonomist in America.
00:17:37,00:17:39,"And then it says, there is sort of a second,"
00:17:39,00:17:42,"but she's only recently trained, so not good enough."
00:17:42,00:17:45,"And then says, OK, there's a third expert."
00:17:45,00:17:46,He was trained by his mother.
00:17:46,00:17:48,And he actually works in a post office.
00:17:48,00:17:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:50,00:17:53,"And then it was like, he said, ""The fourth and last person"
00:17:53,00:17:56,in North America who has any knowledge of earthworm taxonomy
00:17:56,00:17:59,"works as a police lawyer in New Brunswick, Canada."""
00:17:59,00:18:00,Wow.
00:18:00,00:18:02,This guy has actually been around every single person
00:18:02,00:18:05,in America to find out if they know about earthworms.
00:18:05,00:18:06,That's really impressive.
00:18:06,00:18:07,So impressive.
00:18:07,00:18:08,Yeah.
00:18:08,00:18:10,You can get three meter long worms.
00:18:10,00:18:11,That's long.
00:18:11,00:18:14,"Yeah, this is the Australian giant Jipsland earthworm."
00:18:14,00:18:15,Up to three meters long.
00:18:15,00:18:20,"And apparently, they used to be very abundant in the 1800s."
00:18:20,00:18:21,"And if you plowed your fields, they'd"
00:18:21,00:18:25,be red with blood from all these worms that you'd plowed up.
00:18:25,00:18:26,That's long.
00:18:26,00:18:27,"It's pretty messed up, yeah."
00:18:27,00:18:29,"They would hang from the plow's like spaghetti,"
00:18:29,00:18:31,someone described it as.
00:18:31,00:18:31,Wow.
00:18:31,00:18:33,And but they're quite cool.
00:18:33,00:18:33,So you can hear them.
00:18:33,00:18:36,They're so big and they're so vocal that when you're
00:18:36,00:18:39,"walking in the territory in the Jipsland area,"
00:18:39,00:18:40,in the territory where they live.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, you're walking on the--"
00:18:42,00:18:45,Ow.
00:18:45,00:18:47,"Is that what you say vocal, is that what you mean?"
00:18:47,00:18:48,That's sort of what I mean.
00:18:48,00:18:50,"But if you walk on the ground, you can hear them squelching"
00:18:50,00:18:53,and squirming underfoot because they're very fast.
00:18:53,00:18:54,And so they squirm away.
00:18:54,00:18:57,"And so if you walk, you'll hear a gurgling squelching sound."
00:18:57,00:18:58,"It's like they're moving through their burrows, I think,"
00:18:58,00:19:01,because it's like the water draining in a bath.
00:19:01,00:19:03,They move through the--
00:19:03,00:19:05,"yeah, their bodies are slimy against the walls of their burrow."
00:19:05,00:19:06,"Oh, wow."
00:19:06,00:19:08,They're a foot long when they're born.
00:19:08,00:19:09,When they're born?
00:19:09,00:19:10,"Yeah, they're really big."
00:19:10,00:19:11,Are they born in eggs?
00:19:11,00:19:12,So they're in like a cocoon type thing.
00:19:12,00:19:15,I don't know if they're eggs or born live.
00:19:15,00:19:17,But they do-- so they have no teeth.
00:19:17,00:19:20,But they do have a gizzard.
00:19:20,00:19:21,"Well, you know they're like a chicken."
00:19:21,00:19:22,"Like a chicken, yeah."
00:19:22,00:19:24,At least swallow little rocks.
00:19:24,00:19:26,And they use those to grind up their food inside them.
00:19:26,00:19:28,Do you know how you collect worms?
00:19:28,00:19:31,Because there's a worm conservation effort going on now
00:19:31,00:19:33,in the worms are good for the environment lobby.
00:19:33,00:19:37,So I think you tap the ground and they think there's a bird there.
00:19:37,00:19:39,"No, they think there's rain there."
00:19:39,00:19:40,And they come up thinking there's rain.
00:19:40,00:19:42,And then you just plop them out.
00:19:42,00:19:43,You do do a bit of that.
00:19:43,00:19:45,And we have mentioned the worm tapping before.
00:19:45,00:19:47,"I was actually talking about the more brutal way,"
00:19:47,00:19:49,"which is you just shove a spade in the ass, which"
00:19:49,00:19:51,is what people used to do.
00:19:51,00:19:53,And they're doing much less now.
00:19:53,00:19:55,But it turns out you're just cutting them in half all the time.
00:19:55,00:19:57,And that does cause a bit of an issue.
00:19:57,00:19:58,"Because if you're trying to get rid of them,"
00:19:58,00:20:00,you're just doubling the population.
00:20:00,00:20:02,Exactly.
00:20:02,00:20:04,It gets out of control.
00:20:04,00:20:06,"No, so what they do to avoid using the shovel now"
00:20:06,00:20:08,is they take DNA swabs.
00:20:08,00:20:10,Because it's all about counting the population
00:20:10,00:20:11,of a certain species.
00:20:11,00:20:14,And so you swab the mucus from their passages.
00:20:14,00:20:16,So they make these tiny channels.
00:20:16,00:20:17,And scientists who are looking into earth
00:20:17,00:20:21,and populations will just swab a worm tunnel.
00:20:21,00:20:22,And they scrape their saliva off it.
00:20:22,00:20:24,And then they measure it in a test tube.
00:20:24,00:20:26,"When you said swapping their passages,"
00:20:26,00:20:29,I thought it was like inside the body passages.
00:20:29,00:20:31,"It's not a small swab, isn't it?"
00:20:31,00:20:36,"So I was thinking, worm goes, I've got my GP check up again."
00:20:36,00:20:38,"Worms, be a test."
00:20:38,00:20:42,There's only one stair up.
00:20:42,00:20:44,And the doctor uses a cocktail stick.
00:20:44,00:20:45,Yeah.
00:20:45,00:20:49,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:20:49,00:20:51,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:20:51,00:20:52,And that is my fact.
00:20:52,00:20:55,My fact this week is that the most popular street in America
00:20:55,00:20:57,is second street.
00:20:57,00:20:59,The second most popular street is third street.
00:20:59,00:21:03,And the third most popular street is first street.
00:21:03,00:21:04,So--
00:21:04,00:21:07,And who's on first?
00:21:07,00:21:09,"Yeah, so fourth is fourth, fifth is park,"
00:21:09,00:21:14,"and sixth is fifth, just to bring you further down the list."
00:21:14,00:21:17,Is there not Main Street here in any way?
00:21:17,00:21:18,So there is.
00:21:18,00:21:20,This is from 1993.
00:21:20,00:21:23,This was the Census Bureau in America released this report.
00:21:23,00:21:28,"In recent years, I think it was in the 2013 sort of period."
00:21:28,00:21:33,They released all new information about the general information
00:21:33,00:21:35,"about geography, topography, and so on."
00:21:35,00:21:37,But they didn't do the same list that they've done before.
00:21:37,00:21:38,And few people have gone through it completely
00:21:38,00:21:39,and they've compiled lists.
00:21:39,00:21:42,But none of them seemed to tally with the others.
00:21:42,00:21:45,So Washington posted one where they said that park
00:21:45,00:21:47,was the number one street.
00:21:47,00:21:49,But then someone on Reddit called Darren Hawley.
00:21:49,00:21:53,He did one that said Main Street was the top one.
00:21:53,00:21:55,And so they think the reason first is not up there
00:21:55,00:21:59,"is because first and main were two versions of saying first,"
00:21:59,00:22:00,basically.
00:22:00,00:22:00,So it knocked it down.
00:22:00,00:22:01,It halved its chances.
00:22:01,00:22:04,"Also, the idea is that if you have a first street,"
00:22:04,00:22:06,"which is your main street in your town,"
00:22:06,00:22:08,"you might name it after George Washington,"
00:22:08,00:22:11,"or Abraham Lincoln, or Donald Trump, or something like that."
00:22:11,00:22:12,Yeah.
00:22:12,00:22:13,Did you know that Ludford in Lincolnshire
00:22:13,00:22:15,has a street named after Donald Trump?
00:22:15,00:22:16,"Well, I say it's named after Donald Trump."
00:22:16,00:22:18,It's called Fanny Hands Lane.
00:22:18,00:22:19,"Oh, my God."
00:22:19,00:22:20,Sorry.
00:22:20,00:22:22,"Cheap, cheap, and unfair."
00:22:22,00:22:24,"But actually, there's nothing rude about it."
00:22:24,00:22:25,Nothing rude about Fanny Hands Lane.
00:22:25,00:22:26,"Yes, there is."
00:22:26,00:22:28,The word Fanny.
00:22:28,00:22:30,It has been claimed that it's affecting property prices
00:22:30,00:22:32,that are having a street called Fanny Hands Lane.
00:22:32,00:22:34,"But the thing is, it was just named in the 19th century"
00:22:34,00:22:38,by a man named John Hans after his wife Fanny.
00:22:38,00:22:39,"No, there's nothing rude about it."
00:22:39,00:22:45,"Do you know in London, just down the road from here,"
00:22:45,00:22:48,there's a place called Knight Rider Street.
00:22:48,00:22:49,"Oh, no."
00:22:49,00:22:50,Very cool.
00:22:50,00:22:52,And do you know who it's named after?
00:22:52,00:22:53,"Hasselhoff, I would say."
00:22:53,00:22:54,"Well, the car."
00:22:54,00:22:56,"No, obviously not."
00:22:56,00:22:59,"No, it was because it was the route that Knight used to take"
00:22:59,00:23:02,from the Tower of London to Smithfield where
00:23:02,00:23:03,Jowse were held.
00:23:03,00:23:05,So Knight's would ride across that street.
00:23:05,00:23:07,"And they're talking carriages, wouldn't they?"
00:23:07,00:23:08,Yes.
00:23:08,00:23:15,I was reading about Nicaragua's capital city of Managua.
00:23:15,00:23:17,So I was trying to find out based on this fact
00:23:17,00:23:18,about street names.
00:23:18,00:23:19,I was trying to find out if there was anywhere
00:23:19,00:23:22,"where the streets have no name, like in the salt."
00:23:22,00:23:23,Yeah.
00:23:23,00:23:25,Because Bono wrote that while on a visit to Ethiopia
00:23:25,00:23:27,and it's thought that it was about the poverty there
00:23:27,00:23:31,and that it didn't have proper street naming system.
00:23:31,00:23:34,"So in Managua, in Nicaragua, it did have a modern grid system"
00:23:34,00:23:35,until 1972.
00:23:35,00:23:38,And then there was an earthquake which destroyed lots
00:23:38,00:23:40,of buildings and infrastructure.
00:23:40,00:23:42,"And basically, they've replaced the system"
00:23:42,00:23:43,with a really ramshackle one.
00:23:43,00:23:45,So you might be directed to somewhere
00:23:45,00:23:47,which is a block south of the Convent and half a block east
00:23:47,00:23:49,of the College.
00:23:49,00:23:50,And you just have to get there.
00:23:50,00:23:52,And so taxi drivers there are amazingly good
00:23:52,00:23:54,because they know all these places.
00:23:54,00:23:55,And sometimes you'll ask for directions
00:23:55,00:23:57,"and you'll be told, oh yeah, go to the Blue House"
00:23:57,00:23:59,which is actually brown.
00:23:59,00:24:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:01,00:24:03,That's because locals know that there is a house
00:24:03,00:24:05,"which is brown, but it used to be blue."
00:24:05,00:24:06,Wow.
00:24:06,00:24:06,That's so good.
00:24:06,00:24:07,I know.
00:24:07,00:24:08,So Kaby's there at like next level.
00:24:08,00:24:11,Or you might be told to go down and that means go west
00:24:11,00:24:13,because the sun goes down in the west.
00:24:13,00:24:14,"Oh, that's good."
00:24:14,00:24:17,It's-- I don't know how any stuff gets delivered properly.
00:24:17,00:24:18,Also very difficult if you've got one
00:24:18,00:24:20,of those travelling shops who were talking about it.
00:24:20,00:24:23,Yeah.
00:24:23,00:24:25,But it does talk about this kind of thing.
00:24:25,00:24:27,It makes you really respect America
00:24:27,00:24:28,for having just gone down the line.
00:24:28,00:24:31,"Grid system, you know, this is the number of the street."
00:24:31,00:24:32,This is the number of the avenue.
00:24:32,00:24:33,It's very boring.
00:24:33,00:24:35,It's very effective.
00:24:35,00:24:39,"And so that was come up with by Penn, after him, Pennsylvania"
00:24:39,00:24:40,named.
00:24:40,00:24:43,Not from Penn and Teller.
00:24:43,00:24:46,Just magic streets into existence.
00:24:46,00:24:49,"So William Penn, he came up with the grid system in 1682"
00:24:49,00:24:52,"when he founded Philadelphia, which was only founded"
00:24:52,00:24:55,"because basically the King of England, King Charles II,"
00:24:55,00:24:58,was massively in debt to him and had no money to pay him.
00:24:58,00:25:02,"So instead said, have this random tract of land"
00:25:02,00:25:03,in Philadelphia.
00:25:03,00:25:04,And so he gave him this land.
00:25:04,00:25:08,"And so Penn, famous Quaker, said of this utopian,"
00:25:08,00:25:10,where he wanted to be a utopian society.
00:25:10,00:25:12,But he really didn't want it to be called Pennsylvania.
00:25:12,00:25:15,And also Pennsylvania is not named after him.
00:25:15,00:25:17,It's named after his dad.
00:25:17,00:25:18,"Yeah, who happens to have the same name?"
00:25:18,00:25:21,He was very clear.
00:25:21,00:25:24,I don't want to think I'm a cocky twat.
00:25:24,00:25:26,"He wanted to call it New Wales, because it reminded him"
00:25:26,00:25:29,"so much of Wales, which was very fond."
00:25:29,00:25:31,"Anyway, so he really didn't want it to be called named after him."
00:25:31,00:25:36,"And now Pennsylvania forever bears his name, which is very sad."
00:25:36,00:25:37,That's cool.
00:25:37,00:25:39,And they're quite good at coming up
00:25:39,00:25:40,"with funny names in America, aren't they?"
00:25:40,00:25:42,Of the streets.
00:25:42,00:25:43,"I know they do have lots of firsts and seconds,"
00:25:43,00:25:45,but there's a few funny ones.
00:25:45,00:25:47,Shall we mention them before?
00:25:47,00:25:50,I did say once that the number 69 road marker's always
00:25:50,00:25:51,"gets stolen, don't we?"
00:25:51,00:25:51,Yes.
00:25:51,00:25:52,Didn't we?
00:25:52,00:25:56,And there's a stoner drive in Colesville and a blunt road.
00:25:56,00:26:00,And they have had people stealing their road signs all the time.
00:26:00,00:26:03,But they've come up with a way of stopping that.
00:26:03,00:26:06,And that is they're making them without any vowels.
00:26:06,00:26:09,"So what used to say stoner drive now says,"
00:26:09,00:26:13,"ST, blank N, blank R, drive."
00:26:13,00:26:17,And what used to be blunt road is now BLNT road.
00:26:17,00:26:18,Do they leave the space?
00:26:18,00:26:19,They leave the space.
00:26:19,00:26:20,This is the space.
00:26:20,00:26:20,"Oh, wow."
00:26:20,00:26:23,Because that just looks like it was made by a stoner.
00:26:23,00:26:24,Yes.
00:26:24,00:26:26,It just couldn't be bothered finishing it.
00:26:26,00:26:29,"Unfortunately, they've all been stolen by fans of only connects."
00:26:29,00:26:32,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:26:32,00:26:35,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:26:35,00:26:37,And that is Andy.
00:26:37,00:26:38,My fact is that the game of Scrabble
00:26:38,00:26:42,is partly thanks to Edgar Allan Poe.
00:26:42,00:26:45,"Oh, spooky."
00:26:45,00:26:51,"And that's why spooky with 20 O's is actually accepted in Scrabble, isn't it?"
00:26:51,00:26:53,So this is about the man who invented Scrabble.
00:26:53,00:26:55,His name was Alfred Mosher buts.
00:26:55,00:26:56,And he--
00:26:56,00:26:58,"He sounds like a good time, doesn't he?"
00:26:58,00:26:59,Yeah.
00:26:59,00:27:00,He's a good time guy.
00:27:00,00:27:03,"Yeah, that's Mosher buts."
00:27:03,00:27:06,He was an unemployed architect.
00:27:06,00:27:09,"He was a sack architect in Depression era America,"
00:27:09,00:27:10,so early '30s.
00:27:10,00:27:13,And he was trying to work out how to come up with a ball game
00:27:13,00:27:15,because he thought this could be worthwhile.
00:27:15,00:27:18,"He thought there aren't many wordy board games at the time,"
00:27:18,00:27:19,which there weren't.
00:27:19,00:27:20,I think he was playing.
00:27:20,00:27:22,Was he playing trivial pursuit or something?
00:27:22,00:27:24,He was playing some game that he absolutely hated
00:27:24,00:27:26,and there must be something better than this.
00:27:26,00:27:27,"Yeah, exactly."
00:27:27,00:27:30,"And he was inspired by Manopoli as well, I think."
00:27:30,00:27:32,And so he-- but he was trying to work out how to come up
00:27:32,00:27:34,with a word game because he thought this might be something.
00:27:34,00:27:38,"And he had read, as a child, the Edgar Allan Poe story,"
00:27:38,00:27:41,"the Gold Bug, and there's a code in that, which"
00:27:41,00:27:42,has to be broken.
00:27:42,00:27:44,And the way to break the code is that it's
00:27:44,00:27:46,based on how frequently particular letters
00:27:46,00:27:48,appear in the English language.
00:27:48,00:27:52,So the one that appears most is E and so on.
00:27:52,00:27:53,And so--
00:27:53,00:27:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:55,00:27:57,"And you know the rest, yeah."
00:27:57,00:28:02,And so he decided to make that the system by which letters
00:28:02,00:28:04,would score more or less in scramble.
00:28:04,00:28:06,And he studied newspaper front pages for ages.
00:28:06,00:28:09,And you can see there are photos online of his tally charts
00:28:09,00:28:11,"where he's methodically counting each letter,"
00:28:11,00:28:15,"how often it appears on the front page of the New York Times,"
00:28:15,00:28:16,"say, very dedicated."
00:28:16,00:28:19,"Yeah, and that's what came up with the scoring system."
00:28:19,00:28:20,That's cool.
00:28:20,00:28:22,He didn't really like playing his game too much by the end
00:28:22,00:28:27,"because his wife always beat him, Mrs. Butts."
00:28:27,00:28:33,"She once scoured 234 for Quixotic against him, yeah."
00:28:33,00:28:34,Apparently.
00:28:34,00:28:35,"This-- he sounds like a sore loser,"
00:28:35,00:28:37,because I'd assumed it was only because he was losing it
00:28:37,00:28:40,trivial pursuit that he invented scrabble and twisted it.
00:28:40,00:28:41,I've got to invent some game.
00:28:41,00:28:42,"OK, here's a game."
00:28:42,00:28:45,Whoever has a stupid name wins.
00:28:45,00:28:49,They've still a log comes funny hands off the fuck's sake.
00:28:49,00:28:52,They've still got the scorecard.
00:28:52,00:28:55,The nephew-- there was a journalist who fell madly in love
00:28:55,00:28:56,with the history of Scrabble.
00:28:56,00:28:59,And he'd track down the nephew who has no interest in playing it
00:28:59,00:29:01,but has an obsession with collecting all the things
00:29:01,00:29:02,that let's--
00:29:02,00:29:04,"Well, so I track down Mocha Butts as an nephew, right?"
00:29:04,00:29:06,And in his house-- so he has everything framed.
00:29:06,00:29:08,But most of it is not up on the walls.
00:29:08,00:29:09,It's still in the sort of brown packaging
00:29:09,00:29:11,that the frame has handed it over in.
00:29:11,00:29:14,And one of those is the scorecard.
00:29:14,00:29:20,So Mrs. Butts kept the scorecard from her Quixotic score.
00:29:20,00:29:20,I think you were.
00:29:20,00:29:24,"There were more problems in the marriage, weren't there?"
00:29:24,00:29:26,If you're framing your victories over your husband--
00:29:26,00:29:27,"Well, no, actually, James is right."
00:29:27,00:29:29,"If you'd scored Quixotic-- and supposedly,"
00:29:29,00:29:31,it was across two triple word scores.
00:29:31,00:29:33,"I mean, it sounds like an absolute--"
00:29:33,00:29:34,"Sorry, checks out."
00:29:34,00:29:35,Yeah.
00:29:35,00:29:38,Set up.
00:29:38,00:29:41,"Do you know who is the best Scrabble players in the world,"
00:29:41,00:29:44,which country?
00:29:44,00:29:44,America.
00:29:44,00:29:45,"Yes, I know."
00:29:45,00:29:46,France?
00:29:46,00:29:47,No.
00:29:47,00:29:49,"Well, I'm going to say from an old episode,"
00:29:49,00:29:51,I think it's a guy from New Zealand.
00:29:51,00:29:54,"Ah, yes, because he managed to win the French one,"
00:29:54,00:29:56,"didn't he, despite not being able to speak French?"
00:29:56,00:29:56,Yes.
00:29:56,00:29:58,"But no, it is Nigeria."
00:29:58,00:30:01,"OK, and the Nigerian Scrabble Federation,"
00:30:01,00:30:03,because this year said that they really
00:30:03,00:30:06,"need to be given more money from the government,"
00:30:06,00:30:08,"because according to them, it's the only spot"
00:30:08,00:30:11,that they're the world's best at in the world
00:30:11,00:30:12,in this Scrabble.
00:30:12,00:30:13,Oh.
00:30:13,00:30:16,Can I just quickly-- because we spoke about Nigel Richards
00:30:16,00:30:17,in episode 79.
00:30:17,00:30:20,"Long time ago, this is the guy who won the French Scrabble thing."
00:30:20,00:30:22,"I just wanted to check on an update on him,"
00:30:22,00:30:24,see how he's doing in his championships.
00:30:24,00:30:27,He is still the winner of the French Scrabble Championships.
00:30:27,00:30:31,"He won 2017, 2018, and 2019."
00:30:31,00:30:32,In their elite competitions.
00:30:32,00:30:33,So he's still just owning it.
00:30:33,00:30:36,"Yeah, how-- really how many people are competing?"
00:30:36,00:30:37,"It's a biggie, I think."
00:30:37,00:30:38,"Is it, though?"
00:30:38,00:30:40,"It's Scrabble, isn't it?"
00:30:40,00:30:41,Let's face it.
00:30:41,00:30:43,Do you know who our Scrabble champion is?
00:30:43,00:30:44,"No, look."
00:30:44,00:30:44,He's a great guy.
00:30:44,00:30:46,He's called Alan Simmons.
00:30:46,00:30:49,"And he is banned from playing Scrabble as of 2017,"
00:30:49,00:30:51,because he cheated by peaking at the letters
00:30:51,00:30:53,who are picking out the bag and then putting that back in
00:30:53,00:30:55,and swapping them for other letters.
00:30:55,00:30:58,That is Scrabble Champion of the UK.
00:30:58,00:31:00,Wow.
00:31:00,00:31:01,But that's a thing.
00:31:01,00:31:03,There's a rule where I think maybe--
00:31:03,00:31:05,"who knows if it's thanks to Simmons or not,"
00:31:05,00:31:07,but there's a rule where you have to take the letters out
00:31:07,00:31:09,of the bag at eye height or higher.
00:31:09,00:31:10,Really?
00:31:10,00:31:12,He was done for holding the bag too low.
00:31:12,00:31:13,That's great.
00:31:13,00:31:15,And there's a thing called Brailing.
00:31:15,00:31:16,Have you heard this?
00:31:16,00:31:16,"Oh, yeah."
00:31:16,00:31:21,Brailing is feeling letters as you're holding them in the bag
00:31:21,00:31:23,and trying to work out what they are.
00:31:23,00:31:23,Yeah.
00:31:23,00:31:24,"That makes sense, right?"
00:31:24,00:31:26,Because a blank would just be a flat surface.
00:31:26,00:31:27,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:31:27,00:31:28,"Yeah, that's true."
00:31:28,00:31:31,"But I mean, I'm not very-- I can imagine taking a long time"
00:31:31,00:31:33,"to work out, oh, it's an E or whatever."
00:31:33,00:31:35,"Like, it's quite impressive that you get a--"
00:31:35,00:31:36,"Yeah, it's not just blanks and non-blanks."
00:31:36,00:31:38,"OK, they're more sophisticated than that."
00:31:38,00:31:40,"I mean, you could say that, huh?"
00:31:40,00:31:41,"It's no blank, yeah."
00:31:41,00:31:44,I think if you're taking out three or four Scrabble tiles
00:31:44,00:31:47,"each time and you pick four, quickly feel them."
00:31:47,00:31:48,"And if there's no blank, you pick another four."
00:31:48,00:31:50,That's going to over-long run.
00:31:50,00:31:51,That's going to make a difference.
00:31:51,00:31:51,Yeah.
00:31:51,00:31:53,"Yeah, your mind averages, yeah."
00:31:53,00:31:56,But I do think that if you are fumbling around
00:31:56,00:31:58,"for what shapes the indentations and Scrabble tiles,"
00:31:58,00:32:00,you just need to reflect on your life.
00:32:00,00:32:01,"Just with your hand in the bag, you need to think,"
00:32:01,00:32:02,what the fuck am I doing?
00:32:02,00:32:03,Winning.
00:32:03,00:32:04,Winning.
00:32:04,00:32:07,Winning.
00:32:07,00:32:09,One thing that was a new exciting moment in Scrabble
00:32:09,00:32:12,"is that last year, OK, was added."
00:32:12,00:32:14,"And apparently, this was very controversial."
00:32:14,00:32:15,Yeah.
00:32:15,00:32:17,"OK, you agree."
00:32:17,00:32:17,"I do, actually."
00:32:17,00:32:18,Do you why?
00:32:18,00:32:21,Because isn't one of the things about Scrabble
00:32:21,00:32:23,that you're not allowed acronyms?
00:32:23,00:32:25,"OK, oh my god, Andy, I can't believe you're"
00:32:25,00:32:26,on this side of the argument.
00:32:26,00:32:29,"OK, has not been an elitonism for like a hundred years."
00:32:29,00:32:31,What's it's down for?
00:32:31,00:32:33,"Oh, well, there we come, the commentary."
00:32:33,00:32:35,But that's the theory that it stands for all correct.
00:32:35,00:32:36,But all with ORL.
00:32:36,00:32:38,And that's correct with OK.
00:32:38,00:32:39,"Yeah, that's correct."
00:32:39,00:32:40,OK.
00:32:40,00:32:41,It does stand for that.
00:32:41,00:32:43,"That is genuinely the first instance of OK,"
00:32:43,00:32:44,is the all correct thing.
00:32:44,00:32:47,"But there is another theory that it stands for Happy Birthday,"
00:32:47,00:32:49,but Happy is Spelt with a No.
00:32:49,00:32:50,And Birthday is Spelt with a OK.
00:32:50,00:32:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:52,00:32:57,"OK, two, you, yeah."
00:32:57,00:32:59,"But when I say OK, I am putting a full stop"
00:32:59,00:33:01,"after the O, another one after the K,"
00:33:01,00:33:04,and therefore no one should be allowed to play in Scrabble.
00:33:04,00:33:05,"Do you know what you should start doing, then?"
00:33:05,00:33:08,"You should start saying OWL, which was another thing"
00:33:08,00:33:10,"that this magazine tried to get going at the time,"
00:33:10,00:33:12,when OK took off.
00:33:12,00:33:15,So OWL was for all right.
00:33:15,00:33:17,And so it thought that OWL was going to become a thing as well.
00:33:17,00:33:18,Would you spell that?
00:33:18,00:33:21,What letters are you putting in the start of OWL?
00:33:21,00:33:23,It's OWL.
00:33:23,00:33:24,It's all misspelled.
00:33:24,00:33:25,"It's part of the satire, guys."
00:33:25,00:33:26,Comedy was different.
00:33:26,00:33:29,"I know it starts, but I'm going to start saying OWL,"
00:33:29,00:33:30,and I mean OK.
00:33:30,00:33:33,People will constantly be asking me if I'm all right.
00:33:33,00:33:33,Are you OK?
00:33:33,00:33:35,OWL.
00:33:35,00:33:35,All right.
00:33:35,00:33:38,"Yes, that's what it stands for."
00:33:38,00:33:38,Crazy.
00:33:38,00:33:40,Have you had a coffee housing?
00:33:40,00:33:41,No.
00:33:41,00:33:43,There's another practice in Scrabble.
00:33:43,00:33:44,It's not a frowned upon practice in Scrabble.
00:33:44,00:33:45,Can you guess what it is?
00:33:45,00:33:46,Coffee housing.
00:33:46,00:33:48,Is it when you shove the tiles up your ass?
00:33:48,00:33:50,"Like, we all do it a coffee house."
00:33:50,00:33:53,But where's your connection to that?
00:33:53,00:33:54,It's frowned upon.
00:33:54,00:33:56,"I was just thinking, you saw that you might do a Scrabble"
00:33:56,00:33:57,that's frowned upon.
00:33:57,00:33:58,"Yeah, but it's true."
00:33:58,00:34:02,"Is it, you can feel that on the tiles in the bag, aren't you?"
00:34:02,00:34:02,"Yeah, you can."
00:34:02,00:34:04,These have been in an ass.
00:34:04,00:34:06,"If I go to a coffee house, I give them my name"
00:34:06,00:34:08,and they spell it incorrectly every time.
00:34:08,00:34:11,"So is it putting down a word which is correctly spelled,"
00:34:11,00:34:13,incorrectly spelled and saying it's correct?
00:34:13,00:34:13,That's a rip.
00:34:13,00:34:14,That's actually so good.
00:34:14,00:34:16,Better than what it is.
00:34:16,00:34:17,That's a lovely explanation.
00:34:17,00:34:20,Coffee housing is just distracting your opponents
00:34:20,00:34:22,with chat about their day or anything else.
00:34:22,00:34:24,Put any foot up your ass recently.
00:34:24,00:34:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:26,00:34:27,That's quite good.
00:34:27,00:34:28,That's a good idea.
00:34:28,00:34:29,That's amazing.
00:34:29,00:34:31,This podcast is all coffee housing.
00:34:31,00:34:33,"No Scrabble, isn't it?"
00:34:33,00:34:34,It's like a game of Scrabble where the coffee housing
00:34:34,00:34:35,got out of hand.
00:34:35,00:34:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:38,00:34:42,"There's a blog which I really like called ""Taiwiki with me."""
00:34:42,00:34:45,"And the person who runs it is called ""Minister to Stan."""
00:34:45,00:34:49,"And they play a game of Scrabble, which I think is really good."
00:34:49,00:34:50,They do a few different things.
00:34:50,00:34:51,"First of all, double bagging."
00:34:51,00:34:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:54,00:34:56,Brand upon.
00:34:56,00:34:58,"Well, you keep all your consonants in one bag"
00:34:58,00:35:00,and all your vowels in another bag.
00:35:00,00:35:02,And so you can pick the ones that you want depending
00:35:02,00:35:03,on what you've got on your rack.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"Oh, like countdown."
00:35:05,00:35:05,Yeah.
00:35:05,00:35:07,"That's a good idea, right?"
00:35:07,00:35:09,"And they have another one which is open booking, which"
00:35:09,00:35:11,means you're allowed to have the dictionary open and check
00:35:11,00:35:13,things as you go along.
00:35:13,00:35:15,And they also spin their racks around
00:35:15,00:35:18,to ask the other person for help if you get stuck.
00:35:18,00:35:21,And they play the game where the two people
00:35:21,00:35:24,"playing got a combined amount of 2,000 points."
00:35:24,00:35:25,That's so good.
00:35:25,00:35:27,I just think it's a more friendly game.
00:35:27,00:35:27,It is.
00:35:27,00:35:29,It's more coffee-housey.
00:35:29,00:35:30,Yeah.
00:35:30,00:35:30,That is good.
00:35:30,00:35:33,I think I would play Scrabble more if I was allowed to do those things.
00:35:33,00:35:36,"Oh, no one let you play Scrabble with them anyway."
00:35:36,00:35:37,"It's cool, didn't they?"
00:35:37,00:35:37,I don't know what that means.
00:35:37,00:35:38,It's not a cool sport.
00:35:38,00:35:39,Yeah.
00:35:39,00:35:40,It's not like it's different.
00:35:40,00:35:42,I don't know if it's a Scrabble class.
00:35:42,00:35:43,"It's so cool, Alan."
00:35:43,00:35:44,It's cool.
00:35:44,00:35:45,That's really very nice.
00:35:45,00:35:48,It's a playscrabble with me.
00:35:48,00:35:49,That was my dream.
00:35:49,00:35:52,Go learn to the Scrabble team.
00:35:52,00:35:53,I have a few things on Po.
00:35:53,00:35:54,"Oh, let's go do it."
00:35:54,00:35:54,Should we go Po?
00:35:54,00:35:55,Ow.
00:35:55,00:36:00,All right.
00:36:00,00:36:00,Wow.
00:36:00,00:36:03,"This is going to get incredibly annoying very fast, isn't it?"
00:36:03,00:36:07,"So the Gold Bug, which was the initial short story that was written,"
00:36:07,00:36:10,that inspired butts.
00:36:10,00:36:15,So Po had-- basically what it was was that was a code that he'd worked out.
00:36:15,00:36:20,"And he, the same method, kind of looked through bunches of books and papers to see what"
00:36:20,00:36:22,a recurring letter was to give them this form.
00:36:22,00:36:27,And he was quite a big code setter back in the day for the newspapers he worked for.
00:36:27,00:36:31,"He used to do a thing of setting out a challenge of saying to the readers, send me a code, anything"
00:36:31,00:36:33,"cryptic, and I will solve it."
00:36:33,00:36:35,And he would publish his findings.
00:36:35,00:36:38,He'd publish the solutions in the next week's paper.
00:36:38,00:36:39,Yeah.
00:36:39,00:36:40,It's a lovely idea.
00:36:40,00:36:42,And he used to set them as well and give them out to the readers.
00:36:42,00:36:46,"And he was shocked when even one person was able to crack them, because he thought he was"
00:36:46,00:36:48,so good at setting these codes aside of him.
00:36:48,00:36:49,I had no idea about that.
00:36:49,00:36:50,Yeah.
00:36:50,00:36:53,"He had the bit of the moat sets about him, didn't he?"
00:36:53,00:36:57,"When he published a raven, it was basically an overnight success."
00:36:57,00:37:01,"Everyone thought it was amazing, turned him into a celebrity, and everyone said how brilliant"
00:37:01,00:37:02,it was.
00:37:02,00:37:06,And he told a friend it was the greatest poem that was ever written.
00:37:06,00:37:07,Yeah.
00:37:07,00:37:08,Wow.
00:37:08,00:37:13,"There were loads of weird parodies of the raven, though, which came up straight away."
00:37:13,00:37:16,"So as soon as he published the raven, he became super famous."
00:37:16,00:37:17,It became super famous.
00:37:17,00:37:22,"But also published work, The Gazelle, The Whipple Wheel, The Turkey, The Polcat."
00:37:22,00:37:26,"And Lincoln actually, President Lincoln, read and enjoyed the Polcat, the pern, the Polcat"
00:37:26,00:37:30,"before he read the raven, which was a piss take of the raven."
00:37:30,00:37:34,"There's a few people that believe that the raven was not originally going to be a raven,"
00:37:34,00:37:36,that it was going to be a parrot.
00:37:36,00:37:37,"Well, because it can talk."
00:37:37,00:37:38,"Yeah, exactly."
00:37:38,00:37:42,It was a dark and stormy night.
00:37:42,00:37:48,"Yeah, Poe wrote a philosophy of composition, a piece, and in it, he said, arose the idea of"
00:37:48,00:37:53,a non-reasoning creature capable of speech and very naturally a parrot in the first instance
00:37:53,00:37:54,suggested itself.
00:37:54,00:37:59,"And then he later on says, but then it's superseded with the raven along the lines, but we might've"
00:37:59,00:38:00,"had, yeah, a parrot."
00:38:00,00:38:03,"It just definitely does another same kind of marketing, spooky vibe, does it?"
00:38:03,00:38:04,"No, no, no."
00:38:04,00:38:05,There's one theory.
00:38:05,00:38:11,"I think this might be true, actually, that the raven that he writes about was Charles Dickens'"
00:38:11,00:38:12,raven.
00:38:12,00:38:13,Is that right?
00:38:13,00:38:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:38:14,00:38:17,"So Charles Dickens had a raven called Grip, the Knowing."
00:38:17,00:38:19,And he was a character in Barnaby Rudge.
00:38:19,00:38:24,"And when Edgar Allan Poe reviewed Barnaby Rudge, he thought that this raven was an amazing"
00:38:24,00:38:25,part of it.
00:38:25,00:38:29,"And the theory is that the raven in his poem was from that, and that's why he changed it"
00:38:29,00:38:30,from a parrot.
00:38:30,00:38:31,Wow.
00:38:31,00:38:33,So he cast the raven from someone else's boi.
00:38:33,00:38:34,Incredible.
00:38:34,00:38:35,That's awesome.
00:38:35,00:38:39,"I love Winston Smith in 1984, I'm going to bring him into my book and use him."
00:38:39,00:38:40,But it's not like that.
00:38:40,00:38:41,It's the raven from Barnaby.
00:38:41,00:38:43,What a weird review that must have been.
00:38:43,00:38:44,"Poe, did you read any of the rest of it?"
00:38:44,00:38:49,It's like reviewing Harry Potter and just talking about headwig the entire time.
00:38:49,00:38:51,That's incredible.
00:38:51,00:38:52,Yeah.
00:38:52,00:38:56,"I mean, his reviews were a bit weird, though, aren't they?"
00:38:56,00:38:59,He liked to slag people off quite a lot in his reviews.
00:38:59,00:39:04,"He reviewed a collection of poems by William W. Lord in 1845, saying, ""The only remarkable"
00:39:04,00:39:10,"things about Mr. Lord's compositions are their remarkable conceit, ignorance, impudence,"
00:39:10,00:39:12,"platitudes, stupidity and bombast."""
00:39:12,00:39:13,Wow.
00:39:13,00:39:16,But he only read the bit about the sparrow at the start.
00:39:16,00:39:20,He had his struggles in life.
00:39:20,00:39:25,"He died aged 40 of drink, really, drink and poverty."
00:39:25,00:39:27,He was incredibly broke.
00:39:27,00:39:30,"Well, his death was quite spooky in itself, wasn't it?"
00:39:30,00:39:31,Yeah.
00:39:31,00:39:35,"He was found in the street, wasn't he, and clothes that didn't quite fit him, and he was"
00:39:35,00:39:39,"taken to hospital, and he was raving with tough times for Poe."
00:39:39,00:39:42,"A lot of people thought when he was found, he was drunk, and maybe he'd been on a drinking"
00:39:42,00:39:43,binge.
00:39:43,00:39:46,"But then his family and friends said, ""Well, it's pretty unlikely because he couldn't"
00:39:46,00:39:47,really drink.
00:39:47,00:39:51,"If you gave him one glass of wine, he'd go tantos, so it didn't seem likely that he'd"
00:39:51,00:39:52,"been on some binge."""
00:39:52,00:39:53,Yeah.
00:39:53,00:39:56,"I think it's really even more controversial than that, really."
00:39:56,00:39:59,"So he was found in someone else's clothes, didn't even fit him."
00:39:59,00:40:04,"And people think he was cooped, which is there was an election on the day that he was found"
00:40:04,00:40:05,dead.
00:40:05,00:40:08,"And so some people think that he was cooped as in, this was a weird thing that was practiced"
00:40:08,00:40:12,"where people who were campaigning for a certain politician would literally coop people up, would"
00:40:12,00:40:16,"drug them, would force feed them, loads and loads of alcohol, and would drag them from one"
00:40:16,00:40:20,"polling booth to the next, force them to vote, and then leave them abandoned, and they'd"
00:40:20,00:40:23,"change their clothes as they went, so they looked like they were a different person."
00:40:23,00:40:31,"So his reputation as being an alcoholic and a bit of a disaster, walking disaster is mostly"
00:40:31,00:40:32,undeserved.
00:40:32,00:40:36,"It's this weird myth that came about as soon as he died, and it was spread by this guy"
00:40:36,00:40:42,"called the Reverend Rufus Wilmot Grizzled, and it only happened because so he reviewed,"
00:40:42,00:40:47,"so po-reviewed one of Grizzled's poems, very badly a few years earlier, and then po-sighted"
00:40:47,00:40:52,"having an affair with this lady that Grizzled fancied, and then po-died."
00:40:52,00:40:58,"And for some reason that no one knows, Poe's aunt made Grizzled the executor of his will,"
00:40:58,00:41:01,"and made him the executor of all his papers, and so he was in charge of his papers, and he"
00:41:01,00:41:06,"forged a bunch of shit, and he wrote this biography of Poe, which slandered him, and basically"
00:41:06,00:41:11,"he said he was this opium addicted, crazy drunken, poverty-stricken, he deserted the army, expelled"
00:41:11,00:41:13,"from university, none of this stuff was true."
00:41:13,00:41:19,"He wrote his obituary as well, he had the line, ""Will start or many, but few will be grieved"
00:41:19,00:41:24,"by it, talking of his death."" It's just a full-on guy."
00:41:24,00:41:31,"The Baltimore Ravens are an American football team, and their name comes after the Raven novel,"
00:41:31,00:41:32,because Poe lived in Baltimore.
00:41:32,00:41:33,Departum?
00:41:33,00:41:39,"Oh god, it's a sharp poem, it's a long novel, I don't know what it is."
00:41:39,00:41:43,"A novel to James, well this is more than two pages, I mean novel."
00:41:43,00:41:47,"And so they get their name from the poem, the Raven, the Baltimore Ravens, because Poe lived"
00:41:47,00:41:53,"in Baltimore, and in 2001 they won the Super Bowl, we just had the Super Bowl last night"
00:41:53,00:41:58,"as we record this, and in 2001 the Baltimore Ravens won the Super Bowl, and they won it because"
00:41:58,00:42:04,"they had a great defense, and ESPN said, ""Quoth the Ravens, never score."""
00:42:04,00:42:05,"Oh, nice."
00:42:05,00:42:06,Very strong.
00:42:06,00:42:07,Yeah.
00:42:07,00:42:15,"Well, it will be by the time I've edited it."
00:42:15,00:42:17,"Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts."
