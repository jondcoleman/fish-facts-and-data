00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 Hey everyone, before we begin this week's episode of Fish, we just want to let you know something hugely exciting.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,280
 One of us has our first debut novel out this week.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,080
 That is correct. Which one could it be?

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,000
 Andrew Hunter Murray. It's Andrew Hunter Murray.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,080
 Oh, it's that guy.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,480
 It's that guy. He has written a debut thriller novel. It's called The Last Day.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,880
 I've read it. It's unbelievably good.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,800
 It's really great. So it's kind of this sci-fi dystopian future where the world has gradually stopped.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,480
 Spinning. Half of it's plunged into darkness, half of it's bathed in light.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,480
 It's impossible to live in any of those areas. But what about the middle sliver?

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,480
 It's sort of half light, half dark.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,640
 That's where the novel takes place.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,200
 It's wonderful, boldly imagined and beautifully written.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,600
 The best future shock thriller for years.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,320
 Those aren't my words. There's a Lee Child's words.

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,760
 Lee Child. And look, I know a lot of people respect Lee Child's view,

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,160
 but my view may be even more important to some.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,000
 And genuinely, couldn't believe it, Andy, can actually write incredibly well.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,760
 Absolutely. It's a stunning original thriller.

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,360
 It's set in a world of tomorrow that make you think about what's happening today.

21
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,920
 Not my words. Harlan Coben.

22
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,440
 Harlan Coben said that about Andy.

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,880
 You may be beginning to think that Dan has no words of his own.

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,840
 And even more exciting news is that you can actually buy this book.

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,280
 It's available to buy in what we call bookshops, all of them, or on the internet.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,080
 And if you want to listen to it, there's an audiobook available.

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,200
 And it's narrated by Gemma Wheelan of Game of Thrones.

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,840
 If that's not a mark of quality, I don't know what it is.

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,720
 Go get it, buy it, read it, listen to it, do it now.

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,480
 That's right. The last day by Andrew Hunter Murray, a fabulous achievement.

31
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,480
 Not my words. Steven Fry.

32
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,520
 Oh, Jesus Christ.

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,080
 Okay.

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,960
 On with the show.

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,560
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,520
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,800
 My name is Dan Shriver.

38
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,680
 I am sitting here with James Hartkin, Anna Chazinski, and Andrew Hunter Murray.

39
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,200
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

40
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,560
 from the last seven days.

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,600
 And in a particular order, here, we go.

42
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,840
 Starting with you, Chazinski.

43
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,800
 My fact this week is that after being stuck at an opera that went on

44
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,560
 twice as long as the scheduled running time, Emperor Joseph II of Austria banned on course.

45
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,640
 So yeah, this was 1786.

46
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,240
 It was the marriage of Figaro.

47
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,200
 Very good.

48
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,400
 No disrespect to that.

49
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,560
 I'm sure he emphasized, but it did go on twice the length it was supposed to,

50
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,360
 because almost every single scene was on-cord.

51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,480
 That's so funny.

52
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,520
 It's rough.

53
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,160
 If you've got kids to get home to, it's difficult.

54
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,400
 Yep.

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,520
 So anyway, he went, the emperor went, and he thought that was fine,

56
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,160
 but he immediately afterwards set put up kind of bills in theaters saying that

57
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,120
 no piece of music should be on-cord henceforth.

58
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,680
 And to be clear, he said no piece of music for more than a single voice.

59
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,600
 So if you are singing your solitary little solo, you can maybe get away with it,

60
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,760
 but basically you couldn't do anything else.

61
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,480
 It's an amazing thing, the idea of an on-cord mid-show,

62
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,560
 or even at the beginning of the show and just carrying on.

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

64
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,720
 I've never heard of that before.

65
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,320
 They just used to interrupt shows.

66
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,240
 I mean, this was how on-cords worked until apparently up to the 1930s.

67
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,840
 In theatre, it was common.

68
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,760
 Like, if you were watching a scene and you liked it,

69
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,640
 you'd just shout on-cord and continuity couldn't happen,

70
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,080
 because you'd have to do the scene again.

71
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,760
 Sometimes there'd be like a song that audience really liked sort of in scene two.

72
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,360
 And then an hour later, they decide to on-cord that song from scene two,

73
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,520
 and they'd be like, "Hey, play, hit me baby again."

74
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,040
 And you'd have to go back.

75
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,600
 What's hit me baby is that Britney Spears opera?

76
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,720
 Yeah, the Britney Spears opera, I think it was 1810.

77
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,320
 One more time!

78
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,920
 But there was a thing where you would sing an on-cord,

79
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,680
 which wasn't even part of the opera you were seeing.

80
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,760
 So some singers in the 19th and even 20th century would sing an on-cord,

81
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,520
 which is just a little musical bonus unrelated to the piece you'd just seen,

82
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,800
 or the opera you'd just seen.

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,840
 And they would do on-cord after on-cord that was not in the opera.

84
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,280
 So there was a Polish tenor, whose name was Jan Kiepura,

85
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,520
 and he made sure there was a piano in the wings,

86
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,960
 just in case he needed it for an on-cord.

87
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,200
 For an on-cord, but playing something else.

88
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,360
 Just for "Pitching" his other way.

89
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,320
 It'd be like you suddenly reading a chapter of your novel mid show right now for us.

90
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,680
 I don't do that, Ali.

91
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,520
 It was a dark and stormy night.

92
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,000
 Wow, okay.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,280
 The last time I heard you do that accent was Old John the Pooh smuggler.

94
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,000
 He's a main character of the song.

95
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,160
 He's a Pooh smuggling ring, that's wide open.

96
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,080
 Oh, that's disgusting.

97
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,160
 Anyway.

98
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,680
 Any who onto opera?

99
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,480
 Yes, guys.

100
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,120
 Oh, Figaro was extremely popular, wasn't it?

101
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,640
 Yeah, it was. It was a huge deal.

102
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,840
 Well, I think it was popular eventually.

103
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,400
 Apparently the first performance, they didn't love.

104
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,600
 They didn't know what to make of it.

105
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,000
 So this was in Vienna when it was first performed.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,400
 And apparently it was ruined by Heklers,

107
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,840
 so someone who is there wrote that it was destroyed by

108
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,320
 obstreparous louts in the uppermost story,

109
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,720
 exerting their hired lungs with all their might

110
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,320
 to deafen the singer's audience alike.

111
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,200
 Oh, wow.

112
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,680
 What sort of, is that from a rival composer?

113
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,720
 I assume so, yeah.

114
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,440
 What's it?

115
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,080
 And when it was played in Prague a bit later,

116
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,520
 it was really popular.

117
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,320
 So Mozart said here they talk about nothing but Figaro.

118
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,680
 Nothing is played, sung or whistled, but Figaro.

119
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,160
 No opera is drawing like Figaro.

120
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,840
 Nothing, but Figaro.

121
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,640
 All right, mate.

122
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,440
 Oh.

123
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,640
 Get over yourself.

124
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,280
 Yeah, I didn't even know it was a play before.

125
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,080
 Yeah. It was an opera, and it was written by a man

126
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,360
 called Bommache, who is seriously interesting.

127
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,120
 He's the best. He's incredible.

128
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,440
 Because it was quite an incendiary play.

129
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,680
 It had lots of stuff about the aristocracy being rubbish

130
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,600
 and layabouts and useless.

131
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,640
 And it was all pretty, this was soon before the French Revolution.

132
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,400
 So Louis XVI banned performances of the play,

133
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,840
 which the opera was based on.

134
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,520
 Yeah, he said, actually, he said,

135
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,200
 for this play not to be a danger,

136
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,600
 the Bastille would have to be torn down first.

137
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,160
 Oh.

138
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,680
 And then everyone went, oh, that's an idea.

139
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,400
 He actually referenced himself in a later play.

140
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,520
 So I think it was in Don Giovanni in Act II.

141
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,040
 Mozart, which Mozart also wrote,

142
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,840
 which also was an adaptation of the Bommache, Don Giovanni.

143
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,640
 Really?

144
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,680
 He played some tuffle music, which is like table music,

145
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,120
 and it's like background music,

146
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,120
 and I see my people are chatting away.

147
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,640
 And as part of the table music,

148
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,680
 he used a marriage of Figaro melody

149
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,760
 that he got the wind plays to play.

150
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,960
 So in his later opera was a cool back to his previous opera.

151
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,760
 Wow.

152
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,240
 It was so far up his own ass, by that point.

153
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,480
 I love, there's another character who's a part of this story,

154
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,120
 is Lorenzo Deponte, who was, he wrote the words to the opera.

155
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,440
 So all the trilogy of those plays were done as a collaboration.

156
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,400
 He was the Bernie Taupin to Mozart's Elton John.

157
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,160
 He was a big deal in his time, Lorenzo.

158
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,880
 He was the court poet to Joseph II.

159
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,760
 So that was great.

160
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,560
 But then Joseph II died and Mozart died.

161
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,560
 And he got banned from Austria.

162
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,880
 And he had to flee where he moved to America

163
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,560
 and opened a grocery store.

164
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,360
 He lived in New York.

165
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,120
 He lived in Pennsylvania, New Jersey.

166
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,680
 In those times, he had a grocery store, a bookstore,

167
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,080
 a traveling general store, a jinder stillery.

168
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,920
 So did he, he didn't bring the stores with him?

169
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,760
 He did, he opened up a new store and every new place.

170
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,880
 Yeah, every new place, yeah.

171
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,360
 And then the general traveling store, I don't know about that,

172
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,800
 because that was on wheels, I assume.

173
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,400
 So he might have brought that everywhere.

174
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,360
 Traveling store, yeah.

175
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
 And he opened the first opera house in New York,

176
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,720
 but it closed after two seasons.

177
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,440
 And it was the first opera house to play Italian opera.

178
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,360
 But unfortunately, yeah, it failed.

179
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,320
 But amazing character.

180
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,840
 Yeah, and he was actually really important

181
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,120
 with the marriage of Figaro, wasn't he?

182
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,960
 Because Mozart wanted it to be close to the original story,

183
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,480
 which, like Andy says, was really anti aristocracy.

184
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,640
 And it was about, was it about like someone

185
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,800
 who wants to share some guy's girlfriend?

186
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,440
 And he's the Lord.

187
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,480
 And he's like, well, I'm the Lord.

188
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,840
 So I'm allowed to share your girlfriend.

189
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,440
 And then the guy who's the girlfriend's boyfriend is like,

190
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,320
 oh, you're only there because you're rich, you idiot.

191
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,360
 And then all the people--

192
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,120
 Are you talking about these tenders?

193
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,360
 Yeah, because then the other guy goes, you slag!

194
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,800
 You slag?

195
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,400
 He's not worth it, Figaro.

196
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,600
 He's not worth it.

197
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,560
 But there was loads of quotes about why the aristocracy

198
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,640
 were bad in this original story.

199
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,400
 And it was Deponte who said, let's get rid of all those passages.

200
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,720
 Let's just stick with the comedy bit, with Barry and Janine.

201
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,440
 Let's just stick with those ones and get rid of the Mitchell's.

202
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,480
 Yeah, wow.

203
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,160
 It's about-- I read the plot of it today,

204
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,560
 because I've never heard the music except, obviously,

205
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,120
 I have when you press play on a Spotify list.

206
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,600
 It's like, oh, that most famous song ever, kind of thing.

207
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,120
 Is that what your Spotify lists are?

208
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,440
 They are now. It's that and Arianna Grande at the moment.

209
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,160
 Don't ask me why.

210
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,200
 It's Arias and Arianna.

211
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,840
 I know, pretty.

212
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,200
 Lovely.

213
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,760
 So I'd never heard it before, and I read the plot today.

214
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,840
 And it does read like a carry-on film.

215
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,120
 Like, it's total force.

216
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,200
 There's stuff of having to hide in the bedrooms.

217
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,120
 Very funny, just even by plot.

218
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,000
 I can't wait to see it.

219
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 It becomes less funny on stage.

220
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,120
 I doubt it, please.

221
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,000
 Apparently, I read that the play was so popular,

222
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 the original play that in France,

223
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,080
 women would have lines from the play

224
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,200
 and scribed on their fans.

225
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,320
 Oh, cool.

226
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,400
 Yeah, so that became, like, sort of merchandise,

227
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,240
 but bootleg and not official, not official merch.

228
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,000
 It's awful that when you said fans,

229
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,960
 I thought you were going to say something, yeah.

230
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,720
 God, I thought you was going to say Fanny's as well.

231
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,000
 Yeah, I was going to say,

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 how on earth you would scribe words for a play on your Fanny?

233
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,720
 You need a mirror.

234
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,800
 The only person you can read it is Leonardo da Vinci.

235
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,520
 Do you guys know what the French for encore is?

236
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,960
 Concorde.

237
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,400
 Concorde.

238
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,280
 So it's not on court.

239
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,160
 It's not on court.

240
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,080
 Oh, it's not on court in the French accent.

241
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,480
 It's not on court in any accent.

242
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,280
 No, it's B.

243
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,160
 So on court is the French for, can I have some more?

244
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,720
 But actually the English language,

245
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,720
 nicked it from Italy's Angcora

246
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,600
 and changed it to on court,

247
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,040
 thinking that sounds nice in French.

248
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,200
 But the French say B as in a second time.

249
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,080
 Do it a second time.

250
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,200
 Like a second time, okay.

251
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,680
 Yeah.

252
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,280
 Not like a Buzzy family.

253
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,440
 No, like we've heard it once A.

254
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,240
 Let's hear it B.

255
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,840
 Oh, that would be good.

256
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,720
 It's interesting because so modern day on court

257
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,160
 you don't repeat the material.

258
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,760
 It's bits you haven't played.

259
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,120
 So I don't know.

260
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,520
 I once went to watch the band Junia Senior

261
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,120
 and they only had one song.

262
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,480
 It was called "Move Your Feet"

263
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,600
 that everyone had heard of

264
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,960
 and they played it four times.

265
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,680
 Did they?

266
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,160
 Wow.

267
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,840
 There are occasional times of that happens.

268
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,240
 In 1926, there was a musical called "Betsy"

269
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,000
 which is a Roger's and Hart musical.

270
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,360
 But there was a song that was added to it

271
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,440
 the last minute which was Irving Berlin song

272
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,040
 and it was "Blue Skies"

273
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,080
 and it was so popular that at the end of the night

274
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,840
 they requested the song again

275
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,440
 and the song by Bell Baker

276
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,240
 but they requested it in total 24 times.

277
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,240
 She did it on on court 24 times

278
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,720
 and on the final time that she was singing it

279
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,520
 she was so dazed from singing it she forgot the words.

280
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,440
 And while she forgot the words,

281
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
 suddenly a voice could be heard from the front row

282
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,800
 which was Irving Berlin

283
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
 who was filling in for the missing lyrics

284
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,080
 and singing the rest of the song for.

285
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,720
 No way.

286
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,840
 Quite a cool opening night.

287
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,360
 It must have been some people in the crowd

288
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,760
 who were saying after maybe the 20th time.

289
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,000
 Well, we've all had a really good time.

290
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,320
 Yeah, it's cool.

291
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,160
 That is hell.

292
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,520
 You've got to turn it down.

293
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,520
 You've got to learn to say no to an encore, I think,

294
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,480
 in that instance.

295
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,600
 There's just no way of voting.

296
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,080
 There's no, if a few people really want an encore

297
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,120
 then you might get one.

298
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,000
 It's hard.

299
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,840
 Well, there used to be a thing, in fact,

300
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,520
 where in the 19th century

301
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
 at these choral festivals that happened

302
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,360
 it was so irritating that, you know,

303
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,800
 you kept getting loads of oncours

304
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,480
 that the encore decision was reserved

305
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,160
 for a single person,

306
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
 like the bishop, or the male, or whoever.

307
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,920
 And they could decide what they wanted to hear again.

308
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,000
 Just because you talked about the bishop.

309
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,480
 Yeah.

310
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,240
 Do you know that just after the marriage of Figaro started,

311
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,280
 Beaumache got arrested and got sent to prison?

312
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,960
 And that was because there was a protest outside of the play

313
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,200
 which involved the Archbishop of Paris.

314
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,160
 And he apparently assaulted the Archbishop of Paris

315
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,120
 and got sent to prison for bashing the bishop.

316
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,840
 Shut up.

317
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,840
 That's where we get the phrase from.

318
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,280
 And was he assaulting him?

319
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,240
 But had he said, had he banned an encore or something?

320
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,480
 Well, the Archbishop was trying to stop people

321
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,840
 from going into the theatre

322
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,640
 because he was like, stop this filth kind of thing.

323
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,720
 So he was like, stopping anyone from going in

324
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,320
 and he was like, how can you stop these ladies

325
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,280
 from coming in? You shouldn't.

326
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,520
 And he kind of bashed him out of the way.

327
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,560
 And then he got arrested.

328
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,160
 It's freezing for a bruising.

329
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,480
 Dashing for a bashing.

330
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,080
 He was dashing for a bashing.

331
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,760
 Anyway, Andy's novel is available.

332
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,680
 Oh, goodbye, Scott.

333
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,680
 It's a dark star in the night.

334
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,480
 It's a combination of Dr. Seuss and the Pirates of Pensans.

335
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:13,160
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

336
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,080
 And that is James.

337
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,320
 OK, my fact this week is that humans

338
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,200
 have transported European earthworms

339
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,200
 to every continent on the planet except Antarctica.

340
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,360
 In a process, some worm experts are calling global warming.

341
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,680
 It's really good.

342
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,840
 Delivered that like as a Fox News headly, really?

343
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,760
 Well, this was an amazing article

344
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,320
 that I read in the Atlantic by Julia Rosen.

345
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,400
 And it's all about earthworms.

346
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,000
 And the fact that mainly if you go to North America,

347
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,640
 they had a big glacial ice sheet over there

348
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,240
 about 10,000 years ago.

349
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
 And it killed off all of the worms.

350
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,920
 And so you would think there'd be no worms there,

351
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,520
 but actually there are worms there.

352
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
 And that's because humans have brought them over.

353
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,760
 And this is actually bad news for the environment

354
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,360
 because worms are pretty good for the environment in some ways.

355
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,760
 But if you put them in a place where they're not supposed to be,

356
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,320
 then like all animals, that's not a good thing.

357
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,080
 I like the tone in which it's--

358
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,960
 Here's Tom with the weather.

359
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,760
 No, but it is surprising.

360
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,280
 Because I would have thought that I thought

361
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,960
 before researching this fact that worms were good

362
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,800
 pretty much wherever you had them.

363
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,080
 Because they--

364
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,200
 What are they doing in the UK?

365
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,440
 They make your soil better.

366
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,240
 Yeah.

367
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,600
 And they make channels in it.

368
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,520
 Some people say it's a bit of a myth, actually.

369
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,800
 And a worm is a symptom rather than a cause of good soil.

370
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,480
 So they go to good soil?

371
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,280
 Is the idea?

372
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,480
 That's an idea.

373
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,080
 Right, that's interesting.

374
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,800
 It's a controversial issue.

375
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,920
 I don't want to get into it right now.

376
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,040
 But that's what some people say.

377
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,960
 But basically where they shouldn't be,

378
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,200
 they are-- the soil in the boreal forest

379
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,680
 in the northern half of the planet.

380
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,400
 It's the largest carbon sink at the bottom.

381
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,120
 It has 200 billion metric tons of carbon

382
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,320
 in this boreal forest.

383
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,520
 And that's not just in the trees.

384
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,400
 I didn't realize that either.

385
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,760
 Loads of it is actually in the soil.

386
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,480
 But under a tree, you might get twice as much

387
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,720
 carbon in the soil as there is in the tree itself.

388
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,000
 Which I had no idea about.

389
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,560
 And so the worms, sometimes, they eat the top layer

390
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,600
 of the soil, basically.

391
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,680
 And they just make it thinner and thinner and thinner.

392
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,080
 And then all the carbon is actually being released at the air

393
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,240
 because the worms are eating it up and creating channels.

394
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,840
 Although there is another argument

395
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,680
 that when they're making their casts,

396
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,880
 which is when you're eating soil,

397
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,680
 you kind of give out some soil poo stuff

398
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,120
 that that actually keeps in loads more carbon.

399
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,960
 So really, actually, these days,

400
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
 no one has really looked into earthworms enough

401
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,120
 to know exactly what they're doing to the environment.

402
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,360
 I didn't realize they were such a hot bed of debate.

403
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,160
 Yeah.

404
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,000
 We don't see enough of this on earth to be.

405
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,200
 Yeah.

406
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,400
 Just wait till next week.

407
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,560
 Piersmog and they'll be whining all about earthworms.

408
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,920
 But they eat seeds.

409
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,640
 They eat seeds, which you'd think would be fine

410
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,600
 because it's just their diet.

411
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,120
 But in the bits of America,

412
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,000
 north of the Mason-Dixon line and east of the Great Plains,

413
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,440
 where they used to not exist,

414
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,200
 there used to be millipedes and mites everywhere.

415
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,080
 And that's just worms.

416
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,560
 Yeah.

417
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,240
 So they're hugely invasive.

418
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,360
 And so for sure, it's quite bad for them to be up there.

419
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,480
 Because like, for instance,

420
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,120
 you've got all this bits of leaves and stuff on the floor

421
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,720
 and all the millipedes live under there,

422
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,000
 nice and happy.

423
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,840
 And then suddenly the worms come along

424
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,240
 and they just eat all of the leaves and stuff like that.

425
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,800
 And there's nowhere for the millipedes to live and they all die.

426
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,200
 And someone said in this ass-close reading,

427
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,280
 I think it was in this Atlantic article

428
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,840
 that it's like going to the African-Sovanna,

429
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,240
 taking out all the animals and just replacing them all

430
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,440
 with elephants.

431
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,440
 And just tons of elephants everywhere.

432
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,240
 Yeah.

433
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,520
 And one of the problems seems to be that we know very little about them

434
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,320
 to some extent.

435
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,160
 So it was only in 2008 that we discovered the common earthworm,

436
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,880
 which was thought to be one species, it was actually five.

437
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,080
 Wow.

438
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,120
 So that one common earthworm is different from another

439
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,280
 as a human from an ape.

440
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,800
 And in the US, I like this quote.

441
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,280
 In the US, I was reading a one article, a quote,

442
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
 which said, "Shocking me little is known about

443
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,960
 any of our native earthworms.

444
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,080
 There is only one working earthworm taxonomist

445
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,000
 in all of America."

446
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,800
 So I looked into this because I wanted to find out who it was.

447
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,000
 That's an easy job, isn't it?

448
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,200
 Of all taxonomy, oh, taxonomy, I thought it was taxidermy.

449
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,760
 [LAUGHTER]

450
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,520
 Worm taxidermy is very easy.

451
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,400
 Yeah.

452
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,280
 You're right.

453
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,280
 You just cut off the end and go, just blow out the middle.

454
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
 Yeah, yeah.

455
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,040
 So I tried to find out about who the taxonomist is.

456
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,320
 And anyway, it came, of course, this 1995 book.

457
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,720
 And I was just so impressed at the level of research.

458
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,320
 So it was about worms.

459
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,480
 And it says, there's one trained professional worm

460
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,960
 taxonomist in America.

461
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,840
 And then it says, there is sort of a second,

462
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,800
 but she's only recently trained, so not good enough.

463
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,160
 And then says, OK, there's a third expert.

464
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,440
 He was trained by his mother.

465
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,040
 And he actually works in a post office.

466
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,040
 [LAUGHTER]

467
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,520
 And then it was like, he said, "The fourth and last person

468
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,600
 in North America who has any knowledge of earthworm taxonomy

469
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
 works as a police lawyer in New Brunswick, Canada."

470
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
 Wow.

471
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,920
 This guy has actually been around every single person

472
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,320
 in America to find out if they know about earthworms.

473
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,520
 That's really impressive.

474
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,920
 So impressive.

475
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,400
 Yeah.

476
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,200
 You can get three meter long worms.

477
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,040
 That's long.

478
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,440
 Yeah, this is the Australian giant Jipsland earthworm.

479
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,640
 Up to three meters long.

480
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,200
 And apparently, they used to be very abundant in the 1800s.

481
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,920
 And if you plowed your fields, they'd

482
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,200
 be red with blood from all these worms that you'd plowed up.

483
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,360
 That's long.

484
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,920
 It's pretty messed up, yeah.

485
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,840
 They would hang from the plow's like spaghetti,

486
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,320
 someone described it as.

487
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:31,840
 Wow.

488
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,080
 And but they're quite cool.

489
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,920
 So you can hear them.

490
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,760
 They're so big and they're so vocal that when you're

491
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,160
 walking in the territory in the Jipsland area,

492
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,200
 in the territory where they live.

493
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,440
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, you're walking on the--

494
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,280
 Ow.

495
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,120
 Is that what you say vocal, is that what you mean?

496
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,440
 That's sort of what I mean.

497
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,720
 But if you walk on the ground, you can hear them squelching

498
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,120
 and squirming underfoot because they're very fast.

499
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,720
 And so they squirm away.

500
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,080
 And so if you walk, you'll hear a gurgling squelching sound.

501
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,880
 It's like they're moving through their burrows, I think,

502
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,200
 because it's like the water draining in a bath.

503
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,000
 They move through the--

504
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,800
 yeah, their bodies are slimy against the walls of their burrow.

505
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,640
 Oh, wow.

506
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
 They're a foot long when they're born.

507
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,160
 When they're born?

508
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,360
 Yeah, they're really big.

509
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,120
 Are they born in eggs?

510
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,880
 So they're in like a cocoon type thing.

511
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,360
 I don't know if they're eggs or born live.

512
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,240
 But they do-- so they have no teeth.

513
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,120
 But they do have a gizzard.

514
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,720
 Well, you know they're like a chicken.

515
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,560
 Like a chicken, yeah.

516
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,240
 At least swallow little rocks.

517
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,920
 And they use those to grind up their food inside them.

518
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,480
 Do you know how you collect worms?

519
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,320
 Because there's a worm conservation effort going on now

520
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,720
 in the worms are good for the environment lobby.

521
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,840
 So I think you tap the ground and they think there's a bird there.

522
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,160
 No, they think there's rain there.

523
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,680
 And they come up thinking there's rain.

524
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,200
 And then you just plop them out.

525
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,520
 You do do a bit of that.

526
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,800
 And we have mentioned the worm tapping before.

527
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,720
 I was actually talking about the more brutal way,

528
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,760
 which is you just shove a spade in the ass, which

529
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
 is what people used to do.

530
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,240
 And they're doing much less now.

531
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,600
 But it turns out you're just cutting them in half all the time.

532
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,520
 And that does cause a bit of an issue.

533
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,600
 Because if you're trying to get rid of them,

534
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,640
 you're just doubling the population.

535
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
 Exactly.

536
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,240
 It gets out of control.

537
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,760
 No, so what they do to avoid using the shovel now

538
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,280
 is they take DNA swabs.

539
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,320
 Because it's all about counting the population

540
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,800
 of a certain species.

541
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,560
 And so you swab the mucus from their passages.

542
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,320
 So they make these tiny channels.

543
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,880
 And scientists who are looking into earth

544
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,120
 and populations will just swab a worm tunnel.

545
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,840
 And they scrape their saliva off it.

546
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,240
 And then they measure it in a test tube.

547
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,040
 When you said swapping their passages,

548
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,080
 I thought it was like inside the body passages.

549
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,280
 It's not a small swab, isn't it?

550
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,760
 So I was thinking, worm goes, I've got my GP check up again.

551
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,560
 Worms, be a test.

552
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,920
 There's only one stair up.

553
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,960
 And the doctor uses a cocktail stick.

554
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
 Yeah.

555
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,120
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

556
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,320
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

557
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,520
 And that is my fact.

558
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,560
 My fact this week is that the most popular street in America

559
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,040
 is second street.

560
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,360
 The second most popular street is third street.

561
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,440
 And the third most popular street is first street.

562
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,680
 So--

563
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,480
 And who's on first?

564
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,880
 Yeah, so fourth is fourth, fifth is park,

565
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,280
 and sixth is fifth, just to bring you further down the list.

566
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,600
 Is there not Main Street here in any way?

567
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,920
 So there is.

568
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,840
 This is from 1993.

569
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,800
 This was the Census Bureau in America released this report.

570
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,680
 In recent years, I think it was in the 2013 sort of period.

571
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,200
 They released all new information about the general information

572
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
 about geography, topography, and so on.

573
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,000
 But they didn't do the same list that they've done before.

574
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,720
 And few people have gone through it completely

575
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,680
 and they've compiled lists.

576
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,800
 But none of them seemed to tally with the others.

577
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,640
 So Washington posted one where they said that park

578
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,360
 was the number one street.

579
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,720
 But then someone on Reddit called Darren Hawley.

580
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,120
 He did one that said Main Street was the top one.

581
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,000
 And so they think the reason first is not up there

582
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,080
 is because first and main were two versions of saying first,

583
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,040
 basically.

584
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,840
 So it knocked it down.

585
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,920
 It halved its chances.

586
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,320
 Also, the idea is that if you have a first street,

587
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
 which is your main street in your town,

588
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
 you might name it after George Washington,

589
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,320
 or Abraham Lincoln, or Donald Trump, or something like that.

590
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,080
 Yeah.

591
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,600
 Did you know that Ludford in Lincolnshire

592
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,400
 has a street named after Donald Trump?

593
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,800
 Well, I say it's named after Donald Trump.

594
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,840
 It's called Fanny Hands Lane.

595
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
 Oh, my God.

596
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,880
 Sorry.

597
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,800
 Cheap, cheap, and unfair.

598
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,400
 But actually, there's nothing rude about it.

599
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,240
 Nothing rude about Fanny Hands Lane.

600
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,080
 Yes, there is.

601
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
 The word Fanny.

602
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,560
 It has been claimed that it's affecting property prices

603
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,240
 that are having a street called Fanny Hands Lane.

604
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,800
 But the thing is, it was just named in the 19th century

605
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,040
 by a man named John Hans after his wife Fanny.

606
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,880
 No, there's nothing rude about it.

607
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,600
 Do you know in London, just down the road from here,

608
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,840
 there's a place called Knight Rider Street.

609
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,800
 Oh, no.

610
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,680
 Very cool.

611
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,720
 And do you know who it's named after?

612
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,920
 Hasselhoff, I would say.

613
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,760
 Well, the car.

614
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,520
 No, obviously not.

615
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,920
 No, it was because it was the route that Knight used to take

616
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,000
 from the Tower of London to Smithfield where

617
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,320
 Jowse were held.

618
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,520
 So Knight's would ride across that street.

619
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
 And they're talking carriages, wouldn't they?

620
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
 Yes.

621
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:15,360
 I was reading about Nicaragua's capital city of Managua.

622
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,960
 So I was trying to find out based on this fact

623
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,800
 about street names.

624
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,960
 I was trying to find out if there was anywhere

625
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,560
 where the streets have no name, like in the salt.

626
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
 Yeah.

627
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,600
 Because Bono wrote that while on a visit to Ethiopia

628
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,680
 and it's thought that it was about the poverty there

629
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,200
 and that it didn't have proper street naming system.

630
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,440
 So in Managua, in Nicaragua, it did have a modern grid system

631
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,640
 until 1972.

632
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,400
 And then there was an earthquake which destroyed lots

633
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,240
 of buildings and infrastructure.

634
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,040
 And basically, they've replaced the system

635
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,400
 with a really ramshackle one.

636
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,600
 So you might be directed to somewhere

637
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,960
 which is a block south of the Convent and half a block east

638
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,240
 of the College.

639
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,600
 And you just have to get there.

640
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
 And so taxi drivers there are amazingly good

641
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,400
 because they know all these places.

642
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,720
 And sometimes you'll ask for directions

643
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
 and you'll be told, oh yeah, go to the Blue House

644
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,520
 which is actually brown.

645
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,280
 [LAUGHTER]

646
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,920
 That's because locals know that there is a house

647
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,720
 which is brown, but it used to be blue.

648
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,240
 Wow.

649
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,720
 That's so good.

650
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,000
 I know.

651
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,800
 So Kaby's there at like next level.

652
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,120
 Or you might be told to go down and that means go west

653
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,440
 because the sun goes down in the west.

654
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,240
 Oh, that's good.

655
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,520
 It's-- I don't know how any stuff gets delivered properly.

656
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,960
 Also very difficult if you've got one

657
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,760
 of those travelling shops who were talking about it.

658
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,760
 Yeah.

659
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,840
 But it does talk about this kind of thing.

660
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,240
 It makes you really respect America

661
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,960
 for having just gone down the line.

662
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,680
 Grid system, you know, this is the number of the street.

663
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,880
 This is the number of the avenue.

664
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,760
 It's very boring.

665
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,080
 It's very effective.

666
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,880
 And so that was come up with by Penn, after him, Pennsylvania

667
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,400
 named.

668
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,680
 Not from Penn and Teller.

669
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,760
 Just magic streets into existence.

670
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,880
 So William Penn, he came up with the grid system in 1682

671
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,600
 when he founded Philadelphia, which was only founded

672
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,800
 because basically the King of England, King Charles II,

673
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,640
 was massively in debt to him and had no money to pay him.

674
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,120
 So instead said, have this random tract of land

675
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,440
 in Philadelphia.

676
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,960
 And so he gave him this land.

677
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,080
 And so Penn, famous Quaker, said of this utopian,

678
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,240
 where he wanted to be a utopian society.

679
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,960
 But he really didn't want it to be called Pennsylvania.

680
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,800
 And also Pennsylvania is not named after him.

681
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,320
 It's named after his dad.

682
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,960
 Yeah, who happens to have the same name?

683
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,880
 He was very clear.

684
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,160
 I don't want to think I'm a cocky twat.

685
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,840
 He wanted to call it New Wales, because it reminded him

686
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,520
 so much of Wales, which was very fond.

687
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,960
 Anyway, so he really didn't want it to be called named after him.

688
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,080
 And now Pennsylvania forever bears his name, which is very sad.

689
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,160
 That's cool.

690
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,080
 And they're quite good at coming up

691
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,880
 with funny names in America, aren't they?

692
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,040
 Of the streets.

693
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,840
 I know they do have lots of firsts and seconds,

694
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,280
 but there's a few funny ones.

695
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,120
 Shall we mention them before?

696
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,040
 I did say once that the number 69 road marker's always

697
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
 gets stolen, don't we?

698
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,560
 Yes.

699
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,400
 Didn't we?

700
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,200
 And there's a stoner drive in Colesville and a blunt road.

701
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,800
 And they have had people stealing their road signs all the time.

702
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,120
 But they've come up with a way of stopping that.

703
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,120
 And that is they're making them without any vowels.

704
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,160
 So what used to say stoner drive now says,

705
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,120
 ST, blank N, blank R, drive.

706
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,240
 And what used to be blunt road is now BLNT road.

707
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,680
 Do they leave the space?

708
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,520
 They leave the space.

709
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,360
 This is the space.

710
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:20,880
 Oh, wow.

711
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,280
 Because that just looks like it was made by a stoner.

712
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,320
 Yes.

713
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,280
 It just couldn't be bothered finishing it.

714
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,560
 Unfortunately, they've all been stolen by fans of only connects.

715
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

716
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,320
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

717
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,080
 And that is Andy.

718
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,960
 My fact is that the game of Scrabble

719
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,360
 is partly thanks to Edgar Allan Poe.

720
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,360
 Oh, spooky.

721
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,480
 And that's why spooky with 20 O's is actually accepted in Scrabble, isn't it?

722
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,000
 So this is about the man who invented Scrabble.

723
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,520
 His name was Alfred Mosher buts.

724
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,800
 And he--

725
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,920
 He sounds like a good time, doesn't he?

726
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,440
 Yeah.

727
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,840
 He's a good time guy.

728
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,560
 Yeah, that's Mosher buts.

729
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,480
 He was an unemployed architect.

730
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,120
 He was a sack architect in Depression era America,

731
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,400
 so early '30s.

732
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,960
 And he was trying to work out how to come up with a ball game

733
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,800
 because he thought this could be worthwhile.

734
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,680
 He thought there aren't many wordy board games at the time,

735
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,400
 which there weren't.

736
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,440
 I think he was playing.

737
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,160
 Was he playing trivial pursuit or something?

738
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,120
 He was playing some game that he absolutely hated

739
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,160
 and there must be something better than this.

740
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,520
 Yeah, exactly.

741
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,160
 And he was inspired by Manopoli as well, I think.

742
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,120
 And so he-- but he was trying to work out how to come up

743
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,120
 with a word game because he thought this might be something.

744
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,200
 And he had read, as a child, the Edgar Allan Poe story,

745
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,240
 the Gold Bug, and there's a code in that, which

746
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,320
 has to be broken.

747
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,480
 And the way to break the code is that it's

748
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,600
 based on how frequently particular letters

749
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,480
 appear in the English language.

750
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,840
 So the one that appears most is E and so on.

751
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
 And so--

752
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,280
 [LAUGHTER]

753
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,840
 And you know the rest, yeah.

754
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,720
 And so he decided to make that the system by which letters

755
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,320
 would score more or less in scramble.

756
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,720
 And he studied newspaper front pages for ages.

757
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,240
 And you can see there are photos online of his tally charts

758
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,760
 where he's methodically counting each letter,

759
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,080
 how often it appears on the front page of the New York Times,

760
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,880
 say, very dedicated.

761
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,280
 Yeah, and that's what came up with the scoring system.

762
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,240
 That's cool.

763
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,920
 He didn't really like playing his game too much by the end

764
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,800
 because his wife always beat him, Mrs. Butts.

765
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,200
 She once scoured 234 for Quixotic against him, yeah.

766
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,080
 Apparently.

767
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,360
 This-- he sounds like a sore loser,

768
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,040
 because I'd assumed it was only because he was losing it

769
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,160
 trivial pursuit that he invented scrabble and twisted it.

770
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,520
 I've got to invent some game.

771
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,360
 OK, here's a game.

772
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,560
 Whoever has a stupid name wins.

773
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,960
 They've still a log comes funny hands off the fuck's sake.

774
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,720
 They've still got the scorecard.

775
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,680
 The nephew-- there was a journalist who fell madly in love

776
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,760
 with the history of Scrabble.

777
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,720
 And he'd track down the nephew who has no interest in playing it

778
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,520
 but has an obsession with collecting all the things

779
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
 that let's--

780
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,200
 Well, so I track down Mocha Butts as an nephew, right?

781
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,680
 And in his house-- so he has everything framed.

782
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,040
 But most of it is not up on the walls.

783
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,800
 It's still in the sort of brown packaging

784
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
 that the frame has handed it over in.

785
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,720
 And one of those is the scorecard.

786
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,000
 So Mrs. Butts kept the scorecard from her Quixotic score.

787
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,520
 I think you were.

788
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,000
 There were more problems in the marriage, weren't there?

789
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,400
 If you're framing your victories over your husband--

790
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
 Well, no, actually, James is right.

791
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,480
 If you'd scored Quixotic-- and supposedly,

792
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,960
 it was across two triple word scores.

793
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,600
 I mean, it sounds like an absolute--

794
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,640
 Sorry, checks out.

795
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,640
 Yeah.

796
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,360
 Set up.

797
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,720
 Do you know who is the best Scrabble players in the world,

798
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,200
 which country?

799
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,720
 America.

800
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,880
 Yes, I know.

801
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,680
 France?

802
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,200
 No.

803
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,280
 Well, I'm going to say from an old episode,

804
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,040
 I think it's a guy from New Zealand.

805
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,040
 Ah, yes, because he managed to win the French one,

806
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,000
 didn't he, despite not being able to speak French?

807
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,680
 Yes.

808
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,960
 But no, it is Nigeria.

809
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,080
 OK, and the Nigerian Scrabble Federation,

810
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,800
 because this year said that they really

811
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,000
 need to be given more money from the government,

812
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,840
 because according to them, it's the only spot

813
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,240
 that they're the world's best at in the world

814
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
 in this Scrabble.

815
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,320
 Oh.

816
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,720
 Can I just quickly-- because we spoke about Nigel Richards

817
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,880
 in episode 79.

818
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,960
 Long time ago, this is the guy who won the French Scrabble thing.

819
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,440
 I just wanted to check on an update on him,

820
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,600
 see how he's doing in his championships.

821
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,920
 He is still the winner of the French Scrabble Championships.

822
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,000
 He won 2017, 2018, and 2019.

823
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,320
 In their elite competitions.

824
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,960
 So he's still just owning it.

825
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,360
 Yeah, how-- really how many people are competing?

826
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,720
 It's a biggie, I think.

827
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,640
 Is it, though?

828
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,480
 It's Scrabble, isn't it?

829
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,920
 Let's face it.

830
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,560
 Do you know who our Scrabble champion is?

831
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,240
 No, look.

832
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,960
 He's a great guy.

833
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,440
 He's called Alan Simmons.

834
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,840
 And he is banned from playing Scrabble as of 2017,

835
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,560
 because he cheated by peaking at the letters

836
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,760
 who are picking out the bag and then putting that back in

837
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,560
 and swapping them for other letters.

838
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,680
 That is Scrabble Champion of the UK.

839
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,480
 Wow.

840
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,760
 But that's a thing.

841
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,720
 There's a rule where I think maybe--

842
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,280
 who knows if it's thanks to Simmons or not,

843
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,120
 but there's a rule where you have to take the letters out

844
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,160
 of the bag at eye height or higher.

845
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
 Really?

846
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,200
 He was done for holding the bag too low.

847
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,560
 That's great.

848
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,360
 And there's a thing called Brailing.

849
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,160
 Have you heard this?

850
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,680
 Oh, yeah.

851
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,160
 Brailing is feeling letters as you're holding them in the bag

852
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,000
 and trying to work out what they are.

853
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,520
 Yeah.

854
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,560
 That makes sense, right?

855
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,640
 Because a blank would just be a flat surface.

856
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

857
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,240
 Yeah, that's true.

858
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,440
 But I mean, I'm not very-- I can imagine taking a long time

859
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,640
 to work out, oh, it's an E or whatever.

860
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,520
 Like, it's quite impressive that you get a--

861
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,720
 Yeah, it's not just blanks and non-blanks.

862
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,160
 OK, they're more sophisticated than that.

863
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,080
 I mean, you could say that, huh?

864
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,120
 It's no blank, yeah.

865
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,200
 I think if you're taking out three or four Scrabble tiles

866
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,040
 each time and you pick four, quickly feel them.

867
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,920
 And if there's no blank, you pick another four.

868
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,080
 That's going to over-long run.

869
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,200
 That's going to make a difference.

870
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,720
 Yeah.

871
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,800
 Yeah, your mind averages, yeah.

872
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,080
 But I do think that if you are fumbling around

873
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,360
 for what shapes the indentations and Scrabble tiles,

874
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,280
 you just need to reflect on your life.

875
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,760
 Just with your hand in the bag, you need to think,

876
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,840
 what the fuck am I doing?

877
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
 Winning.

878
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,360
 Winning.

879
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,040
 Winning.

880
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,960
 One thing that was a new exciting moment in Scrabble

881
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,600
 is that last year, OK, was added.

882
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,720
 And apparently, this was very controversial.

883
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,720
 Yeah.

884
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,080
 OK, you agree.

885
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,840
 I do, actually.

886
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,760
 Do you why?

887
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,720
 Because isn't one of the things about Scrabble

888
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,560
 that you're not allowed acronyms?

889
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,400
 OK, oh my god, Andy, I can't believe you're

890
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,640
 on this side of the argument.

891
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,720
 OK, has not been an elitonism for like a hundred years.

892
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,080
 What's it's down for?

893
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,000
 Oh, well, there we come, the commentary.

894
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,320
 But that's the theory that it stands for all correct.

895
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,920
 But all with ORL.

896
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,120
 And that's correct with OK.

897
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
 Yeah, that's correct.

898
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
 OK.

899
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
 It does stand for that.

900
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,720
 That is genuinely the first instance of OK,

901
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,760
 is the all correct thing.

902
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,920
 But there is another theory that it stands for Happy Birthday,

903
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,280
 but Happy is Spelt with a No.

904
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,680
 And Birthday is Spelt with a OK.

905
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,800
 [LAUGHTER]

906
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,040
 OK, two, you, yeah.

907
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,640
 But when I say OK, I am putting a full stop

908
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,440
 after the O, another one after the K,

909
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,320
 and therefore no one should be allowed to play in Scrabble.

910
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,640
 Do you know what you should start doing, then?

911
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,600
 You should start saying OWL, which was another thing

912
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,560
 that this magazine tried to get going at the time,

913
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,000
 when OK took off.

914
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,040
 So OWL was for all right.

915
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,560
 And so it thought that OWL was going to become a thing as well.

916
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,360
 Would you spell that?

917
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,480
 What letters are you putting in the start of OWL?

918
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,800
 It's OWL.

919
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,760
 It's all misspelled.

920
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,920
 It's part of the satire, guys.

921
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,760
 Comedy was different.

922
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,120
 I know it starts, but I'm going to start saying OWL,

923
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,400
 and I mean OK.

924
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,200
 People will constantly be asking me if I'm all right.

925
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,920
 Are you OK?

926
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,080
 OWL.

927
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,600
 All right.

928
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,280
 Yes, that's what it stands for.

929
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,800
 Crazy.

930
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,640
 Have you had a coffee housing?

931
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
 No.

932
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,160
 There's another practice in Scrabble.

933
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,680
 It's not a frowned upon practice in Scrabble.

934
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,640
 Can you guess what it is?

935
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,480
 Coffee housing.

936
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,880
 Is it when you shove the tiles up your ass?

937
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,640
 Like, we all do it a coffee house.

938
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,520
 But where's your connection to that?

939
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,440
 It's frowned upon.

940
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,280
 I was just thinking, you saw that you might do a Scrabble

941
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
 that's frowned upon.

942
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,440
 Yeah, but it's true.

943
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,000
 Is it, you can feel that on the tiles in the bag, aren't you?

944
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,800
 Yeah, you can.

945
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,520
 These have been in an ass.

946
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,920
 If I go to a coffee house, I give them my name

947
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,840
 and they spell it incorrectly every time.

948
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,320
 So is it putting down a word which is correctly spelled,

949
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,080
 incorrectly spelled and saying it's correct?

950
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,880
 That's a rip.

951
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,920
 That's actually so good.

952
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,200
 Better than what it is.

953
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,880
 That's a lovely explanation.

954
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,280
 Coffee housing is just distracting your opponents

955
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,960
 with chat about their day or anything else.

956
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,560
 Put any foot up your ass recently.

957
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,880
 [LAUGHTER]

958
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,600
 That's quite good.

959
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
 That's a good idea.

960
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,840
 That's amazing.

961
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,680
 This podcast is all coffee housing.

962
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,000
 No Scrabble, isn't it?

963
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,960
 It's like a game of Scrabble where the coffee housing

964
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,800
 got out of hand.

965
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,320
 [LAUGHTER]

966
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,480
 There's a blog which I really like called "Taiwiki with me."

967
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,440
 And the person who runs it is called "Minister to Stan."

968
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,080
 And they play a game of Scrabble, which I think is really good.

969
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,440
 They do a few different things.

970
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,880
 First of all, double bagging.

971
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,920
 [LAUGHTER]

972
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,680
 Brand upon.

973
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,800
 Well, you keep all your consonants in one bag

974
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,360
 and all your vowels in another bag.

975
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,400
 And so you can pick the ones that you want depending

976
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,880
 on what you've got on your rack.

977
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,080
 Oh, like countdown.

978
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,880
 Yeah.

979
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,000
 That's a good idea, right?

980
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,080
 And they have another one which is open booking, which

981
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,960
 means you're allowed to have the dictionary open and check

982
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,760
 things as you go along.

983
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,360
 And they also spin their racks around

984
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,600
 to ask the other person for help if you get stuck.

985
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,080
 And they play the game where the two people

986
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,800
 playing got a combined amount of 2,000 points.

987
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
 That's so good.

988
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,240
 I just think it's a more friendly game.

989
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:27,760
 It is.

990
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,080
 It's more coffee-housey.

991
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
 Yeah.

992
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,760
 That is good.

993
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,800
 I think I would play Scrabble more if I was allowed to do those things.

994
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,120
 Oh, no one let you play Scrabble with them anyway.

995
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,200
 It's cool, didn't they?

996
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,880
 I don't know what that means.

997
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,840
 It's not a cool sport.

998
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,360
 Yeah.

999
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,840
 It's not like it's different.

1000
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,240
 I don't know if it's a Scrabble class.

1001
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,280
 It's so cool, Alan.

1002
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
 It's cool.

1003
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,280
 That's really very nice.

1004
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,080
 It's a playscrabble with me.

1005
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,160
 That was my dream.

1006
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,360
 Go learn to the Scrabble team.

1007
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,400
 I have a few things on Po.

1008
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
 Oh, let's go do it.

1009
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,960
 Should we go Po?

1010
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,480
 Ow.

1011
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,080
 All right.

1012
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,880
 Wow.

1013
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,800
 This is going to get incredibly annoying very fast, isn't it?

1014
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,800
 So the Gold Bug, which was the initial short story that was written,

1015
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,600
 that inspired butts.

1016
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,440
 So Po had-- basically what it was was that was a code that he'd worked out.

1017
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,000
 And he, the same method, kind of looked through bunches of books and papers to see what

1018
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,520
 a recurring letter was to give them this form.

1019
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,560
 And he was quite a big code setter back in the day for the newspapers he worked for.

1020
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,880
 He used to do a thing of setting out a challenge of saying to the readers, send me a code, anything

1021
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,560
 cryptic, and I will solve it.

1022
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,680
 And he would publish his findings.

1023
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,560
 He'd publish the solutions in the next week's paper.

1024
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
 Yeah.

1025
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
 It's a lovely idea.

1026
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,760
 And he used to set them as well and give them out to the readers.

1027
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,280
 And he was shocked when even one person was able to crack them, because he thought he was

1028
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,640
 so good at setting these codes aside of him.

1029
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
 I had no idea about that.

1030
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
 Yeah.

1031
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,360
 He had the bit of the moat sets about him, didn't he?

1032
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,880
 When he published a raven, it was basically an overnight success.

1033
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,720
 Everyone thought it was amazing, turned him into a celebrity, and everyone said how brilliant

1034
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,720
 it was.

1035
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,520
 And he told a friend it was the greatest poem that was ever written.

1036
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,520
 Yeah.

1037
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
 Wow.

1038
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,160
 There were loads of weird parodies of the raven, though, which came up straight away.

1039
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,080
 So as soon as he published the raven, he became super famous.

1040
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,080
 It became super famous.

1041
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:22,320
 But also published work, The Gazelle, The Whipple Wheel, The Turkey, The Polcat.

1042
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,320
 And Lincoln actually, President Lincoln, read and enjoyed the Polcat, the pern, the Polcat

1043
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,000
 before he read the raven, which was a piss take of the raven.

1044
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,360
 There's a few people that believe that the raven was not originally going to be a raven,

1045
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,160
 that it was going to be a parrot.

1046
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
 Well, because it can talk.

1047
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
 Yeah, exactly.

1048
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,480
 It was a dark and stormy night.

1049
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,680
 Yeah, Poe wrote a philosophy of composition, a piece, and in it, he said, arose the idea of

1050
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,240
 a non-reasoning creature capable of speech and very naturally a parrot in the first instance

1051
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,800
 suggested itself.

1052
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,280
 And then he later on says, but then it's superseded with the raven along the lines, but we might've

1053
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,280
 had, yeah, a parrot.

1054
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,840
 It just definitely does another same kind of marketing, spooky vibe, does it?

1055
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
 No, no, no.

1056
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
 There's one theory.

1057
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:11,440
 I think this might be true, actually, that the raven that he writes about was Charles Dickens'

1058
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,440
 raven.

1059
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,440
 Is that right?

1060
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,440
 Oh, yeah.

1061
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,320
 So Charles Dickens had a raven called Grip, the Knowing.

1062
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,320
 And he was a character in Barnaby Rudge.

1063
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,640
 And when Edgar Allan Poe reviewed Barnaby Rudge, he thought that this raven was an amazing

1064
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,640
 part of it.

1065
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,200
 And the theory is that the raven in his poem was from that, and that's why he changed it

1066
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
 from a parrot.

1067
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,200
 Wow.

1068
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
 So he cast the raven from someone else's boi.

1069
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
 Incredible.

1070
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
 That's awesome.

1071
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,160
 I love Winston Smith in 1984, I'm going to bring him into my book and use him.

1072
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
 But it's not like that.

1073
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,360
 It's the raven from Barnaby.

1074
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,160
 What a weird review that must have been.

1075
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,840
 Poe, did you read any of the rest of it?

1076
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,680
 It's like reviewing Harry Potter and just talking about headwig the entire time.

1077
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,880
 That's incredible.

1078
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
 Yeah.

1079
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,160
 I mean, his reviews were a bit weird, though, aren't they?

1080
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,600
 He liked to slag people off quite a lot in his reviews.

1081
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,600
 He reviewed a collection of poems by William W. Lord in 1845, saying, "The only remarkable

1082
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:10,560
 things about Mr. Lord's compositions are their remarkable conceit, ignorance, impudence,

1083
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,840
 platitudes, stupidity and bombast."

1084
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
 Wow.

1085
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,560
 But he only read the bit about the sparrow at the start.

1086
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,000
 He had his struggles in life.

1087
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,440
 He died aged 40 of drink, really, drink and poverty.

1088
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,040
 He was incredibly broke.

1089
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,480
 Well, his death was quite spooky in itself, wasn't it?

1090
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,480
 Yeah.

1091
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,320
 He was found in the street, wasn't he, and clothes that didn't quite fit him, and he was

1092
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,160
 taken to hospital, and he was raving with tough times for Poe.

1093
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,480
 A lot of people thought when he was found, he was drunk, and maybe he'd been on a drinking

1094
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,480
 binge.

1095
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,480
 But then his family and friends said, "Well, it's pretty unlikely because he couldn't

1096
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
 really drink.

1097
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,160
 If you gave him one glass of wine, he'd go tantos, so it didn't seem likely that he'd

1098
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
 been on some binge."

1099
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
 Yeah.

1100
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,600
 I think it's really even more controversial than that, really.

1101
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,720
 So he was found in someone else's clothes, didn't even fit him.

1102
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,160
 And people think he was cooped, which is there was an election on the day that he was found

1103
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
 dead.

1104
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,600
 And so some people think that he was cooped as in, this was a weird thing that was practiced

1105
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,840
 where people who were campaigning for a certain politician would literally coop people up, would

1106
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,240
 drug them, would force feed them, loads and loads of alcohol, and would drag them from one

1107
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,080
 polling booth to the next, force them to vote, and then leave them abandoned, and they'd

1108
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,880
 change their clothes as they went, so they looked like they were a different person.

1109
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:31,200
 So his reputation as being an alcoholic and a bit of a disaster, walking disaster is mostly

1110
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,200
 undeserved.

1111
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,480
 It's this weird myth that came about as soon as he died, and it was spread by this guy

1112
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,760
 called the Reverend Rufus Wilmot Grizzled, and it only happened because so he reviewed,

1113
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,160
 so po-reviewed one of Grizzled's poems, very badly a few years earlier, and then po-sighted

1114
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,120
 having an affair with this lady that Grizzled fancied, and then po-died.

1115
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:58,060
 And for some reason that no one knows, Poe's aunt made Grizzled the executor of his will,

1116
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,800
 and made him the executor of all his papers, and so he was in charge of his papers, and he

1117
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,320
 forged a bunch of shit, and he wrote this biography of Poe, which slandered him, and basically

1118
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,640
 he said he was this opium addicted, crazy drunken, poverty-stricken, he deserted the army, expelled

1119
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,720
 from university, none of this stuff was true.

1120
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:19,160
 He wrote his obituary as well, he had the line, "Will start or many, but few will be grieved

1121
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,360
 by it, talking of his death." It's just a full-on guy.

1122
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:31,400
 The Baltimore Ravens are an American football team, and their name comes after the Raven novel,

1123
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,880
 because Poe lived in Baltimore.

1124
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,880
 Departum?

1125
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,120
 Oh god, it's a sharp poem, it's a long novel, I don't know what it is.

1126
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,840
 A novel to James, well this is more than two pages, I mean novel.

1127
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,880
 And so they get their name from the poem, the Raven, the Baltimore Ravens, because Poe lived

1128
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,320
 in Baltimore, and in 2001 they won the Super Bowl, we just had the Super Bowl last night

1129
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:58,400
 as we record this, and in 2001 the Baltimore Ravens won the Super Bowl, and they won it because

1130
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,000
 they had a great defense, and ESPN said, "Quoth the Ravens, never score."

1131
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 Oh, nice.

1132
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 Very strong.

1133
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 Yeah.

1134
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 Well, it will be by the time I've edited it.

1135
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,400
 Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.
