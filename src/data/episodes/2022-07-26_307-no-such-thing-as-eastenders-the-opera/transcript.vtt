00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hey everyone, before we begin this week's episode of Fish, we just want to let you know something hugely exciting.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.280
 One of us has our first debut novel out this week.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.080
 That is correct. Which one could it be?

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.000
 Andrew Hunter Murray. It's Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.080
 Oh, it's that guy.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.480
 It's that guy. He has written a debut thriller novel. It's called The Last Day.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.880
 I've read it. It's unbelievably good.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.800
 It's really great. So it's kind of this sci-fi dystopian future where the world has gradually stopped.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.480
 Spinning. Half of it's plunged into darkness, half of it's bathed in light.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.480
 It's impossible to live in any of those areas. But what about the middle sliver?

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.480
 It's sort of half light, half dark.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.640
 That's where the novel takes place.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.200
 It's wonderful, boldly imagined and beautifully written.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.600
 The best future shock thriller for years.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.320
 Those aren't my words. There's a Lee Child's words.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.760
 Lee Child. And look, I know a lot of people respect Lee Child's view,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.160
 but my view may be even more important to some.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.000
 And genuinely, couldn't believe it, Andy, can actually write incredibly well.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.760
 Absolutely. It's a stunning original thriller.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.360
 It's set in a world of tomorrow that make you think about what's happening today.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.920
 Not my words. Harlan Coben.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.440
 Harlan Coben said that about Andy.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.880
 You may be beginning to think that Dan has no words of his own.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.840
 And even more exciting news is that you can actually buy this book.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.280
 It's available to buy in what we call bookshops, all of them, or on the internet.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.080
 And if you want to listen to it, there's an audiobook available.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.200
 And it's narrated by Gemma Wheelan of Game of Thrones.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.840
 If that's not a mark of quality, I don't know what it is.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.720
 Go get it, buy it, read it, listen to it, do it now.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.480
 That's right. The last day by Andrew Hunter Murray, a fabulous achievement.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.480
 Not my words. Steven Fry.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.520
 Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.080
 Okay.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.960
 On with the show.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.560
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.520
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.800
 My name is Dan Shriver.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.680
 I am sitting here with James Hartkin, Anna Chazinski, and Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.200
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.560
 from the last seven days.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.600
 And in a particular order, here, we go.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.840
 Starting with you, Chazinski.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.800
 My fact this week is that after being stuck at an opera that went on

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.560
 twice as long as the scheduled running time, Emperor Joseph II of Austria banned on course.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.640
 So yeah, this was 1786.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.240
 It was the marriage of Figaro.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.200
 Very good.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.400
 No disrespect to that.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.560
 I'm sure he emphasized, but it did go on twice the length it was supposed to,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.360
 because almost every single scene was on-cord.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.480
 That's so funny.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.520
 It's rough.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.160
 If you've got kids to get home to, it's difficult.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.400
 Yep.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.520
 So anyway, he went, the emperor went, and he thought that was fine,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.160
 but he immediately afterwards set put up kind of bills in theaters saying that

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.120
 no piece of music should be on-cord henceforth.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.680
 And to be clear, he said no piece of music for more than a single voice.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.600
 So if you are singing your solitary little solo, you can maybe get away with it,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.760
 but basically you couldn't do anything else.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.480
 It's an amazing thing, the idea of an on-cord mid-show,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.560
 or even at the beginning of the show and just carrying on.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.720
 I've never heard of that before.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.320
 They just used to interrupt shows.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.240
 I mean, this was how on-cords worked until apparently up to the 1930s.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.840
 In theatre, it was common.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.760
 Like, if you were watching a scene and you liked it,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.640
 you'd just shout on-cord and continuity couldn't happen,

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.080
 because you'd have to do the scene again.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.760
 Sometimes there'd be like a song that audience really liked sort of in scene two.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.360
 And then an hour later, they decide to on-cord that song from scene two,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.520
 and they'd be like, "Hey, play, hit me baby again."

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.040
 And you'd have to go back.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.600
 What's hit me baby is that Britney Spears opera?

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.720
 Yeah, the Britney Spears opera, I think it was 1810.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.320
 One more time!

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.920
 But there was a thing where you would sing an on-cord,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.680
 which wasn't even part of the opera you were seeing.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.760
 So some singers in the 19th and even 20th century would sing an on-cord,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.520
 which is just a little musical bonus unrelated to the piece you'd just seen,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.800
 or the opera you'd just seen.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.840
 And they would do on-cord after on-cord that was not in the opera.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.280
 So there was a Polish tenor, whose name was Jan Kiepura,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.520
 and he made sure there was a piano in the wings,

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.960
 just in case he needed it for an on-cord.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.200
 For an on-cord, but playing something else.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.360
 Just for "Pitching" his other way.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.320
 It'd be like you suddenly reading a chapter of your novel mid show right now for us.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.680
 I don't do that, Ali.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.520
 It was a dark and stormy night.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.000
 Wow, okay.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.280
 The last time I heard you do that accent was Old John the Pooh smuggler.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.000
 He's a main character of the song.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.160
 He's a Pooh smuggling ring, that's wide open.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.080
 Oh, that's disgusting.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.160
 Anyway.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.680
 Any who onto opera?

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.480
 Yes, guys.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.120
 Oh, Figaro was extremely popular, wasn't it?

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.640
 Yeah, it was. It was a huge deal.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.840
 Well, I think it was popular eventually.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.400
 Apparently the first performance, they didn't love.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.600
 They didn't know what to make of it.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.000
 So this was in Vienna when it was first performed.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.400
 And apparently it was ruined by Heklers,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.840
 so someone who is there wrote that it was destroyed by

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.320
 obstreparous louts in the uppermost story,

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.720
 exerting their hired lungs with all their might

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.320
 to deafen the singer's audience alike.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.200
 Oh, wow.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.680
 What sort of, is that from a rival composer?

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.720
 I assume so, yeah.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.440
 What's it?

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.080
 And when it was played in Prague a bit later,

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.520
 it was really popular.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.320
 So Mozart said here they talk about nothing but Figaro.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.680
 Nothing is played, sung or whistled, but Figaro.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.160
 No opera is drawing like Figaro.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.840
 Nothing, but Figaro.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.640
 All right, mate.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.440
 Oh.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.640
 Get over yourself.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.280
 Yeah, I didn't even know it was a play before.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.080
 Yeah. It was an opera, and it was written by a man

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.360
 called Bommache, who is seriously interesting.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.120
 He's the best. He's incredible.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.440
 Because it was quite an incendiary play.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.680
 It had lots of stuff about the aristocracy being rubbish

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.600
 and layabouts and useless.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.640
 And it was all pretty, this was soon before the French Revolution.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.400
 So Louis XVI banned performances of the play,

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.840
 which the opera was based on.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.520
 Yeah, he said, actually, he said,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.200
 for this play not to be a danger,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.600
 the Bastille would have to be torn down first.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.160
 Oh.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.680
 And then everyone went, oh, that's an idea.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:29.400
 He actually referenced himself in a later play.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.520
 So I think it was in Don Giovanni in Act II.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.040
 Mozart, which Mozart also wrote,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.840
 which also was an adaptation of the Bommache, Don Giovanni.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.640
 Really?

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.680
 He played some tuffle music, which is like table music,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.120
 and it's like background music,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.120
 and I see my people are chatting away.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.640
 And as part of the table music,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.680
 he used a marriage of Figaro melody

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.760
 that he got the wind plays to play.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.960
 So in his later opera was a cool back to his previous opera.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.760
 Wow.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.240
 It was so far up his own ass, by that point.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.480
 I love, there's another character who's a part of this story,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.120
 is Lorenzo Deponte, who was, he wrote the words to the opera.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.440
 So all the trilogy of those plays were done as a collaboration.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.400
 He was the Bernie Taupin to Mozart's Elton John.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.160
 He was a big deal in his time, Lorenzo.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.880
 He was the court poet to Joseph II.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.760
 So that was great.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.560
 But then Joseph II died and Mozart died.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.560
 And he got banned from Austria.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.880
 And he had to flee where he moved to America

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.560
 and opened a grocery store.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.360
 He lived in New York.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.120
 He lived in Pennsylvania, New Jersey.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.680
 In those times, he had a grocery store, a bookstore,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.080
 a traveling general store, a jinder stillery.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.920
 So did he, he didn't bring the stores with him?

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.760
 He did, he opened up a new store and every new place.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.880
 Yeah, every new place, yeah.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.360
 And then the general traveling store, I don't know about that,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.800
 because that was on wheels, I assume.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.400
 So he might have brought that everywhere.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.360
 Traveling store, yeah.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.360
 And he opened the first opera house in New York,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.720
 but it closed after two seasons.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.440
 And it was the first opera house to play Italian opera.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.360
 But unfortunately, yeah, it failed.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.320
 But amazing character.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.840
 Yeah, and he was actually really important

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.120
 with the marriage of Figaro, wasn't he?

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.960
 Because Mozart wanted it to be close to the original story,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.480
 which, like Andy says, was really anti aristocracy.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.640
 And it was about, was it about like someone

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.800
 who wants to share some guy's girlfriend?

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.440
 And he's the Lord.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.480
 And he's like, well, I'm the Lord.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.840
 So I'm allowed to share your girlfriend.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.440
 And then the guy who's the girlfriend's boyfriend is like,

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.320
 oh, you're only there because you're rich, you idiot.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.360
 And then all the people--

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.120
 Are you talking about these tenders?

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.360
 Yeah, because then the other guy goes, you slag!

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.800
 You slag?

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.400
 He's not worth it, Figaro.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.600
 He's not worth it.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.560
 But there was loads of quotes about why the aristocracy

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.640
 were bad in this original story.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.400
 And it was Deponte who said, let's get rid of all those passages.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.720
 Let's just stick with the comedy bit, with Barry and Janine.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.440
 Let's just stick with those ones and get rid of the Mitchell's.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.480
 Yeah, wow.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.160
 It's about-- I read the plot of it today,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.560
 because I've never heard the music except, obviously,

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.120
 I have when you press play on a Spotify list.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.600
 It's like, oh, that most famous song ever, kind of thing.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.120
 Is that what your Spotify lists are?

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.440
 They are now. It's that and Arianna Grande at the moment.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.160
 Don't ask me why.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.200
 It's Arias and Arianna.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.840
 I know, pretty.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.200
 Lovely.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.760
 So I'd never heard it before, and I read the plot today.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.840
 And it does read like a carry-on film.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.120
 Like, it's total force.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.200
 There's stuff of having to hide in the bedrooms.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.120
 Very funny, just even by plot.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.000
 I can't wait to see it.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 It becomes less funny on stage.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.120
 I doubt it, please.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.000
 Apparently, I read that the play was so popular,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 the original play that in France,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.080
 women would have lines from the play

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.200
 and scribed on their fans.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.320
 Oh, cool.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.400
 Yeah, so that became, like, sort of merchandise,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.240
 but bootleg and not official, not official merch.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.000
 It's awful that when you said fans,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.960
 I thought you were going to say something, yeah.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.720
 God, I thought you was going to say Fanny's as well.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.000
 Yeah, I was going to say,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 how on earth you would scribe words for a play on your Fanny?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.720
 You need a mirror.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.800
 The only person you can read it is Leonardo da Vinci.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.520
 Do you guys know what the French for encore is?

00:09:59.240 --> 00:09:59.960
 Concorde.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.400
 Concorde.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.280
 So it's not on court.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.160
 It's not on court.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.080
 Oh, it's not on court in the French accent.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.480
 It's not on court in any accent.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.280
 No, it's B.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.160
 So on court is the French for, can I have some more?

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.720
 But actually the English language,

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.720
 nicked it from Italy's Angcora

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.600
 and changed it to on court,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.040
 thinking that sounds nice in French.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.200
 But the French say B as in a second time.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.080
 Do it a second time.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.200
 Like a second time, okay.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:22.680
 Yeah.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.280
 Not like a Buzzy family.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.440
 No, like we've heard it once A.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.240
 Let's hear it B.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.840
 Oh, that would be good.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.720
 It's interesting because so modern day on court

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.160
 you don't repeat the material.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.760
 It's bits you haven't played.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.120
 So I don't know.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.520
 I once went to watch the band Junia Senior

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.120
 and they only had one song.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.480
 It was called "Move Your Feet"

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.600
 that everyone had heard of

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.960
 and they played it four times.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.680
 Did they?

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.160
 Wow.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.840
 There are occasional times of that happens.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.240
 In 1926, there was a musical called "Betsy"

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.000
 which is a Roger's and Hart musical.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.360
 But there was a song that was added to it

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.440
 the last minute which was Irving Berlin song

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.040
 and it was "Blue Skies"

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.080
 and it was so popular that at the end of the night

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.840
 they requested the song again

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.440
 and the song by Bell Baker

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.240
 but they requested it in total 24 times.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.240
 She did it on on court 24 times

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.720
 and on the final time that she was singing it

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.520
 she was so dazed from singing it she forgot the words.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.440
 And while she forgot the words,

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.440
 suddenly a voice could be heard from the front row

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.800
 which was Irving Berlin

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.800
 who was filling in for the missing lyrics

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.080
 and singing the rest of the song for.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.720
 No way.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.840
 Quite a cool opening night.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.360
 It must have been some people in the crowd

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.760
 who were saying after maybe the 20th time.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.000
 Well, we've all had a really good time.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.320
 Yeah, it's cool.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.160
 That is hell.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.520
 You've got to turn it down.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.520
 You've got to learn to say no to an encore, I think,

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.480
 in that instance.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.600
 There's just no way of voting.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.080
 There's no, if a few people really want an encore

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.120
 then you might get one.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.000
 It's hard.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.840
 Well, there used to be a thing, in fact,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.520
 where in the 19th century

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.520
 at these choral festivals that happened

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.360
 it was so irritating that, you know,

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.800
 you kept getting loads of oncours

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.480
 that the encore decision was reserved

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.160
 for a single person,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.160
 like the bishop, or the male, or whoever.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.920
 And they could decide what they wanted to hear again.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.000
 Just because you talked about the bishop.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.480
 Yeah.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.240
 Do you know that just after the marriage of Figaro started,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.280
 Beaumache got arrested and got sent to prison?

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:17.960
 And that was because there was a protest outside of the play

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.200
 which involved the Archbishop of Paris.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.160
 And he apparently assaulted the Archbishop of Paris

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.120
 and got sent to prison for bashing the bishop.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:26.840
 Shut up.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.840
 That's where we get the phrase from.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.280
 And was he assaulting him?

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.240
 But had he said, had he banned an encore or something?

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.480
 Well, the Archbishop was trying to stop people

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.840
 from going into the theatre

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.640
 because he was like, stop this filth kind of thing.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.720
 So he was like, stopping anyone from going in

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.320
 and he was like, how can you stop these ladies

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.280
 from coming in? You shouldn't.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.520
 And he kind of bashed him out of the way.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.560
 And then he got arrested.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.160
 It's freezing for a bruising.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.480
 Dashing for a bashing.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.080
 He was dashing for a bashing.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.760
 Anyway, Andy's novel is available.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.680
 Oh, goodbye, Scott.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.680
 It's a dark star in the night.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.480
 It's a combination of Dr. Seuss and the Pirates of Pensans.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:13.160
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.080
 And that is James.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.320
 OK, my fact this week is that humans

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.200
 have transported European earthworms

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.200
 to every continent on the planet except Antarctica.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.360
 In a process, some worm experts are calling global warming.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.680
 It's really good.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.840
 Delivered that like as a Fox News headly, really?

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.760
 Well, this was an amazing article

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.320
 that I read in the Atlantic by Julia Rosen.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.400
 And it's all about earthworms.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.000
 And the fact that mainly if you go to North America,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.640
 they had a big glacial ice sheet over there

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.240
 about 10,000 years ago.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.240
 And it killed off all of the worms.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.920
 And so you would think there'd be no worms there,

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.520
 but actually there are worms there.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.520
 And that's because humans have brought them over.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.760
 And this is actually bad news for the environment

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.360
 because worms are pretty good for the environment in some ways.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.760
 But if you put them in a place where they're not supposed to be,

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.320
 then like all animals, that's not a good thing.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.080
 I like the tone in which it's--

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.960
 Here's Tom with the weather.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.760
 No, but it is surprising.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.280
 Because I would have thought that I thought

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.960
 before researching this fact that worms were good

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.800
 pretty much wherever you had them.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.080
 Because they--

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.200
 What are they doing in the UK?

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.440
 They make your soil better.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.240
 Yeah.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.600
 And they make channels in it.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.520
 Some people say it's a bit of a myth, actually.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.800
 And a worm is a symptom rather than a cause of good soil.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.480
 So they go to good soil?

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.280
 Is the idea?

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.480
 That's an idea.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.080
 Right, that's interesting.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.800
 It's a controversial issue.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.920
 I don't want to get into it right now.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.040
 But that's what some people say.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.960
 But basically where they shouldn't be,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.200
 they are-- the soil in the boreal forest

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.680
 in the northern half of the planet.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.400
 It's the largest carbon sink at the bottom.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.120
 It has 200 billion metric tons of carbon

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.320
 in this boreal forest.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.520
 And that's not just in the trees.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.400
 I didn't realize that either.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.760
 Loads of it is actually in the soil.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.480
 But under a tree, you might get twice as much

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.720
 carbon in the soil as there is in the tree itself.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.000
 Which I had no idea about.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.560
 And so the worms, sometimes, they eat the top layer

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.600
 of the soil, basically.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.680
 And they just make it thinner and thinner and thinner.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.080
 And then all the carbon is actually being released at the air

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.240
 because the worms are eating it up and creating channels.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.840
 Although there is another argument

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.680
 that when they're making their casts,

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.880
 which is when you're eating soil,

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.680
 you kind of give out some soil poo stuff

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.120
 that that actually keeps in loads more carbon.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.960
 So really, actually, these days,

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.960
 no one has really looked into earthworms enough

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.120
 to know exactly what they're doing to the environment.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.360
 I didn't realize they were such a hot bed of debate.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.160
 Yeah.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.000
 We don't see enough of this on earth to be.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.200
 Yeah.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.400
 Just wait till next week.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.560
 Piersmog and they'll be whining all about earthworms.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.920
 But they eat seeds.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.640
 They eat seeds, which you'd think would be fine

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.600
 because it's just their diet.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.120
 But in the bits of America,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.000
 north of the Mason-Dixon line and east of the Great Plains,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.440
 where they used to not exist,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.200
 there used to be millipedes and mites everywhere.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.080
 And that's just worms.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.560
 Yeah.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.240
 So they're hugely invasive.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.360
 And so for sure, it's quite bad for them to be up there.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.480
 Because like, for instance,

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.120
 you've got all this bits of leaves and stuff on the floor

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.720
 and all the millipedes live under there,

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.000
 nice and happy.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.840
 And then suddenly the worms come along

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.240
 and they just eat all of the leaves and stuff like that.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.800
 And there's nowhere for the millipedes to live and they all die.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.200
 And someone said in this ass-close reading,

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.280
 I think it was in this Atlantic article

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.840
 that it's like going to the African-Sovanna,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.240
 taking out all the animals and just replacing them all

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.440
 with elephants.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.440
 And just tons of elephants everywhere.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.240
 Yeah.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.520
 And one of the problems seems to be that we know very little about them

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.320
 to some extent.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.160
 So it was only in 2008 that we discovered the common earthworm,

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.880
 which was thought to be one species, it was actually five.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.080
 Wow.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.120
 So that one common earthworm is different from another

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.280
 as a human from an ape.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.800
 And in the US, I like this quote.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.280
 In the US, I was reading a one article, a quote,

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.280
 which said, "Shocking me little is known about

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.960
 any of our native earthworms.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.080
 There is only one working earthworm taxonomist

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.000
 in all of America."

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.800
 So I looked into this because I wanted to find out who it was.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.000
 That's an easy job, isn't it?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.200
 Of all taxonomy, oh, taxonomy, I thought it was taxidermy.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.520
 Worm taxidermy is very easy.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.400
 Yeah.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.280
 You're right.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.280
 You just cut off the end and go, just blow out the middle.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.280
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.040
 So I tried to find out about who the taxonomist is.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.320
 And anyway, it came, of course, this 1995 book.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.720
 And I was just so impressed at the level of research.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.320
 So it was about worms.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.480
 And it says, there's one trained professional worm

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.960
 taxonomist in America.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.840
 And then it says, there is sort of a second,

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.800
 but she's only recently trained, so not good enough.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.160
 And then says, OK, there's a third expert.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.440
 He was trained by his mother.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.040
 And he actually works in a post office.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.520
 And then it was like, he said, "The fourth and last person

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.600
 in North America who has any knowledge of earthworm taxonomy

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.600
 works as a police lawyer in New Brunswick, Canada."

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.600
 Wow.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.920
 This guy has actually been around every single person

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.320
 in America to find out if they know about earthworms.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.520
 That's really impressive.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.920
 So impressive.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.400
 Yeah.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.200
 You can get three meter long worms.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.040
 That's long.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.440
 Yeah, this is the Australian giant Jipsland earthworm.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.640
 Up to three meters long.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:20.200
 And apparently, they used to be very abundant in the 1800s.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.920
 And if you plowed your fields, they'd

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.200
 be red with blood from all these worms that you'd plowed up.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.360
 That's long.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.920
 It's pretty messed up, yeah.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.840
 They would hang from the plow's like spaghetti,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.320
 someone described it as.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:31.840
 Wow.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.080
 And but they're quite cool.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:33.920
 So you can hear them.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.760
 They're so big and they're so vocal that when you're

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.160
 walking in the territory in the Jipsland area,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.200
 in the territory where they live.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.440
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, you're walking on the--

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.280
 Ow.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.120
 Is that what you say vocal, is that what you mean?

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.440
 That's sort of what I mean.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.720
 But if you walk on the ground, you can hear them squelching

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.120
 and squirming underfoot because they're very fast.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.720
 And so they squirm away.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.080
 And so if you walk, you'll hear a gurgling squelching sound.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.880
 It's like they're moving through their burrows, I think,

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.200
 because it's like the water draining in a bath.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.000
 They move through the--

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.800
 yeah, their bodies are slimy against the walls of their burrow.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.640
 Oh, wow.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.480
 They're a foot long when they're born.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.160
 When they're born?

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.360
 Yeah, they're really big.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.120
 Are they born in eggs?

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.880
 So they're in like a cocoon type thing.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.360
 I don't know if they're eggs or born live.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.240
 But they do-- so they have no teeth.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.120
 But they do have a gizzard.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.720
 Well, you know they're like a chicken.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.560
 Like a chicken, yeah.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.240
 At least swallow little rocks.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.920
 And they use those to grind up their food inside them.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.480
 Do you know how you collect worms?

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.320
 Because there's a worm conservation effort going on now

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.720
 in the worms are good for the environment lobby.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.840
 So I think you tap the ground and they think there's a bird there.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.160
 No, they think there's rain there.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.680
 And they come up thinking there's rain.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.200
 And then you just plop them out.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.520
 You do do a bit of that.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.800
 And we have mentioned the worm tapping before.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.720
 I was actually talking about the more brutal way,

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.760
 which is you just shove a spade in the ass, which

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.760
 is what people used to do.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.240
 And they're doing much less now.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.600
 But it turns out you're just cutting them in half all the time.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.520
 And that does cause a bit of an issue.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.600
 Because if you're trying to get rid of them,

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.640
 you're just doubling the population.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.640
 Exactly.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.240
 It gets out of control.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.760
 No, so what they do to avoid using the shovel now

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.280
 is they take DNA swabs.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.320
 Because it's all about counting the population

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.800
 of a certain species.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.560
 And so you swab the mucus from their passages.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.320
 So they make these tiny channels.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.880
 And scientists who are looking into earth

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.120
 and populations will just swab a worm tunnel.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.840
 And they scrape their saliva off it.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.240
 And then they measure it in a test tube.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.040
 When you said swapping their passages,

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.080
 I thought it was like inside the body passages.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.280
 It's not a small swab, isn't it?

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:36.760
 So I was thinking, worm goes, I've got my GP check up again.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.560
 Worms, be a test.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.920
 There's only one stair up.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.960
 And the doctor uses a cocktail stick.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.960
 Yeah.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.120
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.320
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.520
 And that is my fact.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.560
 My fact this week is that the most popular street in America

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.040
 is second street.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.360
 The second most popular street is third street.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.440
 And the third most popular street is first street.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.680
 So--

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.480
 And who's on first?

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.880
 Yeah, so fourth is fourth, fifth is park,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.280
 and sixth is fifth, just to bring you further down the list.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.600
 Is there not Main Street here in any way?

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.920
 So there is.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.840
 This is from 1993.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.800
 This was the Census Bureau in America released this report.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.680
 In recent years, I think it was in the 2013 sort of period.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.200
 They released all new information about the general information

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.200
 about geography, topography, and so on.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.000
 But they didn't do the same list that they've done before.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.720
 And few people have gone through it completely

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.680
 and they've compiled lists.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.800
 But none of them seemed to tally with the others.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.640
 So Washington posted one where they said that park

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.360
 was the number one street.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.720
 But then someone on Reddit called Darren Hawley.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.120
 He did one that said Main Street was the top one.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.000
 And so they think the reason first is not up there

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.080
 is because first and main were two versions of saying first,

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.040
 basically.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.840
 So it knocked it down.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.920
 It halved its chances.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.320
 Also, the idea is that if you have a first street,

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.320
 which is your main street in your town,

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.320
 you might name it after George Washington,

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.320
 or Abraham Lincoln, or Donald Trump, or something like that.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.080
 Yeah.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.600
 Did you know that Ludford in Lincolnshire

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.400
 has a street named after Donald Trump?

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.800
 Well, I say it's named after Donald Trump.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.840
 It's called Fanny Hands Lane.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.840
 Oh, my God.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.880
 Sorry.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.800
 Cheap, cheap, and unfair.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.400
 But actually, there's nothing rude about it.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.240
 Nothing rude about Fanny Hands Lane.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.080
 Yes, there is.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.080
 The word Fanny.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.560
 It has been claimed that it's affecting property prices

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.240
 that are having a street called Fanny Hands Lane.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.800
 But the thing is, it was just named in the 19th century

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.040
 by a man named John Hans after his wife Fanny.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.880
 No, there's nothing rude about it.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:45.600
 Do you know in London, just down the road from here,

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.840
 there's a place called Knight Rider Street.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.800
 Oh, no.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.680
 Very cool.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.720
 And do you know who it's named after?

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.920
 Hasselhoff, I would say.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.760
 Well, the car.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.520
 No, obviously not.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.920
 No, it was because it was the route that Knight used to take

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.000
 from the Tower of London to Smithfield where

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.320
 Jowse were held.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.520
 So Knight's would ride across that street.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.520
 And they're talking carriages, wouldn't they?

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.520
 Yes.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:15.360
 I was reading about Nicaragua's capital city of Managua.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.960
 So I was trying to find out based on this fact

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.800
 about street names.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:19.960
 I was trying to find out if there was anywhere

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.560
 where the streets have no name, like in the salt.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.560
 Yeah.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.600
 Because Bono wrote that while on a visit to Ethiopia

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.680
 and it's thought that it was about the poverty there

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.200
 and that it didn't have proper street naming system.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.440
 So in Managua, in Nicaragua, it did have a modern grid system

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.640
 until 1972.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.400
 And then there was an earthquake which destroyed lots

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.240
 of buildings and infrastructure.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.040
 And basically, they've replaced the system

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.400
 with a really ramshackle one.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.600
 So you might be directed to somewhere

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.960
 which is a block south of the Convent and half a block east

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.240
 of the College.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.600
 And you just have to get there.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.600
 And so taxi drivers there are amazingly good

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.400
 because they know all these places.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.720
 And sometimes you'll ask for directions

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.720
 and you'll be told, oh yeah, go to the Blue House

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.520
 which is actually brown.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.920
 That's because locals know that there is a house

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.720
 which is brown, but it used to be blue.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.240
 Wow.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:06.720
 That's so good.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.000
 I know.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.800
 So Kaby's there at like next level.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.120
 Or you might be told to go down and that means go west

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.440
 because the sun goes down in the west.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.240
 Oh, that's good.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.520
 It's-- I don't know how any stuff gets delivered properly.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.960
 Also very difficult if you've got one

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.760
 of those travelling shops who were talking about it.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.760
 Yeah.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.840
 But it does talk about this kind of thing.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.240
 It makes you really respect America

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.960
 for having just gone down the line.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.680
 Grid system, you know, this is the number of the street.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.880
 This is the number of the avenue.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.760
 It's very boring.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.080
 It's very effective.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.880
 And so that was come up with by Penn, after him, Pennsylvania

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.400
 named.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.680
 Not from Penn and Teller.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.760
 Just magic streets into existence.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.880
 So William Penn, he came up with the grid system in 1682

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.600
 when he founded Philadelphia, which was only founded

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.800
 because basically the King of England, King Charles II,

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.640
 was massively in debt to him and had no money to pay him.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.120
 So instead said, have this random tract of land

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.440
 in Philadelphia.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.960
 And so he gave him this land.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.080
 And so Penn, famous Quaker, said of this utopian,

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.240
 where he wanted to be a utopian society.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.960
 But he really didn't want it to be called Pennsylvania.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.800
 And also Pennsylvania is not named after him.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.320
 It's named after his dad.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.960
 Yeah, who happens to have the same name?

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.880
 He was very clear.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.160
 I don't want to think I'm a cocky twat.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.840
 He wanted to call it New Wales, because it reminded him

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.520
 so much of Wales, which was very fond.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.960
 Anyway, so he really didn't want it to be called named after him.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:36.080
 And now Pennsylvania forever bears his name, which is very sad.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.160
 That's cool.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.080
 And they're quite good at coming up

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.880
 with funny names in America, aren't they?

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.040
 Of the streets.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.840
 I know they do have lots of firsts and seconds,

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.280
 but there's a few funny ones.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.120
 Shall we mention them before?

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.040
 I did say once that the number 69 road marker's always

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.040
 gets stolen, don't we?

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:51.560
 Yes.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.400
 Didn't we?

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.200
 And there's a stoner drive in Colesville and a blunt road.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.800
 And they have had people stealing their road signs all the time.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.120
 But they've come up with a way of stopping that.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.120
 And that is they're making them without any vowels.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.160
 So what used to say stoner drive now says,

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.120
 ST, blank N, blank R, drive.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.240
 And what used to be blunt road is now BLNT road.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.680
 Do they leave the space?

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.520
 They leave the space.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.360
 This is the space.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:20.880
 Oh, wow.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.280
 Because that just looks like it was made by a stoner.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.320
 Yes.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.280
 It just couldn't be bothered finishing it.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.560
 Unfortunately, they've all been stolen by fans of only connects.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.320
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.080
 And that is Andy.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.960
 My fact is that the game of Scrabble

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.360
 is partly thanks to Edgar Allan Poe.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.360
 Oh, spooky.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:51.480
 And that's why spooky with 20 O's is actually accepted in Scrabble, isn't it?

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.000
 So this is about the man who invented Scrabble.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.520
 His name was Alfred Mosher buts.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.800
 And he--

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.920
 He sounds like a good time, doesn't he?

00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.440
 Yeah.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.840
 He's a good time guy.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.560
 Yeah, that's Mosher buts.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.480
 He was an unemployed architect.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.120
 He was a sack architect in Depression era America,

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.400
 so early '30s.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.960
 And he was trying to work out how to come up with a ball game

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.800
 because he thought this could be worthwhile.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.680
 He thought there aren't many wordy board games at the time,

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.400
 which there weren't.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.440
 I think he was playing.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.160
 Was he playing trivial pursuit or something?

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.120
 He was playing some game that he absolutely hated

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.160
 and there must be something better than this.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.520
 Yeah, exactly.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.160
 And he was inspired by Manopoli as well, I think.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.120
 And so he-- but he was trying to work out how to come up

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.120
 with a word game because he thought this might be something.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:38.200
 And he had read, as a child, the Edgar Allan Poe story,

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.240
 the Gold Bug, and there's a code in that, which

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.320
 has to be broken.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.480
 And the way to break the code is that it's

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.600
 based on how frequently particular letters

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.480
 appear in the English language.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.840
 So the one that appears most is E and so on.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.840
 And so--

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.840
 And you know the rest, yeah.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.720
 And so he decided to make that the system by which letters

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.320
 would score more or less in scramble.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.720
 And he studied newspaper front pages for ages.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.240
 And you can see there are photos online of his tally charts

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.760
 where he's methodically counting each letter,

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.080
 how often it appears on the front page of the New York Times,

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.880
 say, very dedicated.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.280
 Yeah, and that's what came up with the scoring system.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.240
 That's cool.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.920
 He didn't really like playing his game too much by the end

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.800
 because his wife always beat him, Mrs. Butts.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:33.200
 She once scoured 234 for Quixotic against him, yeah.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.080
 Apparently.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.360
 This-- he sounds like a sore loser,

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.040
 because I'd assumed it was only because he was losing it

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.160
 trivial pursuit that he invented scrabble and twisted it.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.520
 I've got to invent some game.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.360
 OK, here's a game.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.560
 Whoever has a stupid name wins.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.960
 They've still a log comes funny hands off the fuck's sake.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.720
 They've still got the scorecard.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.680
 The nephew-- there was a journalist who fell madly in love

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.760
 with the history of Scrabble.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.720
 And he'd track down the nephew who has no interest in playing it

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.520
 but has an obsession with collecting all the things

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.520
 that let's--

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.200
 Well, so I track down Mocha Butts as an nephew, right?

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.680
 And in his house-- so he has everything framed.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.040
 But most of it is not up on the walls.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.800
 It's still in the sort of brown packaging

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.800
 that the frame has handed it over in.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.720
 And one of those is the scorecard.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:20.000
 So Mrs. Butts kept the scorecard from her Quixotic score.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.520
 I think you were.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.000
 There were more problems in the marriage, weren't there?

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.400
 If you're framing your victories over your husband--

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.400
 Well, no, actually, James is right.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.480
 If you'd scored Quixotic-- and supposedly,

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.960
 it was across two triple word scores.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.600
 I mean, it sounds like an absolute--

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.640
 Sorry, checks out.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.640
 Yeah.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.360
 Set up.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.720
 Do you know who is the best Scrabble players in the world,

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.200
 which country?

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:44.720
 America.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.880
 Yes, I know.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.680
 France?

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.200
 No.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.280
 Well, I'm going to say from an old episode,

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.040
 I think it's a guy from New Zealand.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.040
 Ah, yes, because he managed to win the French one,

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.000
 didn't he, despite not being able to speak French?

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.680
 Yes.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.960
 But no, it is Nigeria.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.080
 OK, and the Nigerian Scrabble Federation,

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.800
 because this year said that they really

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.000
 need to be given more money from the government,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.840
 because according to them, it's the only spot

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.240
 that they're the world's best at in the world

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.240
 in this Scrabble.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.320
 Oh.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.720
 Can I just quickly-- because we spoke about Nigel Richards

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.880
 in episode 79.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.960
 Long time ago, this is the guy who won the French Scrabble thing.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.440
 I just wanted to check on an update on him,

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.600
 see how he's doing in his championships.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.920
 He is still the winner of the French Scrabble Championships.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.000
 He won 2017, 2018, and 2019.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.320
 In their elite competitions.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.960
 So he's still just owning it.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.360
 Yeah, how-- really how many people are competing?

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.720
 It's a biggie, I think.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.640
 Is it, though?

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.480
 It's Scrabble, isn't it?

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.920
 Let's face it.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.560
 Do you know who our Scrabble champion is?

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.240
 No, look.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:44.960
 He's a great guy.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.440
 He's called Alan Simmons.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.840
 And he is banned from playing Scrabble as of 2017,

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.560
 because he cheated by peaking at the letters

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.760
 who are picking out the bag and then putting that back in

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.560
 and swapping them for other letters.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.680
 That is Scrabble Champion of the UK.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.480
 Wow.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.760
 But that's a thing.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.720
 There's a rule where I think maybe--

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.280
 who knows if it's thanks to Simmons or not,

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.120
 but there's a rule where you have to take the letters out

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.160
 of the bag at eye height or higher.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.160
 Really?

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.200
 He was done for holding the bag too low.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.560
 That's great.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.360
 And there's a thing called Brailing.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.160
 Have you heard this?

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:16.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:21.160
 Brailing is feeling letters as you're holding them in the bag

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.000
 and trying to work out what they are.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:23.520
 Yeah.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.560
 That makes sense, right?

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.640
 Because a blank would just be a flat surface.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.240
 Yeah, that's true.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.440
 But I mean, I'm not very-- I can imagine taking a long time

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.640
 to work out, oh, it's an E or whatever.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.520
 Like, it's quite impressive that you get a--

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.720
 Yeah, it's not just blanks and non-blanks.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.160
 OK, they're more sophisticated than that.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.080
 I mean, you could say that, huh?

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.120
 It's no blank, yeah.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.200
 I think if you're taking out three or four Scrabble tiles

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.040
 each time and you pick four, quickly feel them.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.920
 And if there's no blank, you pick another four.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.080
 That's going to over-long run.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.200
 That's going to make a difference.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:51.720
 Yeah.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.800
 Yeah, your mind averages, yeah.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.080
 But I do think that if you are fumbling around

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.360
 for what shapes the indentations and Scrabble tiles,

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.280
 you just need to reflect on your life.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.760
 Just with your hand in the bag, you need to think,

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.840
 what the fuck am I doing?

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.840
 Winning.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.360
 Winning.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.040
 Winning.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.960
 One thing that was a new exciting moment in Scrabble

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.600
 is that last year, OK, was added.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.720
 And apparently, this was very controversial.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.720
 Yeah.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.080
 OK, you agree.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:17.840
 I do, actually.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.760
 Do you why?

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.720
 Because isn't one of the things about Scrabble

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.560
 that you're not allowed acronyms?

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.400
 OK, oh my god, Andy, I can't believe you're

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.640
 on this side of the argument.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.720
 OK, has not been an elitonism for like a hundred years.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.080
 What's it's down for?

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.000
 Oh, well, there we come, the commentary.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.320
 But that's the theory that it stands for all correct.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.920
 But all with ORL.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.120
 And that's correct with OK.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.120
 Yeah, that's correct.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.120
 OK.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.120
 It does stand for that.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.720
 That is genuinely the first instance of OK,

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.760
 is the all correct thing.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.920
 But there is another theory that it stands for Happy Birthday,

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.280
 but Happy is Spelt with a No.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.680
 And Birthday is Spelt with a OK.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.040
 OK, two, you, yeah.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.640
 But when I say OK, I am putting a full stop

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.440
 after the O, another one after the K,

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.320
 and therefore no one should be allowed to play in Scrabble.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.640
 Do you know what you should start doing, then?

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.600
 You should start saying OWL, which was another thing

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.560
 that this magazine tried to get going at the time,

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.000
 when OK took off.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.040
 So OWL was for all right.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.560
 And so it thought that OWL was going to become a thing as well.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:18.360
 Would you spell that?

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.480
 What letters are you putting in the start of OWL?

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.800
 It's OWL.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.760
 It's all misspelled.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.920
 It's part of the satire, guys.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.760
 Comedy was different.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.120
 I know it starts, but I'm going to start saying OWL,

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.400
 and I mean OK.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.200
 People will constantly be asking me if I'm all right.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:33.920
 Are you OK?

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.080
 OWL.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:35.600
 All right.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.280
 Yes, that's what it stands for.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:38.800
 Crazy.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.640
 Have you had a coffee housing?

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.640
 No.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.160
 There's another practice in Scrabble.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.680
 It's not a frowned upon practice in Scrabble.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.640
 Can you guess what it is?

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.480
 Coffee housing.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.880
 Is it when you shove the tiles up your ass?

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.640
 Like, we all do it a coffee house.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.520
 But where's your connection to that?

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.440
 It's frowned upon.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.280
 I was just thinking, you saw that you might do a Scrabble

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.280
 that's frowned upon.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.440
 Yeah, but it's true.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:02.000
 Is it, you can feel that on the tiles in the bag, aren't you?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.800
 Yeah, you can.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.520
 These have been in an ass.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.920
 If I go to a coffee house, I give them my name

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.840
 and they spell it incorrectly every time.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.320
 So is it putting down a word which is correctly spelled,

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.080
 incorrectly spelled and saying it's correct?

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:13.880
 That's a rip.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.920
 That's actually so good.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.200
 Better than what it is.

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.880
 That's a lovely explanation.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.280
 Coffee housing is just distracting your opponents

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.960
 with chat about their day or anything else.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.560
 Put any foot up your ass recently.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.600
 That's quite good.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.600
 That's a good idea.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.840
 That's amazing.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.680
 This podcast is all coffee housing.

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.000
 No Scrabble, isn't it?

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.960
 It's like a game of Scrabble where the coffee housing

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.800
 got out of hand.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.480
 There's a blog which I really like called "Taiwiki with me."

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.440
 And the person who runs it is called "Minister to Stan."

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.080
 And they play a game of Scrabble, which I think is really good.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.440
 They do a few different things.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.880
 First of all, double bagging.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.680
 Brand upon.

00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.800
 Well, you keep all your consonants in one bag

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.360
 and all your vowels in another bag.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.400
 And so you can pick the ones that you want depending

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.880
 on what you've got on your rack.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.080
 Oh, like countdown.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:05.880
 Yeah.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.000
 That's a good idea, right?

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.080
 And they have another one which is open booking, which

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.960
 means you're allowed to have the dictionary open and check

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.760
 things as you go along.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.360
 And they also spin their racks around

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.600
 to ask the other person for help if you get stuck.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.080
 And they play the game where the two people

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.800
 playing got a combined amount of 2,000 points.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.800
 That's so good.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.240
 I just think it's a more friendly game.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:27.760
 It is.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.080
 It's more coffee-housey.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.080
 Yeah.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:30.760
 That is good.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.800
 I think I would play Scrabble more if I was allowed to do those things.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.120
 Oh, no one let you play Scrabble with them anyway.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.200
 It's cool, didn't they?

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:37.880
 I don't know what that means.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.840
 It's not a cool sport.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.360
 Yeah.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.840
 It's not like it's different.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.240
 I don't know if it's a Scrabble class.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.280
 It's so cool, Alan.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.280
 It's cool.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.280
 That's really very nice.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.080
 It's a playscrabble with me.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.160
 That was my dream.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.360
 Go learn to the Scrabble team.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.400
 I have a few things on Po.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.400
 Oh, let's go do it.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:54.960
 Should we go Po?

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:55.480
 Ow.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:00.080
 All right.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:00.880
 Wow.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.800
 This is going to get incredibly annoying very fast, isn't it?

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.800
 So the Gold Bug, which was the initial short story that was written,

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.600
 that inspired butts.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.440
 So Po had-- basically what it was was that was a code that he'd worked out.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:20.000
 And he, the same method, kind of looked through bunches of books and papers to see what

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.520
 a recurring letter was to give them this form.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:27.560
 And he was quite a big code setter back in the day for the newspapers he worked for.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.880
 He used to do a thing of setting out a challenge of saying to the readers, send me a code, anything

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.560
 cryptic, and I will solve it.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.680
 And he would publish his findings.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.560
 He'd publish the solutions in the next week's paper.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.560
 Yeah.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.560
 It's a lovely idea.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.760
 And he used to set them as well and give them out to the readers.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.280
 And he was shocked when even one person was able to crack them, because he thought he was

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.640
 so good at setting these codes aside of him.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.640
 I had no idea about that.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.640
 Yeah.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.360
 He had the bit of the moat sets about him, didn't he?

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.880
 When he published a raven, it was basically an overnight success.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.720
 Everyone thought it was amazing, turned him into a celebrity, and everyone said how brilliant

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:02.720
 it was.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.520
 And he told a friend it was the greatest poem that was ever written.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:07.520
 Yeah.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.520
 Wow.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:13.160
 There were loads of weird parodies of the raven, though, which came up straight away.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.080
 So as soon as he published the raven, he became super famous.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.080
 It became super famous.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:22.320
 But also published work, The Gazelle, The Whipple Wheel, The Turkey, The Polcat.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.320
 And Lincoln actually, President Lincoln, read and enjoyed the Polcat, the pern, the Polcat

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:30.000
 before he read the raven, which was a piss take of the raven.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.360
 There's a few people that believe that the raven was not originally going to be a raven,

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.160
 that it was going to be a parrot.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.160
 Well, because it can talk.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.160
 Yeah, exactly.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.480
 It was a dark and stormy night.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:48.680
 Yeah, Poe wrote a philosophy of composition, a piece, and in it, he said, arose the idea of

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:53.240
 a non-reasoning creature capable of speech and very naturally a parrot in the first instance

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.800
 suggested itself.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:59.280
 And then he later on says, but then it's superseded with the raven along the lines, but we might've

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.280
 had, yeah, a parrot.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.840
 It just definitely does another same kind of marketing, spooky vibe, does it?

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.840
 No, no, no.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.840
 There's one theory.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:11.440
 I think this might be true, actually, that the raven that he writes about was Charles Dickens'

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.440
 raven.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.440
 Is that right?

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.320
 So Charles Dickens had a raven called Grip, the Knowing.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.320
 And he was a character in Barnaby Rudge.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:24.640
 And when Edgar Allan Poe reviewed Barnaby Rudge, he thought that this raven was an amazing

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.640
 part of it.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:29.200
 And the theory is that the raven in his poem was from that, and that's why he changed it

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.200
 from a parrot.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.200
 Wow.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.200
 So he cast the raven from someone else's boi.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.200
 Incredible.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.200
 That's awesome.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.160
 I love Winston Smith in 1984, I'm going to bring him into my book and use him.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.160
 But it's not like that.

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.360
 It's the raven from Barnaby.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.160
 What a weird review that must have been.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.840
 Poe, did you read any of the rest of it?

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:49.680
 It's like reviewing Harry Potter and just talking about headwig the entire time.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.880
 That's incredible.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.880
 Yeah.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.160
 I mean, his reviews were a bit weird, though, aren't they?

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.600
 He liked to slag people off quite a lot in his reviews.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:04.600
 He reviewed a collection of poems by William W. Lord in 1845, saying, "The only remarkable

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:10.560
 things about Mr. Lord's compositions are their remarkable conceit, ignorance, impudence,

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.840
 platitudes, stupidity and bombast."

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.840
 Wow.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.560
 But he only read the bit about the sparrow at the start.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.000
 He had his struggles in life.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.440
 He died aged 40 of drink, really, drink and poverty.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.040
 He was incredibly broke.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.480
 Well, his death was quite spooky in itself, wasn't it?

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.480
 Yeah.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.320
 He was found in the street, wasn't he, and clothes that didn't quite fit him, and he was

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:39.160
 taken to hospital, and he was raving with tough times for Poe.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.480
 A lot of people thought when he was found, he was drunk, and maybe he'd been on a drinking

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.480
 binge.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.480
 But then his family and friends said, "Well, it's pretty unlikely because he couldn't

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.480
 really drink.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.160
 If you gave him one glass of wine, he'd go tantos, so it didn't seem likely that he'd

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.160
 been on some binge."

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.160
 Yeah.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.600
 I think it's really even more controversial than that, really.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.720
 So he was found in someone else's clothes, didn't even fit him.

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:04.160
 And people think he was cooped, which is there was an election on the day that he was found

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.160
 dead.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:08.600
 And so some people think that he was cooped as in, this was a weird thing that was practiced

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.840
 where people who were campaigning for a certain politician would literally coop people up, would

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.240
 drug them, would force feed them, loads and loads of alcohol, and would drag them from one

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.080
 polling booth to the next, force them to vote, and then leave them abandoned, and they'd

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.880
 change their clothes as they went, so they looked like they were a different person.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:31.200
 So his reputation as being an alcoholic and a bit of a disaster, walking disaster is mostly

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.200
 undeserved.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:36.480
 It's this weird myth that came about as soon as he died, and it was spread by this guy

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:42.760
 called the Reverend Rufus Wilmot Grizzled, and it only happened because so he reviewed,

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:47.160
 so po-reviewed one of Grizzled's poems, very badly a few years earlier, and then po-sighted

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:52.120
 having an affair with this lady that Grizzled fancied, and then po-died.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:58.060
 And for some reason that no one knows, Poe's aunt made Grizzled the executor of his will,

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:01.800
 and made him the executor of all his papers, and so he was in charge of his papers, and he

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:06.320
 forged a bunch of shit, and he wrote this biography of Poe, which slandered him, and basically

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:11.640
 he said he was this opium addicted, crazy drunken, poverty-stricken, he deserted the army, expelled

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.720
 from university, none of this stuff was true.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:19.160
 He wrote his obituary as well, he had the line, "Will start or many, but few will be grieved

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:24.360
 by it, talking of his death." It's just a full-on guy.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:31.400
 The Baltimore Ravens are an American football team, and their name comes after the Raven novel,

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.880
 because Poe lived in Baltimore.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.880
 Departum?

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:39.120
 Oh god, it's a sharp poem, it's a long novel, I don't know what it is.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:43.840
 A novel to James, well this is more than two pages, I mean novel.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:47.880
 And so they get their name from the poem, the Raven, the Baltimore Ravens, because Poe lived

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:53.320
 in Baltimore, and in 2001 they won the Super Bowl, we just had the Super Bowl last night

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:58.400
 as we record this, and in 2001 the Baltimore Ravens won the Super Bowl, and they won it because

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:04.000
 they had a great defense, and ESPN said, "Quoth the Ravens, never score."

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 Oh, nice.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 Very strong.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 Yeah.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 Well, it will be by the time I've edited it.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.400
 Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.520

 retailer, and get Andy's new novel.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.720
 It's fantastic.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.160
 Maybe try the audiobook as well, if you like Irish pirate noise coming at you.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.160
 Okay, that's it.
