00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
 Hi everyone, just before we start this episode,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.080
 wanted to drop in that it's our 100th birthday.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.280
 We have been going for 100 years.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.560
 Time has flown.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.480
 No, it's our 100th episode.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.320
 And so happy birthday to us.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.360
 Thanks so much for sticking with us for our 100 full episodes.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.000
 And this is just the 100th.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.960
 Where's that 100 to many times?

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.000
 There's no big deals, just a 100.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.280
 Just a 100. Just a 100.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.480
 100. For all the show.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:32.480
 [MUSIC]

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.720
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.560
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.600
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.120
 I'm sitting here with Andy Murray,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.400
 Ange Zinski, James Harkin, and a special guest

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.480
 making his second appearance as first being as a secret track on our vinyl.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.240
 It's Stone Sour and Slipknot's frontman Corey Taylor.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.400
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.040
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.400
 Starting with you, Corey.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.360
 Oh, the honors, yes.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.840
 My fact is a million seconds is 11.5 days.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.680
 A billion seconds is 32 years.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.880
 So that is bizarre because just basically because of the vast difference,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.360
 you think that a billion is a bit more than a million.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.040
 And when we talk about billions and trillions,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.760
 when you hear about trillion dollar debt or billion dollar debt,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.160
 you kind of think they're essentially the same thing.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.600
 And yeah.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.320
 I know. I know. So I only just found out there's no zillion.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.160
 I thought that was a thing.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.400
 I know it's a billion, billion, zillion.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.360
 Not a thing at all.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.800
 It jumps to, I think there's one in between,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.000
 but there's a Google and then there's a Google Place, is that right?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.360
 That's a massive, yeah.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.960
 Which are quite large.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.520
 So a Google is one with a hundred zeros and a Googleplex is one with a Google zeros.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.720
 Because you can't write out a Googleplex because if there are more zeros,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.800
 then there are atoms in the universe.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.320
 I think so, yeah. That's the problem.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.760
 That's the problem for me.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.840
 Otherwise, we'd all be doing it.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.440
 That's why we let the computers do it.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.440
 But so it wasn't at the case that billion in America used to be a different billion, too.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.480
 No, we've half copied America, but half not copied it.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.960
 So a billion means two different things now.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.280
 So a billion in America is a thousand million.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.760
 And in the UK, it's generally a thousand million now,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.760
 but also sometimes it's a million million.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.040
 Since 1974, they officially have the standard

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.680
 where we have the American shot billion now.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.120
 I can only apologize.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.080
 Sorry.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.720
 But it's a lot easier for us all to become billionaires.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.000
 Well, I guess so.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.520
 Yeah, that's why we all are.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.800
 Why are they only billionaires sitting at the street?

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.120
 You know how long ago it was a trillion years ago?

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.080
 A trillion years ago.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.920
 I know exactly how long ago it was a trillion years ago.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.880
 In seconds, please.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.160
 No, do you know how many a trillion seconds ago?

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.200
 How many years ago that was?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.680
 It's always that a thousand billion.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.160
 Yes.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.720
 Okay.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.000
 So it's 31,710 years ago.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.680
 And that was about the first time humans started eating porridge.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.360
 Really?

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.760
 Yeah.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.480
 Oh, it's good.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.360
 What a big day.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.600
 I wonder what they ate up until that point.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.720
 Yeah, breakfast, nothing.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.520
 Breakfast, nothing.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.480
 Breakfast, porridge.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.560
 Yes, it's still eating it.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.040
 Yeah.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.320
 I mean, I'm a billionaire.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.080
 I ate meat, carbs, right off the animal.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.280
 That's probably what they were having before they were having porridge.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.920
 Breakfast.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.800
 Yeah, well, I'm saying, you know, we've gone, you know, I've gone backwards.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.760
 You know, I'm keeping it real.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.240
 Was there anything else that was going on then?

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.360
 Do you know, James?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.840
 Yeah, it was about the same time as the first

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.280
 cave paintings in Europe.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.320
 Corolla.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.400
 I believe Bruce Forsyth was also born.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.080
 Oh, yeah, I don't know.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.920
 Hey, is the one English joke ahead?

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.120
 Yeah, it's a good one, right?

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.040
 Sorry.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.720
 Strong cultural reference.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.920
 So impressive.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.640
 I know my thing.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.240
 Well, it would be the American version of that

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.760
 someone who's like really old.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.760
 Of Bruce Forsyth?

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.320
 Yeah.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.560
 Maybe, but I don't even know if he's still alive.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.040
 Bob Hope.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.000
 Bob Hope, yeah.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.280
 Oh, he did, I said.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.280
 Yeah, he made it to 100 though.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.760
 Yeah.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.960
 Although it turns out,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.320
 I was reading this thing about Bob Hope

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.600
 that he actually lied about his birthday just for a sort of like,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.960
 he just knocked it a year younger.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.200
 Well, he was only like 26.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.160
 No, no, yeah.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.320
 No, so he, I just think just for some kind of reason,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.680
 he knocked it a year back.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.160
 So secretly, he knew he'd hit 100.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.800
 Yeah.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.000
 But he couldn't tell anyone.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.400
 So then when he hit 100 officially in the country,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.280
 they're like, happy birthday,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.320
 but he would have been over it by then.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.560
 Yeah, well, he's just greedy and whatever.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.680
 He saw himself in the foot there.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.360
 He was originally named like Bob Hope.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.640
 Yeah.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.760
 And one of the great things the Buddha could do, apparently,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.120
 according to Buddhist legenders,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.400
 can't really, really high.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.520
 Really high.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.080
 He, well, super high, James, I'll tell you how high.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.440
 A mathematician asked him,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.040
 "What's the highest number you know?"

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.960
 And so the Buddha said, "Well, I know this number."

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.080
 That's a bit different.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.280
 Yeah.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.480
 He could name it though.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.080
 He's the guy who probably came up with Zillian

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.360
 in a panicked moment,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.360
 but like a Zillian, I can count out two.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.880
 Right before he said, "Good Jillian."

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.760
 Yeah.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.600
 And then the mathematician said to Buddha,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.520
 "What about Zillian and what?"

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.720
 Yeah.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.360
 Huh?

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.920
 In your face, Buddha.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.080
 And on this basis, a great religion was founded.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.920
 There was a really good article in I-09,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.200
 which I love about how we can't even comprehend

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.960
 this million billion, these massive numbers thing.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.880
 Humans haven't evolved to comprehend them.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.960
 Like, when we were, you know, 3000 years ago,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.960
 4000 years ago, we didn't need to think about anything

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.040
 except people in our immediate vicinity.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.360
 We didn't have much astronomical knowledge,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.840
 stuff like that.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.200
 So we didn't have all these big numbers.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.600
 So this article that was written by someone called,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.600
 a mathematician called Spencer Greenberg,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.840
 is talking about how you can make numbers

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.720
 be more manageable or make huge things seem more manageable.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.920
 So like, for instance, the time thing is one.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.400
 So you say you could do this over a certain amount of time.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.080
 Another one is breaking stuff down.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.080
 So if you say the US has $17 trillion of debt,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.680
 the best thing to do there is actually say

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.400
 that's $54,000 of debt per person.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.560
 See, this is the problem because you say,

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.800
 how many dollars was it for every person in America?

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.000
 54,000.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.120
 So I can't picture 300 million people,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.960
 which is about the population of the USA.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.800
 So that's where it all falls down, unfortunately.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.160
 It's a manageable amount of money for an unimaginable amount of money.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.320
 Unfortunately, a lot of Americans can handle 54,000.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.160
 In Germany, after the war,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.400
 they had very bad inflation

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.520
 and things started costing, you know, 10,000 marks.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.720
 This is after World War One.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.840
 Yeah, exactly.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.000
 And they had this mental disorder called zero stroke or cypher stroke,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.640
 where people just kept writing down zeroes all the time

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.800
 because they just couldn't deal with these massive numbers.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.680
 Really?

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.520
 And you would ask them, how many kids do you have?

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.160
 And they'd be like, I've got 10 trillion children,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.120
 or how old are you?

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.520
 Seven billion years old or something.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.360
 So interesting.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.360
 Because they just couldn't deal with these massive numbers.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.320
 Wow.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.000
 In 2009, Zimbabwe printed 100 trillion Zimbabwe and dollar notes.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.880
 I have one.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.920
 Do you?

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.440
 And it's worth like something, like 20 pounds or something.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.680
 Yeah, I think I bought mine for about five.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.720
 Nice, okay.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.760
 You've got it on the cheap.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.520
 James collects these kind of things, though,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.000
 just so he can pull things out of his wallet to impress you.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.640
 James literally has two tickets to the gun show.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.360
 Like, he literally has two tickets to the gun show.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.080
 I was in Florida and there was a gun show going on.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.160
 No, I didn't want to go to it, but I wanted the tickets.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.000
 So I just lost my ticket.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.360
 I've actually been meaning to ask since you did that,

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.000
 what a gun show is and it's gone so long that I just haven't now.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.760
 Does everyone else know what a gun show is?

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.000
 You just go along and look at guns and, um,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.440
 I think you should, and you could buy them.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.920
 It's kind of an "pagent" for guns, really.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.960
 Do you dress them up?

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.960
 Is it like Croft's for guns?

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.160
 A little more explosive, if I'm honest.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.440
 And the very thing is, I have a house in Las Vegas.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.080
 And there's kind of an, there's almost like

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.120
 a perpetual gun show going on in that, and there,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.400
 because like, and it's like this giant warehouse,

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.240
 just full of dealers who are just showing you AR-15s,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.760
 M-16s, rocket launchers, minis like,

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.040
 and then there's, then they have a range out bags.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.000
 It's like, "Well, go test fire it before you buy it."

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.720
 You know, it's like a test drive for a car, you know,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.520
 but you go out bag, "All right, here we go!"

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.520
 And then it's just, it's very loud, right?

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.360
 I'd be so tense all the time.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.200
 Funny thing is, they advertise it.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.360
 They advertise for it at the airport.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.120
 So you're on the moon and walkway and you're just

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.480
 driving and there's this chick with a gun and a bikini,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.320
 and you're like, "Hey, that's a place to go."

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.120
 I don't think they sell boots.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.560
 But I'm sure they're working on it.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.520
 Yeah.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.880
 Las Vegas is very much the James's shirt of America,

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.520
 because there's a permanent gun show going on at all times.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.640
 Quite, quite.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.720
 Yeah, 24/7.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.600
 Lock it in.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.760
 Amazing.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.760
 This is an amazing thing.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.920
 I can't believe I didn't know about big numbers.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.160
 Yeah.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.800
 So there have been two attempts in human history

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.440
 to estimate the number of particles in the universe, I think,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.480
 or two that have two big ones that we know about

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.520
 that have been written down.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.840
 So one of them was by Archimedes.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.520
 So this was over 2,000 years ago.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.280
 And he was estimating the number of grains of sand

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.160
 in the universe, actually.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.720
 But now we know how many particles in a grain of sand.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.720
 Arthur Eddington, 2,000 years later,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.720
 estimating the number of particles in the universe,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.080
 they came to exactly the same number.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.800
 No, no, really.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.560
 Isn't that completely insane?

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.560
 What's he just kind of copying off of art?

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.200
 Why is he published in ancient Greek, Mr. Eddington?

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.160
 Yeah.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.360
 Wow, never mind that.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.480
 Never mind that.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.040
 A pissed off would you be, though, when you realize

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.040
 you've got the exact same numbers, Archimedes.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.240
 Really?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.400
 I was five years.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.480
 I think you would add an extra couple to the end.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.840
 It's like 10 to the power of 72 plus 7.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.160
 So it doesn't look like you copied him, right?

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.840
 Well, there was a thing about Everest.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.280
 Because they measured Mount Everest.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.640
 And they found it came to a really annoyingly round number.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.280
 Is that right?

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:51.760
 Do you remember this?

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.000
 So is it actually not the tallest mountain in the world?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.880
 Is it?

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.320
 Yeah.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.640
 You know that-- I don't know if I'd said this on the podcast before--

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.480
 last year was the first year that no one's

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.280
 reached the top Mount Everest in 41 years,

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.080
 since it became a popular--

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.680
 Because all the shoppers went on the street.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.680
 No, it was just the conditions were really bad.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.880
 Because there were a few avalanches.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.080
 They closed off a couple of routes.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.680
 But they didn't close off like the extreme routes.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.680
 And the last chance was in December.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.840
 Someone got really close and then had to come back down.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.960
 It was the first year.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.440
 Really?

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:17.920
 Yeah.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.960
 And it lost an inch last year from the earthquake.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.160
 So you think it would have been easier?

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.840
 You tell me, Everest lost an inch.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.360
 It lost it is quite cold.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.800
 We know exactly what that feeling is like.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.600
 It's like, it's really chilly.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.480
 And OK, I'm not going to climb you tonight.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.040
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.200
 OK, it's time for fact number two.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.880
 And that is Chazinski.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.880
 Yeah, my fact is that Star Trek was almost not commissioned,

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.280
 because the pilot was considered too erotic.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.960
 Now, this fact entailed googling the phrase Star Trek erotic,

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.640
 which is quite dangerous.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.360
 I see you have a lot of paper there, which--

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.560
 So what's that?

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.080
 Well, so this was a pilot called The Cage.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.240
 It was the name of the episode.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.360
 It was sent to NBC in 1964.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.800
 And actually, I was very skeptical about how erotic it

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.520
 could really be, because it does sound quite raunchy.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.640
 It was the idea of the show was that a planet

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.080
 let out a call for help to the guys on the spaceship

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.880
 on the Star Trek spaceship.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.360
 And I'm obviously showing how much I know about the Star Trek

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.200
 spaceship.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200
 The Star Trek.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.200
 That was the original plan for the name of the ship.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.720
 We'll see.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.440
 And yeah, so they went down to this planet.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.440
 And actually, it was a plan.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.160
 And there was a beautiful alien on this planet

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.840
 to seduce the Star Trek spaceship crew members.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.600
 And because she had to have sex with them

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.120
 in order to repopulate this planet,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.800
 because it was suffering from population crisis.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.680
 So it was about someone being planted to seduce Captain Kirk,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.120
 who wasn't Captain Kirk at the time.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.280
 No, it was Captain Pike.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.320
 It was Captain Pike.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.520
 It was Captain Pike, wasn't it?

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.680
 Yeah, then the Pike was in the--

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.320
 Yeah, well, they brought it back because then they

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:06.120
 were able to use pieces of the original pilot in the episode.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.480
 And I can't remember the name of it,

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.360
 but it has to do with--

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.120
 Spock is on trial.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.320
 Captain Pike has been destroyed.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.840
 And he's in this chair.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.480
 And Captain Kirk is testifying on his behalf,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:22.960
 and they keep cutting to footage of the original pilot.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.520
 I was kind of a trek--

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.880
 I wasn't a trekky, but I used to watch it all the time

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.600
 because it was on in repeats.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.400
 So I watched it when I was a kid.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.480
 And I was just fascinated by it.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.480
 I was like, why does the future look so old?

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.280
 Yeah.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.040
 I mean, there's that used future look.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.920
 And then there's like, well, Christ, that's from the seven--

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.920
 I read the original plan for Mr. Spock.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.200
 Well, one of the original things for the design of the character

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.480
 was that he was going to not eat anything,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.000
 and that instead he would have a plate in the middle of his stomach

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.360
 and energy which struck the plate would be his food.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.960
 So he just feed off the cosmic radiation hits the plate.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.360
 So he'd be like, um, you know, photosynthesizing.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:03.960
 I suppose so.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.880
 So much.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.880
 Yeah.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.480
 Sounds great.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.720
 Something that I did.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.560
 James is dream.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.080
 Yeah.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.920
 I don't have to waste all this time having meals.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.320
 All the other day, Dan was saying to me the other day.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.640
 It's so relentless having to eat all the time.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.640
 There's three meals a day.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:17.600
 Why don't we don't talk about it more?

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.600
 It's bullshit.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.480
 Yeah, which is, again, I need to feed this thing again.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.800
 No, we have discussed this, and it's like my greatest joy.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.560
 And I can't believe you want to take that away from us.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.560
 I love eating.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.800
 Yeah, I love it.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.040
 But sometimes, I'm just like, I just want to day off.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.240
 Right, yeah.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.640
 Day off, immediately.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.040
 That's called the 5-2 diet.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.040
 Yeah.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.840
 There are products being developed, though, which are--

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.920
 I can't remember the name of them.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.680
 But they are basically nutritious mush,

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.920
 which really doesn't taste the very much at all.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.000
 But it leaves a selling as much as much.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.080
 Oh, wow.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.720
 There is a sea slug that's managed to get genes out of plants,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.440
 so it can eat like an animal, but it can also

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.880
 photosynthesize.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.680
 So I would like to get these plant genes into my body

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.760
 so I can sometimes photosynthesize as well.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.240
 Wow.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.000
 So while sunbathing, you're also eating.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Yeah, basically.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.560
 Well, that is the dream, actually.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.920
 Thinking about it now.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.000
 It's not my dream.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.840
 I hate to sunbathe.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.480
 I love to eat.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.160
 It sounds awful.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.400
 My favorite thing I found out about Star Trek, generally.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.840
 So created by Gene Roddenberry.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.720
 And there's a lot of rules.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.000
 He wrote this kind of Bible for a Star Trek of what

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.640
 would be, if you made an episode.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.280
 My favorite one is that he believed

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.120
 that there was no chest hair in the future.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.640
 Captain Kirk, in all the shots where he's naked,

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.360
 they were shaving his chest because there

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.080
 was no chest hair in the future.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.840
 He thought a head.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.040
 He thought evolutionaries.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.680
 Oh, so it's not a fashion thing.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.520
 In the future, he's not shaving it every day.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.720
 He just doesn't grow it.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.280
 He looks like the pinky toe.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.560
 We would just phase that out, because why not?

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.240
 What makes sense?

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.920
 I mean, do you think about it?

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.080
 Well, then I guess I'm the only one who can really recall it.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.160
 But then when the one episode where

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.280
 everyone goes a little crazy and Sulu's running around

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.920
 with the sword, completely, you know, he's got a bald chest.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.760
 Right.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.720
 Yeah.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.160
 Spock, when he's fighting Kirk on the planet,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.600
 and they have to fight each other, bald chest.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.440
 Or maybe Klingon's just didn't have chest hair.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.120
 I'm not sure.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.920
 No, Vulcans.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.760
 Yes, they're right.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.160
 God, what the hell was that?

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.000
 You know what?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.160
 Not a real face.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.920
 No, I'll walk away from the table now.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.040
 I'll come back in a second.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.600
 Dan has just saved us a lot of posts.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.600
 That's true.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.440
 Never had this.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.040
 So far, you are.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.640
 The worst was when we had Daniel Radcliffe on QI,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.440
 and he got the rules to quit it drunk.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.280
 No.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:34.760
 Oh, my God.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.720
 How many emails have we had about that?

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.280
 Well, maybe that's why Potter won so many matches.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.640
 That's true, the rules.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.800
 I'm a maverick.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.400
 I'm ready.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.680
 On the Vulcan thing, we have done this in a previous episode,

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.800
 but if you don't know, you might like it.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.240
 Which is that he was originally meant to be Martian.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.480
 He was meant to be from Mars.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.520
 Oh, when they were writing the scripts

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.600
 and getting everything approved, the people at the studio

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.160
 said, we think you need to change it,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.600
 because by the time this series goes out,

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.920
 and it's in its second series or something,

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.960
 we will have landed on Mars, and we will see Martians.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.320
 And some of that.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.320
 Yeah, and they were like, and that would make your series

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.440
 just look ridiculous.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.560
 That's.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.160
 He also had red skin at first.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.960
 He was supposed to have red skin, Spock.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.960
 But then it was in black and white a lot of the time

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.080
 and it turned out it looked like he just painted himself

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.680
 black, so he couldn't have red skin.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.440
 Oh, really?

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.960
 But also on skin painting, in that pilot,

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.440
 the seductuous, this woman who's supposed to seduce them all,

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.960
 is green.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.080
 And so she had to be painted in thick green paint,

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.400
 and it's quite hard and time-consuming to do that,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.200
 and so that it shows up properly on camera.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.800
 They filmed a test thing to see how it would work on camera.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.880
 They sent it away to be properly done.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.640
 They got the video back, and she looked normal skin color.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.440
 And they were like, my god, this hasn't worked.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.520
 And so they went through it all again, made it a bit thicker,

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.560
 a bit brighter green, sent the film away

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.040
 to get the video converted, to get the video back,

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:56.760
 got it back again.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.680
 And they were like, what is going on?

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.560
 She's still peach colored with a tiny bit of green tinge.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.040
 And it turned out the color technicians,

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.440
 when they got the film had gone--

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.600
 well, this is obviously an error.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.320
 They didn't mean to.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.600
 Something's gone wrong too.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.440
 So they stayed up all night every time,

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.440
 trying to make her skin color the--

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.800
 I made it hilarious.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.080
 James, don't we do a thing about how early TV--

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.080
 Oh, early film stars.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.400
 Did they wear green makeup?

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.080
 Yeah, you got the better on the black and white cameras.

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.480
 You know, did that.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.880
 Max Factor.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.920
 That's where the name Max Factor comes from.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.720
 He was like the greatest--

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.160
 at the time, he was the greatest film makeup artist.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.120
 And as they were starting to go from--

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:41.640
 like silent film to the different types of film and everything,

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.120
 it looked very oily, very--

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.720
 just very much like they were just painted with a bunch of--

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.960
 Yeah, when they were technical--

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.000
 So yeah, and so he spent--

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.440
 I want to say two years developing what

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.600
 is now widely known as the standard for film makeup.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.160
 And that's why-- after that, he started

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.600
 his own cosmetics line.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.560
 And that's where Max Factor comes from.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.440
 Oh, that's awesome, that's very cool.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.720
 T.S. Eliot used to paint his face a tiny bit green.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.360
 And no one really knows why.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.880
 So maybe he was just desperately hoping for a film deal.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.880
 No, no, no, no.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.320
 Where are they going to bring the wasteland to Hollywood?

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.920
 Now, talking about Star Trek, before we move on,

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.680
 a lot of people probably don't realize

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.440
 that one of the first interracial kisses on television

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.520
 was between Uhura and Kirk.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.020
 Yeah.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.800
 And at the time, it was very, very risque.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.120
 And they almost pulled it, because the censors thought

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.320
 it would be too inflammatory.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.360
 And honestly, they got a few letters, but other than that--

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:40.860
 Oh, really?

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.880
 Yeah, because--

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.840
 And I don't know if this is why they were able to pull it off,

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.640
 but they were both under the spell of--

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.240
 I can't remember what the character's name was,

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.560
 but they were basically forced to do it.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.120
 And that's how they were able to kind of get it through.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.160
 But yeah, that was the first interracial kiss on television.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.040
 I read that Uhura was going to leave,

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.480
 but then Martin Luther King like talks her out of it,

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.840
 and said, you're a trailblazing African-American woman who--

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.560
 Like, no matter what you think is happening,

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:15.440
 children watching you are seeing a black woman in space

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.840
 at the time was so radical.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.000
 It's one of the things I give credit for Rod and Barry.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.920
 He looked so--

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.320
 I mean, he was very misogynistic.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.320
 But he looked so far past color religion.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.480
 He did.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.480
 And that was the theme of a lot of Star Trek episodes.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.160
 Really, wasn't it?

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.600
 It was like this strange other alien, which actually

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.960
 isn't that strange, which is not--

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.320
 And it was weird, because a lot of the characters were not

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.480
 white in the '60s when that was a radical thing to do.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.320
 Yeah, Mr. Sulu, your hair.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.720
 Yeah, you just even--

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.720
 Check off.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720
 Check off.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:45.920
 Check off.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.320
 At the time, right in the middle of the Cold War, yeah.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.360
 Just one last thing on censors, because I was

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.960
 reading about the history of censorship on American TV.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:20:01.040
 So, in 1931, cows were not permitted in cartoons to have others.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.440
 They had to be pictured in a skirt.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.680
 Yeah, in a skirt?

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.920
 This is '31.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.680
 This is '31.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.520
 What happened again later?

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.960
 Because I found another source, really

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.960
 a book called America's First Network TV Sensor,

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.480
 which says that in 1958, cartoon cows

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.960
 were only permitted wearing skirts.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.080
 Was there a specific length of skirt they were allowed to wear?

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.800
 Well, they weren't allowed to wear a mini skirt.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.440
 I had to be quite a floral, nice loose flowing number.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.960
 So, you couldn't see their legs.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.960
 Yeah, that's-- where did they put it?

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.560
 I think this is why then they said cows had to stand upright,

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.800
 because they at first had them on four legs,

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.920
 and they had it halfway down their torso,

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.280
 and then it touches the ground.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.400
 Is that thing off the internet?

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.400
 The other week about where do you put dogs trousers?

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.440
 Like, they go round all four legs, or just the back two legs?

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.040
 No, yeah.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.240
 What if a dog wore trousers?

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.240
 If a dog wore trousers?

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.880
 Well, it would wear two pairs of trousers, wouldn't it?

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.840
 Well, you should've told the internet two weeks ago

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.480
 because they were all arguing about it.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.000
 Oh, that's amazing, yeah.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.080
 So, then even in 1940, there was a cow called Elsie,

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.320
 the boredom cow, who was a real cow fearing in a live-action film,

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.160
 and they said the others should be suggested rather than shown.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.120
 We'd rather see the bulge than the air.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.160
 In my country sometimes.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.160
 And it was pretty-- it's pretty weird.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:20.680
 OK, it's time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.240
 OK, my fact this week is that the Swiss city of Lossan

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.160
 has banned silent discos for being too loud.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.120
 They have party animals in Switzerland.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.280
 That's great, isn't it?

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.280
 Yeah.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.280
 So, why?

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.680
 They make a lot of noise apparently, because while you've

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.440
 got the headphones on, you're listening to music,

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.120
 and it's supposed to be silent, a lot of people

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.520
 are just singing along, or kind of bouncing around,

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.280
 or just shouting at each other.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.280
 Really?

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.160
 Yeah, at download, they have a special tent,

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.040
 specifically designed for silent discos.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:52.640
 OK.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.200
 Now, I was wandering around the grounds one time,

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.280
 trying to find one of the tents where my buddies were going

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.320
 to play, wandered into the silent disco tent,

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.520
 and was assaulted by this--

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.040
 I mean, it's an additional contact.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.480
 Like, it's like, there's a screaming stomp in.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.920
 It was much louder.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.240
 And then you look around, it's like, these people

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.480
 having fits, what is happening is I get backed out.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.720
 I'm not turning my back on them.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.360
 I mean, but I mean, they've got the lids on.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.440
 You know, you turn around.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.160
 Given it large, I was terrified.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.040
 I never went back.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.760
 Because I think we're saying that Los Anna's

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.480
 done the right thing.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.960
 They are on the right track.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.200
 I like a silent disco.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.920
 You can have the music nice and quiet,

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.280
 and you can wander out, if you can turn it right down.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.280
 I love it.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.880
 It really suits me.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.800
 Everyone else is rocking out at download,

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.040
 and Andy's listening to Radio 4.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.720
 And now the shipping forecast.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.040
 Woo!

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.360
 Dogger, fair bank.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.120
 So maybe we're saying this is a sensible thing.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.040
 It seems that way.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.640
 Yeah, I wasn't really old-fay with the silent disco,

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.000
 but it seems that, yeah, they're right.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.360
 They're really good, but the thing is, you get people--

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.800
 because often they have two DJs, or even three,

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.520
 playing different tunes.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.160
 So people are dancing to different rhythms and different beats.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.520
 So people-- I think people care a bit less what they look like,

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.040
 whether they're dancing.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.360
 You don't get as much kind of posey dancing.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.800
 Yeah, because you could be saying,

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.280
 I'm totally in rhythm, by the way, to what I'm listening to.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.200
 You just don't know that.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.080
 It's not obvious when you're not dancing in tune.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.880
 Or singing in tune, I guess.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.160
 A lot of them have their eyes closed,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.200
 constantly running into each other.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.400
 It's very different tempos.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.640
 So it's like-- honestly, it's like watching CCTV footage

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.160
 of the damned, just outside the gates.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.320
 It's getting ready.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.280
 Do you know where silent disco comes from?

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:45.560
 No.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.440
 Or when it comes from.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.080
 So this is-- well, the theory online

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.720
 is that it dates back to a 1969 Finnish sci-fi film

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.920
 called, I'm going to miss a pronounciate, as well.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.160
 Lucien Aia, which means "Time of Roses,"

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.880
 and people all wear headphones to a party.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.640
 And that's the first time it was ever seen in popular culture.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.240
 There were definitely listening to stuff,

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.640
 because sometimes I didn't want to miss,

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.960
 but I put my headphones on in the office,

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.920
 so people don't talk to me.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.520
 But I'm not actually listening to anything.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.280
 That's all right.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:12.800
 Yeah.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.560
 What's your advantage now?

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.000
 Well, they're doing that.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.400
 They were just like, I'll go to the party,

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.560
 but I'm not speaking to anybody, keeping my headphones on.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.240
 But that's really interesting, because when was--

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.320
 So 1969.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.880
 And it's set in 2012.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.440
 So when was the audio--

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.480
 sorry, when were cassettes?

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.920
 Audio cassettes invented.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.160
 Oh, '80s?

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.640
 Because what were they, late '70s?

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.080
 Yeah, because it was headphones, even,

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.080
 a concept of a thing you take out.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.360
 It just held off the ground with it.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.040
 Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.760
 In America, the giant headphones

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.200
 have been around for quite a while.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.640
 They kind of went hand in hand with the high-five system

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.640
 that were sold in the early '60s.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.440
 OK, the first ever jukebox was made by Edison.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.400
 And he had some kind of music system.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.560
 And there was like stethoscopes that would come down,

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.040
 like five different people would kind of put the stethoscopes

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.160
 next to the ears and listen.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.360
 So that's kind of headphones.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:54.880
 Yeah.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.840
 And they used to come with a towel that you could clean it

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.560
 after, well, before you would use it.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.560
 That's fantastic.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.240
 So you wouldn't catch ear diseases, obviously.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.080
 It is.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.280
 It was famous ear diseases.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.560
 There's a guy called George Foy,

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.640
 who lived in New York where it's loud and he had some kids

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.240
 who were making noise.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.520
 And he decided he would go on a quest to find the quietest place

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.040
 on the planet.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.120
 And he's obsessed with finding quiet places.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.040
 But he says, and he's been inside the anechoic chamber

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.520
 in Massachusetts.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.760
 Yes, many apples.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.880
 Many apples.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.440
 And he's clarified that there is no such thing as silence.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.080
 And he said he found it really annoying going inside

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.840
 this chamber, which didn't drive him mad,

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.000
 like it drives other people mad.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.720
 But I have read that the longest anyone's ever

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.160
 spent in an anechoic chamber is 45 minutes.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:33.800
 He beat that?

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.320
 Did he?

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.360
 Yeah, because he was fine with it.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.920
 And they actually had to kind of break the door down

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.680
 to get him out.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.200
 Did they?

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.200
 It's just something great time.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.600
 Did they not have a hand door?

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.600
 To have a door?

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:44.920
 That's a design for us.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.760
 Oh, it's not what you're really sure.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.040
 Well, I've been to an anechoic--

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.680
 I've been to a semi anechoic chamber.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.200
 Yeah, I knew.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.120
 Wait, what's a semi one?

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.240
 Well, there's some noise because that's just a defeat.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:54.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.680
 I was with you.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.200
 Yeah, you were.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:56.720
 Yeah.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.480
 It's the echo.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.360
 It's the lack of echo.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.800
 So you can make noise.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.040
 But it's just it won't bounce back at you.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.320
 And so with this one, there was a flaw, which

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.040
 was just normal, and all the other walls

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.760
 were kind of had this special stuff that stopped any echoes.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.640
 And did it-- was it weird?

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.600
 Yeah, it was really weird.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.080
 It was hard.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:12.960
 Really, really weird.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.440
 Yeah.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.360
 Do you know the most echoey place in the entire world?

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.920
 It's this massive oil tank in Scotland.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.200
 It's in a place called Inchendown.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.400
 And they dug these huge oil tanks

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.480
 into a hillside during the Second World War

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.080
 to store millions and millions of gallons of oil

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.520
 because they need to fuel ships, which were more

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.960
 to the nearest naval base.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.000
 But they didn't want it to be a risk of bombers,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.160
 long-range German bombers.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.640
 So they had to dig it into the hill.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.240
 The only way to get in is through one of these four tiny pipes.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.680
 They're 46 centimeters across.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.920
 So it's a squeeze.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.280
 But when you get inside there, they've

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.800
 got inside and tested it.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.080
 And the way you test it, by the way, is firing a blank epistol

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.160
 loaded with blanks and see how long it takes.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.160
 And see how long the echo takes.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.760
 Why can't you just say echo?

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.280
 Right.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.800
 It's just a standard way of doing it.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.520
 There are more modern ways.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:04.480
 But the echo in this chamber lost 112 seconds.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.400
 You're kidding.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:05.920
 Wow.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.760
 Oh, my God.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.280
 That's so cool.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.960
 We played a place the other night.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.240
 It was this hall in Frankfurt in Germany.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.480
 And the delay in there was seven seconds long,

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.120
 because it was just so cavernous.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.640
 Wow.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.240
 And even when you get people in there,

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.480
 I mean, it's such a battle for us to dial in the sound.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.920
 I'm really going to fight that.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.600
 Wasn't that unbelievably distracting?

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:29.520
 Well, we bring our own PA system with us.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.440
 So we're able to really control that.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.120
 Plus, we have probably one of the best sound

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.280
 guys in the business.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.600
 He is able to really control that.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.080
 And he's spent so many hours.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.360
 And so many-- he knows how to really dial it in.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.520
 Yeah, I was pretty intense.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.440
 So that was seven seconds.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.640
 That was seven seconds.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.280
 I can't even count 112.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.760
 I mean, it's incredible.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.360
 I mean, it's just hanging there.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.240
 And I mean, it's something like that.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:00.200
 The decay rate has to just be in just sick, because it's feeding

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.400
 itself.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.480
 I'd love to go in there and do some vocals.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.680
 I've done vocals at the bottom of a well before.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.680
 Really?

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.280
 Yeah, I don't really recommend it, because you're wet.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.040
 So it was this part of like a plan.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.240
 Well, did you just decide to do it?

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.320
 Yeah, well, we were reporting stuff for slipknot.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.080
 And we were recording it out.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.720
 It was when we were doing all of it was gone, which

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.200
 was the fourth album.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.640
 And we were out at our buddies.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.880
 It was a place called Soundform.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.680
 It was basically, he lives there, and he's got a studio there.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.040
 So we were doing a lot of experimental stuff.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.200
 You know, just to kind of get away from like the Pro Tools

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.560
 plugins and everything like that.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.040
 It's like, let's try and capture something unique.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.320
 So they fished me down the bottom of this well,

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.880
 because you know, they had a proper well down there.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.720
 It was deep, very dark.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.120
 And of course, we waited until the sun had gone down to do it.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.320
 I was like, this was poor planning on our work.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.840
 But then we fished a telephone in U87 down.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.080
 And I was able to kind of do-- and it was just this kind of spoken

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.360
 word thing that we were just doing again.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.960
 But the reaction, just picked it up, was really, really cool.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.120
 So I loved doing stuff like that.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.120
 I'm all about it.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:08.840
 Is it true?

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.720
 Because it's online this about you that your vocal range is--

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.760
 Oh, it's the biggest vocal range?

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.160
 What was it?

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.520
 No, it's not big.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.880
 It's in metal.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.360
 Apparently, I have a pretty good range.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.960
 Five and a half octaves, yeah, octaves.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.800
 But I didn't even know that, to be honest, you know?

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.080
 Like I was like--

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.040
 It was just a good thing about the internet.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.400
 Well, I can't sing that, but I can sing this.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.720
 That's really-- that's the end of my gig.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.440
 But so that rate, the high range, the screen,

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.840
 got you into getting a gig on top of you, right?

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.520
 Well, yeah, well, the low grow was really--

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.040
 Right, it was really.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.080
 --what did it, yeah.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.240
 Then the guys who directed it, Daniel Hera,

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.680
 who I just saw last night, came to the gig,

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.920
 they were-- he, like, he had a couple of producers.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.960
 A lot of the people there were, like, huge slipmap fans

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.640
 growing up, and I was like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.560
 And they were like, they-- when we played in Cardiff last year

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.080
 where they filmed, and they took us to the doctor who

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.760
 experienced, so I'm just freaking out, you know?

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.520
 Like, we were there for hours.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.800
 And they were like, we got to go.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.800
 We got to get them, like, but no.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.560
 They took us to BBC Cardiff, or BBC Whale, excuse me.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.560
 And they walked us through some of the sets,

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.240
 and everything, and then they were like,

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.840
 so we've got this idea.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.840
 And I'm like, yeah, yeah.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.680
 And I described the Fisher King, who

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.640
 was the alien who I provided the screen for.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.000
 And then Peter, and I can't pronounce his last name, Sirif.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:35.840
 There it is.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.800
 There it is, thank you.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.200
 Thank you for that, because I butcher it every time.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.360
 He did the spoken voice.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:48.480
 And I did the growl, so it was kind of a cool mashup.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.480
 A duet.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.480
 Yeah.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.480
 It's basic, essentially.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.480
 Yeah.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.480
 I mean, I let him take the lead.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.480
 He's pretty good.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.480
 Still.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.720
 But yeah, so I just, I went, I'd screened for about 45 minutes,

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.760
 and they were like, well, you've got plenty.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.760
 That's it.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.760
 And I went and did the gig.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.560
 We actually only asked for three seconds, but thanks for--

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.960
 You've quite overdid it.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.880
 Anyone got anything else?

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.200
 An amusing noise complaint.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.640
 I saw-- so this is a big sign that somebody

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.920
 left outside someone else's house when that person

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.080
 had been keeping them up all night with their loud music

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.160
 and their partying.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.840
 And the sign says, to the people that kept us awake all night

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:29.560
 by singing on the balcony, 223 AM pinball wizard, 3 out of 10.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.120
 Your performance of this would cause

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.760
 the band more shame than Pete Townsend's liberal attitude.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:41.000
 315 AM walk this way, the lowest point of the performance.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.760
 I hate this song, 1 out of 10.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.000
 But then 820 AM.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.520
 So you know, this has gone on a while.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.000
 Tiny dancer, actually very good, 7 out of 10.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.720
 Oh, I think they're a bad critic, because that's

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.840
 very good, 7 out of 10 is a little bit harsh, yeah.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.280
 Yeah, it's harsh.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.640
 All right, time for our final fact of the show.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.680
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.440
 My fact this week is that the giant squid's brain

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.160
 is wrapped around its throat.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.480
 So if it eats anything too large, it risks brain injury.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.160
 It feels like a design flaw, doesn't it?

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.160
 It does.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.160
 Oh, good.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.760
 I know, but they've got to do a lot with a little space,

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.280
 because they've got this thing called the mantle,

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.760
 which is basically everything except the tentacles,

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.560
 and they have to fit a huge amount of stuff in there.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:30.000
 And so they feed through this sort of the hole

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.680
 in the middle of the mantle, and they have a beak,

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.280
 and they have all sorts of strange features.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.480
 And so their brain is wrapped around their esophagus.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.400
 Yeah, how stressful.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.400
 It's crazy.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.560
 Every meal.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.600
 Every meal.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.400
 That would put me off eating if I was going to be brain damage

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.400
 every time I did.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.480
 I just have to chew, that's all it is.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.000
 Yeah.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.440
 And there's one of very few things that we know

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.720
 about the giant squid, because we know so little.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.240
 Yeah.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:52.920
 We don't know how they hunt.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.160
 We don't know how many species there are.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.640
 There might be-- they think there might be up to eight

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.280
 different species of giant squid.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.360
 So they've obviously got eight tentacles,

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.280
 but then they've got two feeding tentacles as well.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:08.560
 So the feeding tentacles can stretch out to 33 feet.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.520
 That's what they found in--

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.840
 so imagine you've seen a squid ages away,

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.360
 and you're like, I'm pretty safe here.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.800
 You can just lob these two feeding arms and grab you

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:20.040
 and bring you back like a big tongue on a lizard.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.040
 But they won't be able to swallow you down.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.680
 You're way bigger than that.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.880
 I was in my head, as I said that, I was a fish.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.600
 Yeah, yeah, I was picturing myself swimming along,

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.880
 going, oh, I'm safe here.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.840
 Eating a mole.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.840
 Yeah.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.320
 They aren't-- they are the signs of a bus, aren't they?

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.520
 They are enormous.

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.960
 They're so-- some of them are as long as--

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.520
 so basically the maximum length, including the tentacles,

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.800
 is 13 meters.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.320
 Yeah.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.760
 Some of them will be the feeding tentacles.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.760
 But still, that's big.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:46.800
 That's a cheat, though, I would say,

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.920
 because if you grew like an eyebrow hair really, really long,

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.160
 you could say, wow, I'm actually this length.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.040
 Because those are just two little tentacle arms.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.400
 You count your legs when you're talking about how tall you are.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.680
 Why no, but that's true.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.440
 And you care?

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.120
 You count your arms, which are your feeding tentacles.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.720
 Yeah, but if I'm talking about a bus,

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.360
 I'm not going to talk about a bus that has two extra poles

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.400
 hanging out at the top and going, get on my massive pole.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:12.000
 Well, which bus are you going to say, get on my massive pole?

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.720
 There was footage of that one kind of washing up next to a ship.

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.440
 I want to say it was fishing just off

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.960
 like maybe the Alaskan coast.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.800
 But it was quite big, and it was caught in one of the nets,

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.560
 and it took them forever to do--

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.480
 To this entangle?

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.400
 Yeah, I mean, it was big.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.840
 I mean, this was a big ship.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.680
 You know, this was one of the crabbing ships.

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.520
 And Christ, it was half, like maybe three quarters,

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.760
 as long as the ship itself--

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:39.760
 Yeah.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.720
 It was like, oh, god.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:46.040
 Someone called, like, the squid police in Weymouth,

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.080
 I think, the squid police.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.080
 Yeah.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.080
 It's the official name.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:50.960
 Yeah, that's what you call it.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.040
 It's 9/9/10.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.040
 9/9/10, to call.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.080
 To call.

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.640
 Oh, well done.

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.280
 Someone called the squid police, saying that giant squids

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.440
 washed up on a beach, and it turned out

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.200
 to be a mink whale, which is huge.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.800
 So they look like whales when they're dumped on beaches.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.160
 There's at least huge, formless lumps.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.320
 They're huge lumps of rain.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.080
 Yeah.

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.880
 And they have the biggest eyeballs in nature, don't they?

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.880
 Yeah.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.280
 Gigantic eyeballs.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.680
 So all animals, I think, the eyes evolved one time.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.080
 But I think the squid, I think the eyes,

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.600
 evolved completely separately, even

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.520
 though they do exactly the same thing.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.280
 So it's like eyeballs have evolved twice

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.880
 in two different types of animals.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.880
 Really?

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.880
 That's right.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.880
 Because of the deaths that they have--

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.680
 Yeah, I think that's right.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.680
 Probably.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.360
 I was looking into why they have these enormous eyes.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.320
 And there's a really good paper from 2012

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.080
 by a team led by Dan Erick Nelson to shout out to him

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.920
 that is to help them spot sperm whales who are their main predators.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.420
 So they've got--

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.680
 So he did a paper.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.440
 And the question was, why do they have eyes?

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.960
 And the answer was, so they can see things.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.920
 No, no, hang on.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.680
 But why the three times wider than almost any other animal,

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.520
 apart from colossal squid, which is the other kind,

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.040
 anyway, I don't know if I remember that.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.440
 So sperm whales are the main things that hunt them.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.840
 And 600 meters down, using an eye that size,

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.680
 you could spot 120 meters away a sperm whale.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.160
 But sperm whales have got sonar.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.960
 So they can identify a giant squid from a long way away.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.640
 So it's really just to give them any kind of advantage

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.520
 and a head start and getting away.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.360
 And lots of sperm whales, when they wash up,

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.560
 well, when they die, they've got scars all over them,

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.960
 which we think are from grappling with squid,

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.960
 and they're not always tentable.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.560
 No, it's not what it's from.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.360
 I was wondering what it was when I was looking at the pictures

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.280
 of those ones that washed up.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.360
 They've got their scratches all down their backs.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.360
 Yeah.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.360
 And they think that about three quarters

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.920
 of everything sperm whales eat is giant squid.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.160
 From the number of squid beaks they find in the stomachs

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:34.680
 of the whales.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.840
 So that it's a huge, they have these enormous battles

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.160
 underwater.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.680
 There's probably one happening right now.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.680
 Yeah.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.400
 Right around the spotlight now.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.960
 You know squid ink.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.000
 So it's--

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.600
 Not personally, but we have mutual friends.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.560
 Yeah, it's a metal band.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.160
 You guys are going to have a lot.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.680
 Yeah, they're from Shibuya, Wisconsin.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.040
 Shout out, squid ink.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.920
 So they actually do two batches of squid ink

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.200
 that go out when they're using as a defense system.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.360
 So the first batch is kind of pure ink.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.280
 It's very inky.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.280
 And it's meant to create a blob so they can create a distraction.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:12.920
 The second batch is a more mucusy little bit of ink.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.080
 So it's mixed with mucus.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.840
 And the idea is that when they spit this out,

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.600
 that they are creating a shape that looks exactly like them.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.240
 So it's like a decoy.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.240
 It's like this weird squid looking decoy.

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.960
 So it's like a squid hologram.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.800
 Exactly.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.920
 And they've got video observation of animals

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.920
 that were going after the squid then going for this.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.200
 And being like, well, what was the squid?

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.160
 And he's off.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:37.920
 That's so cool.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.960
 Yeah, it was nice.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.000
 I love that.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.600
 Yeah, that is rare.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.760
 That's intelligent.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.720
 Male squid have to be quite careful what they do with their sperm.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.360
 Because the way they inseminate a lady's squid

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.680
 is they deposit these sperm packets,

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.280
 these sperm intervals into a little pouch on her body.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.440
 But she loves to eat them.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.840
 That's really what she likes doing best

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.840
 is to get like reach around with her tentacles,

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.280
 pick the sperm out and eat it.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.640
 So that's obviously a problem for the man

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.200
 because or the male squid.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.720
 Because that means that he doesn't get his offspring out

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.680
 of her because she's just eaten his potential offspring.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.680
 If I am a nickel.

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:16.480
 It's all right as miles away.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.800
 You can empathize.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.080
 There you go.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:23.000
 So when she eats the sperm that you may have deposited on her,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.160
 it actually helps her to develop her unfertilized egg.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.400
 And so it helps out the next guy, his competitor that comes along.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.160
 So you've got to really make sure that so that's why

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.760
 someone is when you deposit your sperm into a female's pouch.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.520
 They try and get it really, really deeply in

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.400
 because so that she can't actually reach around to it

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.800
 and get it out.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.960
 Another species called the coastal squid.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.480
 And it's usually the bigger males that are successful

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.360
 with the females.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.320
 But they're also sneaky males or sneaker males.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.400
 And they're much smaller.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.480
 But what they do is when the female is about to lay her egg,

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.400
 she lays it out of her front.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.960
 And they deposit sperm on her face.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.160
 And then when the egg comes out, then it kind of collects their sperm.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.640
 And their sperm is much bigger than the other males.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.120
 I'm not sure we can safely say anything about it.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.920
 I'm back here just biting my sperm.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.560
 For his like, those nickels are really primed up to God.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.880
 Giant squid have penises, but other squid don't.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.000
 Do you think they ever like trick people by saying,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.080
 I have a giant squid penis?

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:29.200
 And then it's unclear which bit the giant is referring to.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.360
 I like to think they do.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.440
 I hope they do.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.400
 So you're saying it's like, sorry.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:40.880
 Are you saying that it's a giant squid penis or a giant squid penis?

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.120
 It's actually an extremely small giant squid penis.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:51.400
 Of all the giant squid penises I've had to deal with.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.120
 And I'm just saying, there's been quite a few.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.160
 Yours is by far the smallest of that.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.120
 I was just reminded of that.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.840
 Are you saying four candles?

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.800
 I'm saying four candles.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.920
 That was the four candles.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.200
 In an original draft of this catch,

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.640
 it was about giant squid pieces.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.480
 I've learned so much today.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.440
 So happy.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.960
 So this is a really gross idea.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.280
 So there was a woman in South Korea recently who was eating squid.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.280
 So we all eat squid.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.000
 We call it Kalamari for reasons I don't understand.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.800
 But she was eating some boiled squid in a restaurant.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.840
 And she suddenly felt a pain in her tongue.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.680
 And it turned out the squid wasn't quite dead.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.600
 And it was a male squid.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.280
 And it had deposited its sperm packet into her tongue.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.920
 So she felt horrible pain in her tongue.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.560
 And then felt lots of stuff crawling around inside her tongue

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.840
 and had to go to hospital.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.200
 And they took out a whole bunch of sperm.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.720
 And apparently this does happen a bit like there's

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.520
 been reports in Japan of it happening.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.520
 Oh, that's so fucked up.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.200
 No one's never fucking hit that shit again.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.960
 Oh my god.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.760
 Yeah.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.280
 Fuck it.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.280
 Oh.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.280
 Fuck that.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.960
 Fuck that shit.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.960
 Vegetarianism, here you come.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.640
 It had to be in the tongue.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.640
 Why?

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:11.960
 OK, that's it.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.960
 That's all of our facts.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.120
