00:00:00,00:00:01,"Hi everyone, just before we start this episode,"
00:00:01,00:00:04,wanted to drop in that it's our 100th birthday.
00:00:04,00:00:07,We have been going for 100 years.
00:00:07,00:00:08,Time has flown.
00:00:08,00:00:10,"No, it's our 100th episode."
00:00:10,00:00:12,And so happy birthday to us.
00:00:12,00:00:15,Thanks so much for sticking with us for our 100 full episodes.
00:00:15,00:00:18,And this is just the 100th.
00:00:18,00:00:18,Where's that 100 to many times?
00:00:18,00:00:20,"There's no big deals, just a 100."
00:00:20,00:00:21,Just a 100. Just a 100.
00:00:21,00:00:22,100. For all the show.
00:00:22,00:00:32,[MUSIC]
00:00:32,00:00:36,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:36,00:00:40,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:40,00:00:41,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:41,00:00:43,"I'm sitting here with Andy Murray,"
00:00:43,00:00:46,"Ange Zinski, James Harkin, and a special guest"
00:00:46,00:00:50,making his second appearance as first being as a secret track on our vinyl.
00:00:50,00:00:54,It's Stone Sour and Slipknot's frontman Corey Taylor.
00:00:54,00:00:56,"And once again, we've gathered around the microphones"
00:00:56,00:00:58,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:58,00:01:01,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:01,00:01:02,"Starting with you, Corey."
00:01:02,00:01:03,"Oh, the honors, yes."
00:01:03,00:01:09,My fact is a million seconds is 11.5 days.
00:01:09,00:01:13,A billion seconds is 32 years.
00:01:13,00:01:18,"So that is bizarre because just basically because of the vast difference,"
00:01:18,00:01:21,you think that a billion is a bit more than a million.
00:01:21,00:01:23,"And when we talk about billions and trillions,"
00:01:23,00:01:25,"when you hear about trillion dollar debt or billion dollar debt,"
00:01:25,00:01:28,you kind of think they're essentially the same thing.
00:01:28,00:01:29,And yeah.
00:01:29,00:01:32,I know. I know. So I only just found out there's no zillion.
00:01:32,00:01:34,I thought that was a thing.
00:01:34,00:01:36,"I know it's a billion, billion, zillion."
00:01:36,00:01:37,Not a thing at all.
00:01:37,00:01:40,"It jumps to, I think there's one in between,"
00:01:40,00:01:44,"but there's a Google and then there's a Google Place, is that right?"
00:01:44,00:01:45,"That's a massive, yeah."
00:01:45,00:01:46,Which are quite large.
00:01:46,00:01:51,So a Google is one with a hundred zeros and a Googleplex is one with a Google zeros.
00:01:51,00:01:54,"Because you can't write out a Googleplex because if there are more zeros,"
00:01:54,00:01:56,then there are atoms in the universe.
00:01:56,00:01:58,"I think so, yeah. That's the problem."
00:01:58,00:01:59,That's the problem for me.
00:01:59,00:02:01,"Otherwise, we'd all be doing it."
00:02:01,00:02:03,That's why we let the computers do it.
00:02:03,00:02:09,"But so it wasn't at the case that billion in America used to be a different billion, too."
00:02:09,00:02:12,"No, we've half copied America, but half not copied it."
00:02:12,00:02:14,So a billion means two different things now.
00:02:14,00:02:17,So a billion in America is a thousand million.
00:02:17,00:02:19,"And in the UK, it's generally a thousand million now,"
00:02:19,00:02:21,but also sometimes it's a million million.
00:02:21,00:02:25,"Since 1974, they officially have the standard"
00:02:25,00:02:27,where we have the American shot billion now.
00:02:27,00:02:29,I can only apologize.
00:02:29,00:02:30,Sorry.
00:02:30,00:02:32,But it's a lot easier for us all to become billionaires.
00:02:32,00:02:34,"Well, I guess so."
00:02:34,00:02:35,"Yeah, that's why we all are."
00:02:35,00:02:38,Why are they only billionaires sitting at the street?
00:02:38,00:02:43,You know how long ago it was a trillion years ago?
00:02:43,00:02:44,A trillion years ago.
00:02:44,00:02:45,I know exactly how long ago it was a trillion years ago.
00:02:45,00:02:46,"In seconds, please."
00:02:46,00:02:50,"No, do you know how many a trillion seconds ago?"
00:02:50,00:02:51,How many years ago that was?
00:02:51,00:02:53,It's always that a thousand billion.
00:02:53,00:02:54,Yes.
00:02:54,00:02:54,Okay.
00:02:54,00:02:58,"So it's 31,710 years ago."
00:02:58,00:03:01,And that was about the first time humans started eating porridge.
00:03:01,00:03:03,Really?
00:03:03,00:03:03,Yeah.
00:03:03,00:03:04,"Oh, it's good."
00:03:04,00:03:05,What a big day.
00:03:05,00:03:09,I wonder what they ate up until that point.
00:03:09,00:03:10,"Yeah, breakfast, nothing."
00:03:10,00:03:11,"Breakfast, nothing."
00:03:11,00:03:12,"Breakfast, porridge."
00:03:12,00:03:16,"Yes, it's still eating it."
00:03:16,00:03:17,Yeah.
00:03:17,00:03:18,"I mean, I'm a billionaire."
00:03:18,00:03:22,"I ate meat, carbs, right off the animal."
00:03:22,00:03:27,That's probably what they were having before they were having porridge.
00:03:27,00:03:27,Breakfast.
00:03:27,00:03:30,"Yeah, well, I'm saying, you know, we've gone, you know, I've gone backwards."
00:03:30,00:03:31,"You know, I'm keeping it real."
00:03:31,00:03:34,Was there anything else that was going on then?
00:03:34,00:03:35,"Do you know, James?"
00:03:35,00:03:37,"Yeah, it was about the same time as the first"
00:03:37,00:03:39,cave paintings in Europe.
00:03:39,00:03:40,Corolla.
00:03:40,00:03:42,I believe Bruce Forsyth was also born.
00:03:42,00:03:44,"Oh, yeah, I don't know."
00:03:44,00:03:45,"Hey, is the one English joke ahead?"
00:03:45,00:03:47,"Yeah, it's a good one, right?"
00:03:47,00:03:49,Sorry.
00:03:49,00:03:50,Strong cultural reference.
00:03:50,00:03:51,So impressive.
00:03:51,00:03:52,I know my thing.
00:03:52,00:03:56,"Well, it would be the American version of that"
00:03:56,00:03:57,someone who's like really old.
00:03:57,00:03:59,Of Bruce Forsyth?
00:03:59,00:04:00,Yeah.
00:04:00,00:04:02,"Maybe, but I don't even know if he's still alive."
00:04:02,00:04:03,Bob Hope.
00:04:03,00:04:04,"Bob Hope, yeah."
00:04:04,00:04:05,"Oh, he did, I said."
00:04:05,00:04:07,"Yeah, he made it to 100 though."
00:04:07,00:04:07,Yeah.
00:04:07,00:04:08,"Although it turns out,"
00:04:08,00:04:10,I was reading this thing about Bob Hope
00:04:10,00:04:13,"that he actually lied about his birthday just for a sort of like,"
00:04:13,00:04:14,he just knocked it a year younger.
00:04:14,00:04:17,"Well, he was only like 26."
00:04:17,00:04:18,"No, no, yeah."
00:04:18,00:04:22,"No, so he, I just think just for some kind of reason,"
00:04:22,00:04:23,he knocked it a year back.
00:04:23,00:04:26,"So secretly, he knew he'd hit 100."
00:04:26,00:04:26,Yeah.
00:04:26,00:04:28,But he couldn't tell anyone.
00:04:28,00:04:30,"So then when he hit 100 officially in the country,"
00:04:30,00:04:31,"they're like, happy birthday,"
00:04:31,00:04:32,but he would have been over it by then.
00:04:32,00:04:34,"Yeah, well, he's just greedy and whatever."
00:04:34,00:04:35,He saw himself in the foot there.
00:04:35,00:04:37,He was originally named like Bob Hope.
00:04:37,00:04:38,Yeah.
00:04:38,00:04:41,"And one of the great things the Buddha could do, apparently,"
00:04:41,00:04:43,"according to Buddhist legenders,"
00:04:43,00:04:44,"can't really, really high."
00:04:44,00:04:45,Really high.
00:04:45,00:04:48,"He, well, super high, James, I'll tell you how high."
00:04:48,00:04:49,"A mathematician asked him,"
00:04:49,00:04:51,"""What's the highest number you know?"""
00:04:51,00:04:52,"And so the Buddha said, ""Well, I know this number."""
00:04:52,00:04:54,That's a bit different.
00:04:54,00:04:55,Yeah.
00:04:55,00:04:56,He could name it though.
00:04:56,00:04:58,He's the guy who probably came up with Zillian
00:04:58,00:04:59,"in a panicked moment,"
00:04:59,00:05:01,"but like a Zillian, I can count out two."
00:05:01,00:05:02,"Right before he said, ""Good Jillian."""
00:05:02,00:05:03,Yeah.
00:05:03,00:05:05,"And then the mathematician said to Buddha,"
00:05:05,00:05:07,"""What about Zillian and what?"""
00:05:07,00:05:08,Yeah.
00:05:08,00:05:09,Huh?
00:05:09,00:05:11,"In your face, Buddha."
00:05:11,00:05:14,"And on this basis, a great religion was founded."
00:05:14,00:05:17,"There was a really good article in I-09,"
00:05:17,00:05:21,which I love about how we can't even comprehend
00:05:21,00:05:22,"this million billion, these massive numbers thing."
00:05:22,00:05:24,Humans haven't evolved to comprehend them.
00:05:24,00:05:26,"Like, when we were, you know, 3000 years ago,"
00:05:26,00:05:28,"4000 years ago, we didn't need to think about anything"
00:05:28,00:05:31,except people in our immediate vicinity.
00:05:31,00:05:33,"We didn't have much astronomical knowledge,"
00:05:33,00:05:33,stuff like that.
00:05:33,00:05:35,So we didn't have all these big numbers.
00:05:35,00:05:37,"So this article that was written by someone called,"
00:05:37,00:05:39,"a mathematician called Spencer Greenberg,"
00:05:39,00:05:41,is talking about how you can make numbers
00:05:41,00:05:44,be more manageable or make huge things seem more manageable.
00:05:44,00:05:47,"So like, for instance, the time thing is one."
00:05:47,00:05:50,So you say you could do this over a certain amount of time.
00:05:50,00:05:52,Another one is breaking stuff down.
00:05:52,00:05:56,"So if you say the US has $17 trillion of debt,"
00:05:56,00:05:57,the best thing to do there is actually say
00:05:57,00:06:00,"that's $54,000 of debt per person."
00:06:00,00:06:02,"See, this is the problem because you say,"
00:06:02,00:06:04,how many dollars was it for every person in America?
00:06:04,00:06:06,"54,000."
00:06:06,00:06:09,"So I can't picture 300 million people,"
00:06:09,00:06:10,which is about the population of the USA.
00:06:10,00:06:12,"So that's where it all falls down, unfortunately."
00:06:12,00:06:16,It's a manageable amount of money for an unimaginable amount of money.
00:06:16,00:06:18,"Unfortunately, a lot of Americans can handle 54,000."
00:06:18,00:06:22,"In Germany, after the war,"
00:06:22,00:06:24,they had very bad inflation
00:06:24,00:06:27,"and things started costing, you know, 10,000 marks."
00:06:27,00:06:28,This is after World War One.
00:06:28,00:06:29,"Yeah, exactly."
00:06:29,00:06:34,"And they had this mental disorder called zero stroke or cypher stroke,"
00:06:34,00:06:36,where people just kept writing down zeroes all the time
00:06:36,00:06:38,because they just couldn't deal with these massive numbers.
00:06:38,00:06:39,Really?
00:06:39,00:06:41,"And you would ask them, how many kids do you have?"
00:06:41,00:06:44,"And they'd be like, I've got 10 trillion children,"
00:06:44,00:06:45,or how old are you?
00:06:45,00:06:47,Seven billion years old or something.
00:06:47,00:06:49,So interesting.
00:06:49,00:06:51,Because they just couldn't deal with these massive numbers.
00:06:51,00:06:52,Wow.
00:06:52,00:06:58,"In 2009, Zimbabwe printed 100 trillion Zimbabwe and dollar notes."
00:06:58,00:06:58,I have one.
00:06:58,00:06:59,Do you?
00:06:59,00:07:03,"And it's worth like something, like 20 pounds or something."
00:07:03,00:07:05,"Yeah, I think I bought mine for about five."
00:07:05,00:07:06,"Nice, okay."
00:07:06,00:07:07,You've got it on the cheap.
00:07:07,00:07:09,"James collects these kind of things, though,"
00:07:09,00:07:12,just so he can pull things out of his wallet to impress you.
00:07:12,00:07:14,James literally has two tickets to the gun show.
00:07:14,00:07:17,"Like, he literally has two tickets to the gun show."
00:07:17,00:07:20,I was in Florida and there was a gun show going on.
00:07:20,00:07:22,"No, I didn't want to go to it, but I wanted the tickets."
00:07:22,00:07:24,So I just lost my ticket.
00:07:24,00:07:25,"I've actually been meaning to ask since you did that,"
00:07:25,00:07:28,what a gun show is and it's gone so long that I just haven't now.
00:07:28,00:07:29,Does everyone else know what a gun show is?
00:07:29,00:07:32,"You just go along and look at guns and, um,"
00:07:32,00:07:33,"I think you should, and you could buy them."
00:07:33,00:07:35,"It's kind of an ""pagent"" for guns, really."
00:07:35,00:07:36,Do you dress them up?
00:07:36,00:07:37,"Yeah, exactly."
00:07:37,00:07:38,Is it like Croft's for guns?
00:07:38,00:07:42,"A little more explosive, if I'm honest."
00:07:42,00:07:45,"And the very thing is, I have a house in Las Vegas."
00:07:45,00:07:48,"And there's kind of an, there's almost like"
00:07:48,00:07:51,"a perpetual gun show going on in that, and there,"
00:07:51,00:07:54,"because like, and it's like this giant warehouse,"
00:07:54,00:07:58,"just full of dealers who are just showing you AR-15s,"
00:07:58,00:08:01,"M-16s, rocket launchers, minis like,"
00:08:01,00:08:05,"and then there's, then they have a range out bags."
00:08:05,00:08:08,"It's like, ""Well, go test fire it before you buy it."""
00:08:08,00:08:10,"You know, it's like a test drive for a car, you know,"
00:08:10,00:08:13,"but you go out bag, ""All right, here we go!"""
00:08:13,00:08:15,"And then it's just, it's very loud, right?"
00:08:15,00:08:17,I'd be so tense all the time.
00:08:17,00:08:19,"Funny thing is, they advertise it."
00:08:19,00:08:21,They advertise for it at the airport.
00:08:21,00:08:23,So you're on the moon and walkway and you're just
00:08:23,00:08:26,"driving and there's this chick with a gun and a bikini,"
00:08:26,00:08:28,"and you're like, ""Hey, that's a place to go."""
00:08:28,00:08:31,I don't think they sell boots.
00:08:31,00:08:32,But I'm sure they're working on it.
00:08:32,00:08:33,Yeah.
00:08:33,00:08:36,"Las Vegas is very much the James's shirt of America,"
00:08:36,00:08:39,because there's a permanent gun show going on at all times.
00:08:39,00:08:40,"Quite, quite."
00:08:40,00:08:42,"Yeah, 24/7."
00:08:42,00:08:43,Lock it in.
00:08:43,00:08:45,Amazing.
00:08:45,00:08:47,This is an amazing thing.
00:08:47,00:08:49,I can't believe I didn't know about big numbers.
00:08:49,00:08:50,Yeah.
00:08:50,00:08:52,So there have been two attempts in human history
00:08:52,00:08:55,"to estimate the number of particles in the universe, I think,"
00:08:55,00:08:58,or two that have two big ones that we know about
00:08:58,00:08:59,that have been written down.
00:08:59,00:09:01,So one of them was by Archimedes.
00:09:01,00:09:05,"So this was over 2,000 years ago."
00:09:05,00:09:07,And he was estimating the number of grains of sand
00:09:07,00:09:08,"in the universe, actually."
00:09:08,00:09:10,But now we know how many particles in a grain of sand.
00:09:10,00:09:12,"Arthur Eddington, 2,000 years later,"
00:09:12,00:09:14,"estimating the number of particles in the universe,"
00:09:14,00:09:16,they came to exactly the same number.
00:09:16,00:09:16,"No, no, really."
00:09:16,00:09:18,Isn't that completely insane?
00:09:18,00:09:20,What's he just kind of copying off of art?
00:09:20,00:09:25,"Why is he published in ancient Greek, Mr. Eddington?"
00:09:25,00:09:26,Yeah.
00:09:26,00:09:27,"Wow, never mind that."
00:09:27,00:09:28,Never mind that.
00:09:28,00:09:31,"A pissed off would you be, though, when you realize"
00:09:31,00:09:33,"you've got the exact same numbers, Archimedes."
00:09:33,00:09:34,Really?
00:09:34,00:09:36,I was five years.
00:09:36,00:09:38,I think you would add an extra couple to the end.
00:09:38,00:09:41,It's like 10 to the power of 72 plus 7.
00:09:41,00:09:44,"So it doesn't look like you copied him, right?"
00:09:44,00:09:45,"Well, there was a thing about Everest."
00:09:45,00:09:47,Because they measured Mount Everest.
00:09:47,00:09:50,And they found it came to a really annoyingly round number.
00:09:50,00:09:51,Is that right?
00:09:51,00:09:51,Do you remember this?
00:09:51,00:09:54,So is it actually not the tallest mountain in the world?
00:09:54,00:09:54,Is it?
00:09:54,00:09:56,Yeah.
00:09:56,00:09:58,You know that-- I don't know if I'd said this on the podcast before--
00:09:58,00:10:00,last year was the first year that no one's
00:10:00,00:10:03,"reached the top Mount Everest in 41 years,"
00:10:03,00:10:04,since it became a popular--
00:10:04,00:10:05,Because all the shoppers went on the street.
00:10:05,00:10:07,"No, it was just the conditions were really bad."
00:10:07,00:10:08,Because there were a few avalanches.
00:10:08,00:10:10,They closed off a couple of routes.
00:10:10,00:10:11,But they didn't close off like the extreme routes.
00:10:11,00:10:13,And the last chance was in December.
00:10:13,00:10:15,Someone got really close and then had to come back down.
00:10:15,00:10:16,It was the first year.
00:10:16,00:10:17,Really?
00:10:17,00:10:17,Yeah.
00:10:17,00:10:20,And it lost an inch last year from the earthquake.
00:10:20,00:10:24,So you think it would have been easier?
00:10:24,00:10:25,"You tell me, Everest lost an inch."
00:10:25,00:10:27,It lost it is quite cold.
00:10:27,00:10:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:29,00:10:31,We know exactly what that feeling is like.
00:10:31,00:10:33,"It's like, it's really chilly."
00:10:33,00:10:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:35,00:10:37,"And OK, I'm not going to climb you tonight."
00:10:37,00:10:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:39,00:10:43,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:10:43,00:10:45,"OK, it's time for fact number two."
00:10:45,00:10:46,And that is Chazinski.
00:10:46,00:10:49,"Yeah, my fact is that Star Trek was almost not commissioned,"
00:10:49,00:10:53,because the pilot was considered too erotic.
00:10:53,00:10:56,"Now, this fact entailed googling the phrase Star Trek erotic,"
00:10:56,00:10:58,which is quite dangerous.
00:10:58,00:11:00,"I see you have a lot of paper there, which--"
00:11:00,00:11:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:02,00:11:03,So what's that?
00:11:03,00:11:06,"Well, so this was a pilot called The Cage."
00:11:06,00:11:07,It was the name of the episode.
00:11:07,00:11:09,It was sent to NBC in 1964.
00:11:09,00:11:11,"And actually, I was very skeptical about how erotic it"
00:11:11,00:11:15,"could really be, because it does sound quite raunchy."
00:11:15,00:11:19,It was the idea of the show was that a planet
00:11:19,00:11:22,let out a call for help to the guys on the spaceship
00:11:22,00:11:23,on the Star Trek spaceship.
00:11:23,00:11:27,And I'm obviously showing how much I know about the Star Trek
00:11:27,00:11:28,spaceship.
00:11:28,00:11:29,The Star Trek.
00:11:29,00:11:31,That was the original plan for the name of the ship.
00:11:31,00:11:32,We'll see.
00:11:32,00:11:34,"And yeah, so they went down to this planet."
00:11:34,00:11:35,"And actually, it was a plan."
00:11:35,00:11:37,And there was a beautiful alien on this planet
00:11:37,00:11:40,to seduce the Star Trek spaceship crew members.
00:11:40,00:11:43,And because she had to have sex with them
00:11:43,00:11:45,"in order to repopulate this planet,"
00:11:45,00:11:47,because it was suffering from population crisis.
00:11:47,00:11:51,"So it was about someone being planted to seduce Captain Kirk,"
00:11:51,00:11:53,who wasn't Captain Kirk at the time.
00:11:53,00:11:54,"No, it was Captain Pike."
00:11:54,00:11:55,It was Captain Pike.
00:11:55,00:11:56,"It was Captain Pike, wasn't it?"
00:11:56,00:11:57,"Yeah, then the Pike was in the--"
00:11:57,00:12:00,"Yeah, well, they brought it back because then they"
00:12:00,00:12:06,were able to use pieces of the original pilot in the episode.
00:12:06,00:12:07,"And I can't remember the name of it,"
00:12:07,00:12:09,but it has to do with--
00:12:09,00:12:11,Spock is on trial.
00:12:11,00:12:13,Captain Pike has been destroyed.
00:12:13,00:12:14,And he's in this chair.
00:12:14,00:12:17,"And Captain Kirk is testifying on his behalf,"
00:12:17,00:12:22,and they keep cutting to footage of the original pilot.
00:12:22,00:12:25,I was kind of a trek--
00:12:25,00:12:28,"I wasn't a trekky, but I used to watch it all the time"
00:12:28,00:12:31,because it was on in repeats.
00:12:31,00:12:33,So I watched it when I was a kid.
00:12:33,00:12:35,And I was just fascinated by it.
00:12:35,00:12:37,"I was like, why does the future look so old?"
00:12:37,00:12:38,Yeah.
00:12:38,00:12:41,"I mean, there's that used future look."
00:12:41,00:12:43,"And then there's like, well, Christ, that's from the seven--"
00:12:43,00:12:45,I read the original plan for Mr. Spock.
00:12:45,00:12:48,"Well, one of the original things for the design of the character"
00:12:48,00:12:50,"was that he was going to not eat anything,"
00:12:50,00:12:54,and that instead he would have a plate in the middle of his stomach
00:12:54,00:12:57,and energy which struck the plate would be his food.
00:12:57,00:12:59,So he just feed off the cosmic radiation hits the plate.
00:12:59,00:13:03,"So he'd be like, um, you know, photosynthesizing."
00:13:03,00:13:03,I suppose so.
00:13:03,00:13:04,So much.
00:13:04,00:13:05,Yeah.
00:13:05,00:13:06,Sounds great.
00:13:06,00:13:07,Something that I did.
00:13:07,00:13:08,James is dream.
00:13:08,00:13:09,Yeah.
00:13:09,00:13:10,I don't have to waste all this time having meals.
00:13:10,00:13:13,"All the other day, Dan was saying to me the other day."
00:13:13,00:13:15,It's so relentless having to eat all the time.
00:13:15,00:13:16,There's three meals a day.
00:13:16,00:13:17,Why don't we don't talk about it more?
00:13:17,00:13:18,It's bullshit.
00:13:18,00:13:22,"Yeah, which is, again, I need to feed this thing again."
00:13:22,00:13:25,"No, we have discussed this, and it's like my greatest joy."
00:13:25,00:13:27,And I can't believe you want to take that away from us.
00:13:27,00:13:28,I love eating.
00:13:28,00:13:29,"Yeah, I love it."
00:13:29,00:13:32,"But sometimes, I'm just like, I just want to day off."
00:13:32,00:13:33,"Right, yeah."
00:13:33,00:13:34,"Day off, immediately."
00:13:34,00:13:37,That's called the 5-2 diet.
00:13:37,00:13:38,Yeah.
00:13:38,00:13:40,"There are products being developed, though, which are--"
00:13:40,00:13:41,I can't remember the name of them.
00:13:41,00:13:44,"But they are basically nutritious mush,"
00:13:44,00:13:46,which really doesn't taste the very much at all.
00:13:46,00:13:51,But it leaves a selling as much as much.
00:13:51,00:13:52,"Oh, wow."
00:13:52,00:13:55,"There is a sea slug that's managed to get genes out of plants,"
00:13:55,00:13:58,"so it can eat like an animal, but it can also"
00:13:58,00:13:59,photosynthesize.
00:13:59,00:14:02,So I would like to get these plant genes into my body
00:14:02,00:14:04,so I can sometimes photosynthesize as well.
00:14:04,00:14:05,Wow.
00:14:05,00:14:07,"So while sunbathing, you're also eating."
00:14:07,00:14:08,"Yeah, basically."
00:14:08,00:14:09,"Well, that is the dream, actually."
00:14:09,00:14:11,Thinking about it now.
00:14:11,00:14:14,It's not my dream.
00:14:14,00:14:14,I hate to sunbathe.
00:14:14,00:14:15,I love to eat.
00:14:15,00:14:17,It sounds awful.
00:14:17,00:14:20,"My favorite thing I found out about Star Trek, generally."
00:14:20,00:14:22,So created by Gene Roddenberry.
00:14:22,00:14:23,And there's a lot of rules.
00:14:23,00:14:26,He wrote this kind of Bible for a Star Trek of what
00:14:26,00:14:27,"would be, if you made an episode."
00:14:27,00:14:29,My favorite one is that he believed
00:14:29,00:14:33,that there was no chest hair in the future.
00:14:33,00:14:36,"Captain Kirk, in all the shots where he's naked,"
00:14:36,00:14:39,they were shaving his chest because there
00:14:39,00:14:41,was no chest hair in the future.
00:14:41,00:14:41,He thought a head.
00:14:41,00:14:43,He thought evolutionaries.
00:14:43,00:14:44,"Oh, so it's not a fashion thing."
00:14:44,00:14:46,"In the future, he's not shaving it every day."
00:14:46,00:14:47,He just doesn't grow it.
00:14:47,00:14:49,He looks like the pinky toe.
00:14:49,00:14:53,"We would just phase that out, because why not?"
00:14:53,00:14:54,What makes sense?
00:14:54,00:14:55,"I mean, do you think about it?"
00:14:55,00:14:58,"Well, then I guess I'm the only one who can really recall it."
00:14:58,00:15:00,But then when the one episode where
00:15:00,00:15:02,everyone goes a little crazy and Sulu's running around
00:15:02,00:15:04,"with the sword, completely, you know, he's got a bald chest."
00:15:04,00:15:05,Right.
00:15:05,00:15:06,Yeah.
00:15:06,00:15:09,"Spock, when he's fighting Kirk on the planet,"
00:15:09,00:15:11,"and they have to fight each other, bald chest."
00:15:11,00:15:13,Or maybe Klingon's just didn't have chest hair.
00:15:13,00:15:14,I'm not sure.
00:15:14,00:15:15,"No, Vulcans."
00:15:15,00:15:16,"Yes, they're right."
00:15:16,00:15:18,"God, what the hell was that?"
00:15:18,00:15:19,You know what?
00:15:19,00:15:20,Not a real face.
00:15:20,00:15:21,"No, I'll walk away from the table now."
00:15:21,00:15:23,I'll come back in a second.
00:15:23,00:15:24,Dan has just saved us a lot of posts.
00:15:24,00:15:26,That's true.
00:15:26,00:15:27,Never had this.
00:15:27,00:15:29,"So far, you are."
00:15:29,00:15:31,"The worst was when we had Daniel Radcliffe on QI,"
00:15:31,00:15:33,and he got the rules to quit it drunk.
00:15:33,00:15:34,No.
00:15:34,00:15:34,"Oh, my God."
00:15:34,00:15:36,How many emails have we had about that?
00:15:36,00:15:39,"Well, maybe that's why Potter won so many matches."
00:15:39,00:15:42,"That's true, the rules."
00:15:42,00:15:43,I'm a maverick.
00:15:43,00:15:46,I'm ready.
00:15:46,00:15:48,"On the Vulcan thing, we have done this in a previous episode,"
00:15:48,00:15:50,"but if you don't know, you might like it."
00:15:50,00:15:53,Which is that he was originally meant to be Martian.
00:15:53,00:15:54,He was meant to be from Mars.
00:15:54,00:15:56,"Oh, when they were writing the scripts"
00:15:56,00:15:58,"and getting everything approved, the people at the studio"
00:15:58,00:16:00,"said, we think you need to change it,"
00:16:00,00:16:02,"because by the time this series goes out,"
00:16:02,00:16:03,"and it's in its second series or something,"
00:16:03,00:16:06,"we will have landed on Mars, and we will see Martians."
00:16:06,00:16:08,And some of that.
00:16:08,00:16:10,"Yeah, and they were like, and that would make your series"
00:16:10,00:16:12,just look ridiculous.
00:16:12,00:16:13,That's.
00:16:13,00:16:16,He also had red skin at first.
00:16:16,00:16:17,"He was supposed to have red skin, Spock."
00:16:17,00:16:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:18,00:16:19,But then it was in black and white a lot of the time
00:16:19,00:16:22,and it turned out it looked like he just painted himself
00:16:22,00:16:23,"black, so he couldn't have red skin."
00:16:23,00:16:24,"Oh, really?"
00:16:24,00:16:26,"But also on skin painting, in that pilot,"
00:16:26,00:16:30,"the seductuous, this woman who's supposed to seduce them all,"
00:16:30,00:16:31,is green.
00:16:31,00:16:34,"And so she had to be painted in thick green paint,"
00:16:34,00:16:36,"and it's quite hard and time-consuming to do that,"
00:16:36,00:16:38,and so that it shows up properly on camera.
00:16:38,00:16:40,They filmed a test thing to see how it would work on camera.
00:16:40,00:16:43,They sent it away to be properly done.
00:16:43,00:16:46,"They got the video back, and she looked normal skin color."
00:16:46,00:16:48,"And they were like, my god, this hasn't worked."
00:16:48,00:16:50,"And so they went through it all again, made it a bit thicker,"
00:16:50,00:16:53,"a bit brighter green, sent the film away"
00:16:53,00:16:56,"to get the video converted, to get the video back,"
00:16:56,00:16:56,got it back again.
00:16:56,00:16:57,"And they were like, what is going on?"
00:16:57,00:17:00,She's still peach colored with a tiny bit of green tinge.
00:17:00,00:17:02,"And it turned out the color technicians,"
00:17:02,00:17:03,when they got the film had gone--
00:17:03,00:17:04,"well, this is obviously an error."
00:17:04,00:17:06,They didn't mean to.
00:17:06,00:17:07,Something's gone wrong too.
00:17:07,00:17:10,"So they stayed up all night every time,"
00:17:10,00:17:12,trying to make her skin color the--
00:17:12,00:17:13,I made it hilarious.
00:17:13,00:17:17,"James, don't we do a thing about how early TV--"
00:17:17,00:17:18,"Oh, early film stars."
00:17:18,00:17:19,Did they wear green makeup?
00:17:19,00:17:22,"Yeah, you got the better on the black and white cameras."
00:17:22,00:17:23,"You know, did that."
00:17:23,00:17:24,Max Factor.
00:17:24,00:17:26,That's where the name Max Factor comes from.
00:17:26,00:17:28,He was like the greatest--
00:17:28,00:17:32,"at the time, he was the greatest film makeup artist."
00:17:32,00:17:36,And as they were starting to go from--
00:17:36,00:17:41,"like silent film to the different types of film and everything,"
00:17:41,00:17:44,"it looked very oily, very--"
00:17:44,00:17:46,just very much like they were just painted with a bunch of--
00:17:46,00:17:47,"Yeah, when they were technical--"
00:17:47,00:17:50,"So yeah, and so he spent--"
00:17:50,00:17:52,I want to say two years developing what
00:17:52,00:17:56,is now widely known as the standard for film makeup.
00:17:56,00:17:59,"And that's why-- after that, he started"
00:17:59,00:18:00,his own cosmetics line.
00:18:00,00:18:02,And that's where Max Factor comes from.
00:18:02,00:18:04,"Oh, that's awesome, that's very cool."
00:18:04,00:18:07,T.S. Eliot used to paint his face a tiny bit green.
00:18:07,00:18:09,And no one really knows why.
00:18:09,00:18:11,So maybe he was just desperately hoping for a film deal.
00:18:11,00:18:14,"No, no, no, no."
00:18:14,00:18:18,Where are they going to bring the wasteland to Hollywood?
00:18:18,00:18:20,"Now, talking about Star Trek, before we move on,"
00:18:20,00:18:22,a lot of people probably don't realize
00:18:22,00:18:26,that one of the first interracial kisses on television
00:18:26,00:18:28,was between Uhura and Kirk.
00:18:28,00:18:29,Yeah.
00:18:29,00:18:31,"And at the time, it was very, very risque."
00:18:31,00:18:35,"And they almost pulled it, because the censors thought"
00:18:35,00:18:37,it would be too inflammatory.
00:18:37,00:18:40,"And honestly, they got a few letters, but other than that--"
00:18:40,00:18:40,"Oh, really?"
00:18:40,00:18:41,"Yeah, because--"
00:18:41,00:18:45,"And I don't know if this is why they were able to pull it off,"
00:18:45,00:18:48,but they were both under the spell of--
00:18:48,00:18:50,"I can't remember what the character's name was,"
00:18:50,00:18:52,but they were basically forced to do it.
00:18:52,00:18:55,And that's how they were able to kind of get it through.
00:18:55,00:18:59,"But yeah, that was the first interracial kiss on television."
00:18:59,00:19:02,"I read that Uhura was going to leave,"
00:19:02,00:19:04,"but then Martin Luther King like talks her out of it,"
00:19:04,00:19:08,"and said, you're a trailblazing African-American woman who--"
00:19:08,00:19:11,"Like, no matter what you think is happening,"
00:19:11,00:19:15,children watching you are seeing a black woman in space
00:19:15,00:19:17,at the time was so radical.
00:19:17,00:19:20,It's one of the things I give credit for Rod and Barry.
00:19:20,00:19:20,He looked so--
00:19:20,00:19:23,"I mean, he was very misogynistic."
00:19:23,00:19:27,But he looked so far past color religion.
00:19:27,00:19:28,He did.
00:19:28,00:19:30,And that was the theme of a lot of Star Trek episodes.
00:19:30,00:19:31,"Really, wasn't it?"
00:19:31,00:19:33,"It was like this strange other alien, which actually"
00:19:33,00:19:34,"isn't that strange, which is not--"
00:19:34,00:19:37,"And it was weird, because a lot of the characters were not"
00:19:37,00:19:40,white in the '60s when that was a radical thing to do.
00:19:40,00:19:42,"Yeah, Mr. Sulu, your hair."
00:19:42,00:19:43,"Yeah, you just even--"
00:19:43,00:19:44,Check off.
00:19:44,00:19:45,Check off.
00:19:45,00:19:45,Check off.
00:19:45,00:19:48,"At the time, right in the middle of the Cold War, yeah."
00:19:48,00:19:50,"Just one last thing on censors, because I was"
00:19:50,00:19:53,reading about the history of censorship on American TV.
00:19:53,00:20:01,"So, in 1931, cows were not permitted in cartoons to have others."
00:20:01,00:20:03,They had to be pictured in a skirt.
00:20:03,00:20:04,"Yeah, in a skirt?"
00:20:04,00:20:05,This is '31.
00:20:05,00:20:06,This is '31.
00:20:06,00:20:07,What happened again later?
00:20:07,00:20:08,"Because I found another source, really"
00:20:08,00:20:10,"a book called America's First Network TV Sensor,"
00:20:10,00:20:13,"which says that in 1958, cartoon cows"
00:20:13,00:20:15,were only permitted wearing skirts.
00:20:15,00:20:19,Was there a specific length of skirt they were allowed to wear?
00:20:19,00:20:20,"Well, they weren't allowed to wear a mini skirt."
00:20:20,00:20:23,"I had to be quite a floral, nice loose flowing number."
00:20:23,00:20:24,"So, you couldn't see their legs."
00:20:24,00:20:25,"Yeah, that's-- where did they put it?"
00:20:25,00:20:28,"I think this is why then they said cows had to stand upright,"
00:20:28,00:20:30,"because they at first had them on four legs,"
00:20:30,00:20:32,"and they had it halfway down their torso,"
00:20:32,00:20:34,and then it touches the ground.
00:20:34,00:20:35,Is that thing off the internet?
00:20:35,00:20:38,The other week about where do you put dogs trousers?
00:20:38,00:20:41,"Like, they go round all four legs, or just the back two legs?"
00:20:41,00:20:42,"No, yeah."
00:20:42,00:20:43,What if a dog wore trousers?
00:20:43,00:20:44,If a dog wore trousers?
00:20:44,00:20:45,"Well, it would wear two pairs of trousers, wouldn't it?"
00:20:45,00:20:48,"Well, you should've told the internet two weeks ago"
00:20:48,00:20:50,because they were all arguing about it.
00:20:50,00:20:52,"Oh, that's amazing, yeah."
00:20:52,00:20:57,"So, then even in 1940, there was a cow called Elsie,"
00:20:57,00:21:01,"the boredom cow, who was a real cow fearing in a live-action film,"
00:21:01,00:21:05,and they said the others should be suggested rather than shown.
00:21:05,00:21:07,We'd rather see the bulge than the air.
00:21:07,00:21:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:09,00:21:11,In my country sometimes.
00:21:11,00:21:13,And it was pretty-- it's pretty weird.
00:21:13,00:21:20,"OK, it's time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:21:20,00:21:24,"OK, my fact this week is that the Swiss city of Lossan"
00:21:24,00:21:27,has banned silent discos for being too loud.
00:21:27,00:21:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:29,00:21:31,They have party animals in Switzerland.
00:21:31,00:21:32,"That's great, isn't it?"
00:21:32,00:21:33,Yeah.
00:21:33,00:21:34,"So, why?"
00:21:34,00:21:36,"They make a lot of noise apparently, because while you've"
00:21:36,00:21:38,"got the headphones on, you're listening to music,"
00:21:38,00:21:40,"and it's supposed to be silent, a lot of people"
00:21:40,00:21:43,"are just singing along, or kind of bouncing around,"
00:21:43,00:21:45,or just shouting at each other.
00:21:45,00:21:46,Really?
00:21:46,00:21:50,"Yeah, at download, they have a special tent,"
00:21:50,00:21:52,specifically designed for silent discos.
00:21:52,00:21:52,OK.
00:21:52,00:21:55,"Now, I was wandering around the grounds one time,"
00:21:55,00:21:57,trying to find one of the tents where my buddies were going
00:21:57,00:22:00,"to play, wandered into the silent disco tent,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,and was assaulted by this--
00:22:02,00:22:05,"I mean, it's an additional contact."
00:22:05,00:22:10,"Like, it's like, there's a screaming stomp in."
00:22:10,00:22:11,It was much louder.
00:22:11,00:22:13,"And then you look around, it's like, these people"
00:22:13,00:22:16,"having fits, what is happening is I get backed out."
00:22:16,00:22:17,I'm not turning my back on them.
00:22:17,00:22:19,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:19,00:22:21,"I mean, but I mean, they've got the lids on."
00:22:21,00:22:23,"You know, you turn around."
00:22:23,00:22:26,"Given it large, I was terrified."
00:22:26,00:22:27,I never went back.
00:22:27,00:22:28,Because I think we're saying that Los Anna's
00:22:28,00:22:29,done the right thing.
00:22:29,00:22:31,They are on the right track.
00:22:31,00:22:33,I like a silent disco.
00:22:33,00:22:34,"You can have the music nice and quiet,"
00:22:34,00:22:38,"and you can wander out, if you can turn it right down."
00:22:38,00:22:40,I love it.
00:22:40,00:22:41,It really suits me.
00:22:41,00:22:43,"Everyone else is rocking out at download,"
00:22:43,00:22:49,and Andy's listening to Radio 4.
00:22:49,00:22:51,And now the shipping forecast.
00:22:51,00:22:53,Woo!
00:22:53,00:22:56,"Dogger, fair bank."
00:22:56,00:22:58,So maybe we're saying this is a sensible thing.
00:22:58,00:22:59,It seems that way.
00:22:59,00:23:01,"Yeah, I wasn't really old-fay with the silent disco,"
00:23:01,00:23:03,"but it seems that, yeah, they're right."
00:23:03,00:23:04,"They're really good, but the thing is, you get people--"
00:23:04,00:23:06,"because often they have two DJs, or even three,"
00:23:06,00:23:07,playing different tunes.
00:23:07,00:23:11,So people are dancing to different rhythms and different beats.
00:23:11,00:23:14,"So people-- I think people care a bit less what they look like,"
00:23:14,00:23:15,whether they're dancing.
00:23:15,00:23:17,You don't get as much kind of posey dancing.
00:23:17,00:23:18,"Yeah, because you could be saying,"
00:23:18,00:23:21,"I'm totally in rhythm, by the way, to what I'm listening to."
00:23:21,00:23:22,You just don't know that.
00:23:22,00:23:24,It's not obvious when you're not dancing in tune.
00:23:24,00:23:25,"Or singing in tune, I guess."
00:23:25,00:23:28,"A lot of them have their eyes closed,"
00:23:28,00:23:30,constantly running into each other.
00:23:30,00:23:32,It's very different tempos.
00:23:32,00:23:36,"So it's like-- honestly, it's like watching CCTV footage"
00:23:36,00:23:40,"of the damned, just outside the gates."
00:23:40,00:23:41,It's getting ready.
00:23:41,00:23:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:43,00:23:45,Do you know where silent disco comes from?
00:23:45,00:23:45,No.
00:23:45,00:23:46,Or when it comes from.
00:23:46,00:23:49,"So this is-- well, the theory online"
00:23:49,00:23:52,is that it dates back to a 1969 Finnish sci-fi film
00:23:52,00:23:54,"called, I'm going to miss a pronounciate, as well."
00:23:54,00:23:58,"Lucien Aia, which means ""Time of Roses,"""
00:23:58,00:23:59,and people all wear headphones to a party.
00:23:59,00:24:03,And that's the first time it was ever seen in popular culture.
00:24:03,00:24:04,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:04,00:24:06,"There were definitely listening to stuff,"
00:24:06,00:24:07,"because sometimes I didn't want to miss,"
00:24:07,00:24:08,"but I put my headphones on in the office,"
00:24:08,00:24:09,so people don't talk to me.
00:24:09,00:24:11,But I'm not actually listening to anything.
00:24:11,00:24:12,That's all right.
00:24:12,00:24:12,Yeah.
00:24:12,00:24:13,What's your advantage now?
00:24:13,00:24:15,"Well, they're doing that."
00:24:15,00:24:16,"They were just like, I'll go to the party,"
00:24:16,00:24:18,"but I'm not speaking to anybody, keeping my headphones on."
00:24:18,00:24:20,"But that's really interesting, because when was--"
00:24:20,00:24:21,So 1969.
00:24:21,00:24:22,And it's set in 2012.
00:24:22,00:24:24,So when was the audio--
00:24:24,00:24:25,"sorry, when were cassettes?"
00:24:25,00:24:26,Audio cassettes invented.
00:24:26,00:24:28,"Oh, '80s?"
00:24:28,00:24:29,"Because what were they, late '70s?"
00:24:29,00:24:31,"Yeah, because it was headphones, even,"
00:24:31,00:24:32,a concept of a thing you take out.
00:24:32,00:24:33,It just held off the ground with it.
00:24:33,00:24:34,"Oh, yeah, absolutely."
00:24:34,00:24:36,"In America, the giant headphones"
00:24:36,00:24:38,have been around for quite a while.
00:24:38,00:24:40,They kind of went hand in hand with the high-five system
00:24:40,00:24:42,that were sold in the early '60s.
00:24:42,00:24:45,"OK, the first ever jukebox was made by Edison."
00:24:45,00:24:47,And he had some kind of music system.
00:24:47,00:24:49,"And there was like stethoscopes that would come down,"
00:24:49,00:24:52,like five different people would kind of put the stethoscopes
00:24:52,00:24:53,next to the ears and listen.
00:24:53,00:24:54,So that's kind of headphones.
00:24:54,00:24:54,Yeah.
00:24:54,00:24:56,And they used to come with a towel that you could clean it
00:24:56,00:24:58,"after, well, before you would use it."
00:24:58,00:24:59,That's fantastic.
00:24:59,00:25:01,"So you wouldn't catch ear diseases, obviously."
00:25:01,00:25:02,It is.
00:25:02,00:25:04,It was famous ear diseases.
00:25:04,00:25:05,"There's a guy called George Foy,"
00:25:05,00:25:08,who lived in New York where it's loud and he had some kids
00:25:08,00:25:09,who were making noise.
00:25:09,00:25:11,And he decided he would go on a quest to find the quietest place
00:25:11,00:25:12,on the planet.
00:25:12,00:25:14,And he's obsessed with finding quiet places.
00:25:14,00:25:17,"But he says, and he's been inside the anechoic chamber"
00:25:17,00:25:18,in Massachusetts.
00:25:18,00:25:19,"Yes, many apples."
00:25:19,00:25:20,Many apples.
00:25:20,00:25:24,And he's clarified that there is no such thing as silence.
00:25:24,00:25:26,And he said he found it really annoying going inside
00:25:26,00:25:27,"this chamber, which didn't drive him mad,"
00:25:27,00:25:29,like it drives other people mad.
00:25:29,00:25:30,But I have read that the longest anyone's ever
00:25:30,00:25:33,spent in an anechoic chamber is 45 minutes.
00:25:33,00:25:33,He beat that?
00:25:33,00:25:34,Did he?
00:25:34,00:25:35,"Yeah, because he was fine with it."
00:25:35,00:25:36,And they actually had to kind of break the door down
00:25:36,00:25:37,to get him out.
00:25:37,00:25:38,Did they?
00:25:38,00:25:39,It's just something great time.
00:25:39,00:25:40,Did they not have a hand door?
00:25:40,00:25:41,To have a door?
00:25:41,00:25:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:44,00:25:44,That's a design for us.
00:25:44,00:25:47,"Oh, it's not what you're really sure."
00:25:47,00:25:49,"Well, I've been to an anechoic--"
00:25:49,00:25:50,I've been to a semi anechoic chamber.
00:25:50,00:25:51,"Yeah, I knew."
00:25:51,00:25:52,"Wait, what's a semi one?"
00:25:52,00:25:54,"Well, there's some noise because that's just a defeat."
00:25:54,00:25:54,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:54,00:25:55,I was with you.
00:25:55,00:25:56,"Yeah, you were."
00:25:56,00:25:56,Yeah.
00:25:56,00:25:57,It's the echo.
00:25:57,00:25:58,It's the lack of echo.
00:25:58,00:25:59,So you can make noise.
00:25:59,00:26:02,But it's just it won't bounce back at you.
00:26:02,00:26:04,"And so with this one, there was a flaw, which"
00:26:04,00:26:06,"was just normal, and all the other walls"
00:26:06,00:26:09,were kind of had this special stuff that stopped any echoes.
00:26:09,00:26:10,And did it-- was it weird?
00:26:10,00:26:11,"Yeah, it was really weird."
00:26:11,00:26:12,It was hard.
00:26:12,00:26:12,"Really, really weird."
00:26:12,00:26:13,Yeah.
00:26:13,00:26:16,Do you know the most echoey place in the entire world?
00:26:16,00:26:18,It's this massive oil tank in Scotland.
00:26:18,00:26:20,It's in a place called Inchendown.
00:26:20,00:26:22,And they dug these huge oil tanks
00:26:22,00:26:25,into a hillside during the Second World War
00:26:25,00:26:28,to store millions and millions of gallons of oil
00:26:28,00:26:31,"because they need to fuel ships, which were more"
00:26:31,00:26:32,to the nearest naval base.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"But they didn't want it to be a risk of bombers,"
00:26:35,00:26:36,long-range German bombers.
00:26:36,00:26:37,So they had to dig it into the hill.
00:26:37,00:26:41,The only way to get in is through one of these four tiny pipes.
00:26:41,00:26:43,They're 46 centimeters across.
00:26:43,00:26:44,So it's a squeeze.
00:26:44,00:26:46,"But when you get inside there, they've"
00:26:46,00:26:47,got inside and tested it.
00:26:47,00:26:51,"And the way you test it, by the way, is firing a blank epistol"
00:26:51,00:26:53,loaded with blanks and see how long it takes.
00:26:53,00:26:54,And see how long the echo takes.
00:26:54,00:26:55,Why can't you just say echo?
00:26:55,00:26:56,Right.
00:26:56,00:26:58,It's just a standard way of doing it.
00:26:58,00:27:00,There are more modern ways.
00:27:00,00:27:04,But the echo in this chamber lost 112 seconds.
00:27:04,00:27:05,You're kidding.
00:27:05,00:27:05,Wow.
00:27:05,00:27:06,"Oh, my God."
00:27:06,00:27:07,That's so cool.
00:27:07,00:27:08,We played a place the other night.
00:27:08,00:27:12,It was this hall in Frankfurt in Germany.
00:27:12,00:27:15,"And the delay in there was seven seconds long,"
00:27:15,00:27:17,because it was just so cavernous.
00:27:17,00:27:17,Wow.
00:27:17,00:27:19,"And even when you get people in there,"
00:27:19,00:27:22,"I mean, it's such a battle for us to dial in the sound."
00:27:22,00:27:23,I'm really going to fight that.
00:27:23,00:27:25,Wasn't that unbelievably distracting?
00:27:25,00:27:29,"Well, we bring our own PA system with us."
00:27:29,00:27:31,So we're able to really control that.
00:27:31,00:27:34,"Plus, we have probably one of the best sound"
00:27:34,00:27:35,guys in the business.
00:27:35,00:27:37,He is able to really control that.
00:27:37,00:27:39,And he's spent so many hours.
00:27:39,00:27:43,And so many-- he knows how to really dial it in.
00:27:43,00:27:44,"Yeah, I was pretty intense."
00:27:44,00:27:45,So that was seven seconds.
00:27:45,00:27:46,That was seven seconds.
00:27:46,00:27:48,I can't even count 112.
00:27:48,00:27:49,"I mean, it's incredible."
00:27:49,00:27:52,"I mean, it's just hanging there."
00:27:52,00:27:54,"And I mean, it's something like that."
00:27:54,00:28:00,"The decay rate has to just be in just sick, because it's feeding"
00:28:00,00:28:02,itself.
00:28:02,00:28:06,I'd love to go in there and do some vocals.
00:28:06,00:28:08,I've done vocals at the bottom of a well before.
00:28:08,00:28:09,Really?
00:28:09,00:28:13,"Yeah, I don't really recommend it, because you're wet."
00:28:13,00:28:15,So it was this part of like a plan.
00:28:15,00:28:16,"Well, did you just decide to do it?"
00:28:16,00:28:17,"Yeah, well, we were reporting stuff for slipknot."
00:28:17,00:28:19,And we were recording it out.
00:28:19,00:28:20,"It was when we were doing all of it was gone, which"
00:28:20,00:28:22,was the fourth album.
00:28:22,00:28:25,And we were out at our buddies.
00:28:25,00:28:26,It was a place called Soundform.
00:28:26,00:28:29,"It was basically, he lives there, and he's got a studio there."
00:28:29,00:28:32,So we were doing a lot of experimental stuff.
00:28:32,00:28:34,"You know, just to kind of get away from like the Pro Tools"
00:28:34,00:28:35,plugins and everything like that.
00:28:35,00:28:38,"It's like, let's try and capture something unique."
00:28:38,00:28:41,"So they fished me down the bottom of this well,"
00:28:41,00:28:43,"because you know, they had a proper well down there."
00:28:43,00:28:45,"It was deep, very dark."
00:28:45,00:28:48,"And of course, we waited until the sun had gone down to do it."
00:28:48,00:28:51,"I was like, this was poor planning on our work."
00:28:51,00:28:54,But then we fished a telephone in U87 down.
00:28:54,00:28:59,And I was able to kind of do-- and it was just this kind of spoken
00:28:59,00:29:00,word thing that we were just doing again.
00:29:00,00:29:04,"But the reaction, just picked it up, was really, really cool."
00:29:04,00:29:07,So I loved doing stuff like that.
00:29:07,00:29:08,I'm all about it.
00:29:08,00:29:08,Is it true?
00:29:08,00:29:12,Because it's online this about you that your vocal range is--
00:29:12,00:29:13,"Oh, it's the biggest vocal range?"
00:29:13,00:29:14,What was it?
00:29:14,00:29:15,"No, it's not big."
00:29:15,00:29:18,It's in metal.
00:29:18,00:29:20,"Apparently, I have a pretty good range."
00:29:20,00:29:23,"Five and a half octaves, yeah, octaves."
00:29:23,00:29:26,"But I didn't even know that, to be honest, you know?"
00:29:26,00:29:28,Like I was like--
00:29:28,00:29:30,It was just a good thing about the internet.
00:29:30,00:29:32,"Well, I can't sing that, but I can sing this."
00:29:32,00:29:34,That's really-- that's the end of my gig.
00:29:34,00:29:36,"But so that rate, the high range, the screen,"
00:29:36,00:29:38,"got you into getting a gig on top of you, right?"
00:29:38,00:29:41,"Well, yeah, well, the low grow was really--"
00:29:41,00:29:42,"Right, it was really."
00:29:42,00:29:43,"--what did it, yeah."
00:29:43,00:29:46,"Then the guys who directed it, Daniel Hera,"
00:29:46,00:29:49,"who I just saw last night, came to the gig,"
00:29:49,00:29:51,"they were-- he, like, he had a couple of producers."
00:29:51,00:29:53,"A lot of the people there were, like, huge slipmap fans"
00:29:53,00:29:56,"growing up, and I was like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah."
00:29:56,00:29:59,"And they were like, they-- when we played in Cardiff last year"
00:29:59,00:30:02,"where they filmed, and they took us to the doctor who"
00:30:02,00:30:05,"experienced, so I'm just freaking out, you know?"
00:30:05,00:30:07,"Like, we were there for hours."
00:30:07,00:30:08,"And they were like, we got to go."
00:30:08,00:30:12,"We got to get them, like, but no."
00:30:12,00:30:17,"They took us to BBC Cardiff, or BBC Whale, excuse me."
00:30:17,00:30:19,"And they walked us through some of the sets,"
00:30:19,00:30:21,"and everything, and then they were like,"
00:30:21,00:30:22,so we've got this idea.
00:30:22,00:30:24,"And I'm like, yeah, yeah."
00:30:24,00:30:26,"And I described the Fisher King, who"
00:30:26,00:30:30,was the alien who I provided the screen for.
00:30:30,00:30:35,"And then Peter, and I can't pronounce his last name, Sirif."
00:30:35,00:30:35,There it is.
00:30:35,00:30:36,"There it is, thank you."
00:30:36,00:30:40,"Thank you for that, because I butcher it every time."
00:30:40,00:30:43,He did the spoken voice.
00:30:43,00:30:48,"And I did the growl, so it was kind of a cool mashup."
00:30:48,00:30:49,A duet.
00:30:49,00:30:50,Yeah.
00:30:50,00:30:51,"It's basic, essentially."
00:30:51,00:30:52,Yeah.
00:30:52,00:30:53,"I mean, I let him take the lead."
00:30:53,00:30:55,He's pretty good.
00:30:55,00:30:56,Still.
00:30:56,00:30:58,"But yeah, so I just, I went, I'd screened for about 45 minutes,"
00:30:58,00:31:00,"and they were like, well, you've got plenty."
00:31:00,00:31:01,That's it.
00:31:01,00:31:02,And I went and did the gig.
00:31:02,00:31:05,"We actually only asked for three seconds, but thanks for--"
00:31:05,00:31:08,You've quite overdid it.
00:31:08,00:31:09,Anyone got anything else?
00:31:09,00:31:11,An amusing noise complaint.
00:31:11,00:31:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:31:12,00:31:14,I saw-- so this is a big sign that somebody
00:31:14,00:31:17,left outside someone else's house when that person
00:31:17,00:31:20,had been keeping them up all night with their loud music
00:31:20,00:31:21,and their partying.
00:31:21,00:31:23,"And the sign says, to the people that kept us awake all night"
00:31:23,00:31:29,"by singing on the balcony, 223 AM pinball wizard, 3 out of 10."
00:31:29,00:31:31,Your performance of this would cause
00:31:31,00:31:35,the band more shame than Pete Townsend's liberal attitude.
00:31:35,00:31:41,"315 AM walk this way, the lowest point of the performance."
00:31:41,00:31:43,"I hate this song, 1 out of 10."
00:31:43,00:31:46,But then 820 AM.
00:31:46,00:31:47,"So you know, this has gone on a while."
00:31:47,00:31:50,"Tiny dancer, actually very good, 7 out of 10."
00:31:50,00:31:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:52,00:31:54,"Oh, I think they're a bad critic, because that's"
00:31:54,00:31:58,"very good, 7 out of 10 is a little bit harsh, yeah."
00:31:58,00:32:02,"Yeah, it's harsh."
00:32:02,00:32:04,"All right, time for our final fact of the show."
00:32:04,00:32:06,And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:32:06,00:32:09,My fact this week is that the giant squid's brain
00:32:09,00:32:11,is wrapped around its throat.
00:32:11,00:32:15,"So if it eats anything too large, it risks brain injury."
00:32:15,00:32:17,"It feels like a design flaw, doesn't it?"
00:32:17,00:32:18,It does.
00:32:18,00:32:19,"Oh, good."
00:32:19,00:32:20,"I know, but they've got to do a lot with a little space,"
00:32:20,00:32:22,"because they've got this thing called the mantle,"
00:32:22,00:32:24,"which is basically everything except the tentacles,"
00:32:24,00:32:26,and they have to fit a huge amount of stuff in there.
00:32:26,00:32:30,And so they feed through this sort of the hole
00:32:30,00:32:32,"in the middle of the mantle, and they have a beak,"
00:32:32,00:32:35,and they have all sorts of strange features.
00:32:35,00:32:37,And so their brain is wrapped around their esophagus.
00:32:37,00:32:38,"Yeah, how stressful."
00:32:38,00:32:39,It's crazy.
00:32:39,00:32:40,Every meal.
00:32:40,00:32:41,Every meal.
00:32:41,00:32:44,That would put me off eating if I was going to be brain damage
00:32:44,00:32:45,every time I did.
00:32:45,00:32:47,"I just have to chew, that's all it is."
00:32:47,00:32:48,Yeah.
00:32:48,00:32:49,And there's one of very few things that we know
00:32:49,00:32:51,"about the giant squid, because we know so little."
00:32:51,00:32:52,Yeah.
00:32:52,00:32:52,We don't know how they hunt.
00:32:52,00:32:55,We don't know how many species there are.
00:32:55,00:32:56,There might be-- they think there might be up to eight
00:32:56,00:32:58,different species of giant squid.
00:32:58,00:33:00,"So they've obviously got eight tentacles,"
00:33:00,00:33:03,but then they've got two feeding tentacles as well.
00:33:03,00:33:08,So the feeding tentacles can stretch out to 33 feet.
00:33:08,00:33:09,That's what they found in--
00:33:09,00:33:11,"so imagine you've seen a squid ages away,"
00:33:11,00:33:13,"and you're like, I'm pretty safe here."
00:33:13,00:33:16,You can just lob these two feeding arms and grab you
00:33:16,00:33:20,and bring you back like a big tongue on a lizard.
00:33:20,00:33:22,But they won't be able to swallow you down.
00:33:22,00:33:23,You're way bigger than that.
00:33:23,00:33:26,"I was in my head, as I said that, I was a fish."
00:33:26,00:33:28,"Yeah, yeah, I was picturing myself swimming along,"
00:33:28,00:33:29,"going, oh, I'm safe here."
00:33:29,00:33:30,Eating a mole.
00:33:30,00:33:31,Yeah.
00:33:31,00:33:34,"They aren't-- they are the signs of a bus, aren't they?"
00:33:34,00:33:35,They are enormous.
00:33:35,00:33:37,They're so-- some of them are as long as--
00:33:37,00:33:40,"so basically the maximum length, including the tentacles,"
00:33:40,00:33:41,is 13 meters.
00:33:41,00:33:42,Yeah.
00:33:42,00:33:43,Some of them will be the feeding tentacles.
00:33:43,00:33:45,"But still, that's big."
00:33:45,00:33:46,"That's a cheat, though, I would say,"
00:33:46,00:33:49,"because if you grew like an eyebrow hair really, really long,"
00:33:49,00:33:52,"you could say, wow, I'm actually this length."
00:33:52,00:33:55,Because those are just two little tentacle arms.
00:33:55,00:33:57,You count your legs when you're talking about how tall you are.
00:33:57,00:33:58,"Why no, but that's true."
00:33:58,00:33:59,And you care?
00:33:59,00:34:01,"You count your arms, which are your feeding tentacles."
00:34:01,00:34:02,"Yeah, but if I'm talking about a bus,"
00:34:02,00:34:05,I'm not going to talk about a bus that has two extra poles
00:34:05,00:34:07,"hanging out at the top and going, get on my massive pole."
00:34:07,00:34:12,"Well, which bus are you going to say, get on my massive pole?"
00:34:12,00:34:17,There was footage of that one kind of washing up next to a ship.
00:34:17,00:34:19,I want to say it was fishing just off
00:34:19,00:34:21,like maybe the Alaskan coast.
00:34:21,00:34:24,"But it was quite big, and it was caught in one of the nets,"
00:34:24,00:34:26,and it took them forever to do--
00:34:26,00:34:27,To this entangle?
00:34:27,00:34:29,"Yeah, I mean, it was big."
00:34:29,00:34:31,"I mean, this was a big ship."
00:34:31,00:34:34,"You know, this was one of the crabbing ships."
00:34:34,00:34:37,"And Christ, it was half, like maybe three quarters,"
00:34:37,00:34:38,as long as the ship itself--
00:34:38,00:34:39,Yeah.
00:34:39,00:34:42,"It was like, oh, god."
00:34:42,00:34:46,"Someone called, like, the squid police in Weymouth,"
00:34:46,00:34:48,"I think, the squid police."
00:34:48,00:34:49,Yeah.
00:34:49,00:34:50,It's the official name.
00:34:50,00:34:50,"Yeah, that's what you call it."
00:34:50,00:34:53,It's 9/9/10.
00:34:53,00:34:54,"9/9/10, to call."
00:34:54,00:34:55,To call.
00:34:55,00:34:56,"Oh, well done."
00:34:56,00:34:59,"Someone called the squid police, saying that giant squids"
00:34:59,00:35:00,"washed up on a beach, and it turned out"
00:35:00,00:35:02,"to be a mink whale, which is huge."
00:35:02,00:35:04,So they look like whales when they're dumped on beaches.
00:35:04,00:35:06,"There's at least huge, formless lumps."
00:35:06,00:35:07,They're huge lumps of rain.
00:35:07,00:35:08,Yeah.
00:35:08,00:35:09,"And they have the biggest eyeballs in nature, don't they?"
00:35:09,00:35:10,Yeah.
00:35:10,00:35:12,Gigantic eyeballs.
00:35:12,00:35:15,"So all animals, I think, the eyes evolved one time."
00:35:15,00:35:18,"But I think the squid, I think the eyes,"
00:35:18,00:35:19,"evolved completely separately, even"
00:35:19,00:35:21,though they do exactly the same thing.
00:35:21,00:35:23,So it's like eyeballs have evolved twice
00:35:23,00:35:24,in two different types of animals.
00:35:24,00:35:25,Really?
00:35:25,00:35:26,That's right.
00:35:26,00:35:27,Because of the deaths that they have--
00:35:27,00:35:28,"Yeah, I think that's right."
00:35:28,00:35:29,Probably.
00:35:29,00:35:32,I was looking into why they have these enormous eyes.
00:35:32,00:35:35,And there's a really good paper from 2012
00:35:35,00:35:39,by a team led by Dan Erick Nelson to shout out to him
00:35:39,00:35:41,that is to help them spot sperm whales who are their main predators.
00:35:41,00:35:42,So they've got--
00:35:42,00:35:43,So he did a paper.
00:35:43,00:35:45,"And the question was, why do they have eyes?"
00:35:45,00:35:46,"And the answer was, so they can see things."
00:35:46,00:35:48,"No, no, hang on."
00:35:48,00:35:51,"But why the three times wider than almost any other animal,"
00:35:51,00:35:53,"apart from colossal squid, which is the other kind,"
00:35:53,00:35:55,"anyway, I don't know if I remember that."
00:35:55,00:35:57,So sperm whales are the main things that hunt them.
00:35:57,00:35:59,"And 600 meters down, using an eye that size,"
00:35:59,00:36:02,you could spot 120 meters away a sperm whale.
00:36:02,00:36:04,But sperm whales have got sonar.
00:36:04,00:36:07,So they can identify a giant squid from a long way away.
00:36:07,00:36:10,So it's really just to give them any kind of advantage
00:36:10,00:36:12,and a head start and getting away.
00:36:12,00:36:14,"And lots of sperm whales, when they wash up,"
00:36:14,00:36:16,"well, when they die, they've got scars all over them,"
00:36:16,00:36:18,"which we think are from grappling with squid,"
00:36:18,00:36:19,and they're not always tentable.
00:36:19,00:36:20,"No, it's not what it's from."
00:36:20,00:36:22,I was wondering what it was when I was looking at the pictures
00:36:22,00:36:23,of those ones that washed up.
00:36:23,00:36:25,They've got their scratches all down their backs.
00:36:25,00:36:26,Yeah.
00:36:26,00:36:28,And they think that about three quarters
00:36:28,00:36:30,of everything sperm whales eat is giant squid.
00:36:30,00:36:34,From the number of squid beaks they find in the stomachs
00:36:34,00:36:34,of the whales.
00:36:34,00:36:36,"So that it's a huge, they have these enormous battles"
00:36:36,00:36:38,underwater.
00:36:38,00:36:39,There's probably one happening right now.
00:36:39,00:36:40,Yeah.
00:36:40,00:36:43,Right around the spotlight now.
00:36:43,00:36:44,You know squid ink.
00:36:44,00:36:46,So it's--
00:36:46,00:36:49,"Not personally, but we have mutual friends."
00:36:49,00:36:50,"Yeah, it's a metal band."
00:36:50,00:36:52,You guys are going to have a lot.
00:36:52,00:36:54,"Yeah, they're from Shibuya, Wisconsin."
00:36:54,00:36:57,"Shout out, squid ink."
00:36:57,00:37:00,So they actually do two batches of squid ink
00:37:00,00:37:03,that go out when they're using as a defense system.
00:37:03,00:37:05,So the first batch is kind of pure ink.
00:37:05,00:37:06,It's very inky.
00:37:06,00:37:09,And it's meant to create a blob so they can create a distraction.
00:37:09,00:37:12,The second batch is a more mucusy little bit of ink.
00:37:12,00:37:14,So it's mixed with mucus.
00:37:14,00:37:16,"And the idea is that when they spit this out,"
00:37:16,00:37:20,that they are creating a shape that looks exactly like them.
00:37:20,00:37:22,So it's like a decoy.
00:37:22,00:37:25,It's like this weird squid looking decoy.
00:37:25,00:37:26,So it's like a squid hologram.
00:37:26,00:37:27,Exactly.
00:37:27,00:37:30,And they've got video observation of animals
00:37:30,00:37:33,that were going after the squid then going for this.
00:37:33,00:37:36,"And being like, well, what was the squid?"
00:37:36,00:37:37,And he's off.
00:37:37,00:37:37,That's so cool.
00:37:37,00:37:38,"Yeah, it was nice."
00:37:38,00:37:40,I love that.
00:37:40,00:37:41,"Yeah, that is rare."
00:37:41,00:37:43,That's intelligent.
00:37:43,00:37:46,Male squid have to be quite careful what they do with their sperm.
00:37:46,00:37:49,Because the way they inseminate a lady's squid
00:37:49,00:37:51,"is they deposit these sperm packets,"
00:37:51,00:37:55,these sperm intervals into a little pouch on her body.
00:37:55,00:37:56,But she loves to eat them.
00:37:56,00:37:57,That's really what she likes doing best
00:37:57,00:37:59,"is to get like reach around with her tentacles,"
00:37:59,00:38:01,pick the sperm out and eat it.
00:38:01,00:38:02,So that's obviously a problem for the man
00:38:02,00:38:05,because or the male squid.
00:38:05,00:38:07,Because that means that he doesn't get his offspring out
00:38:07,00:38:09,of her because she's just eaten his potential offspring.
00:38:09,00:38:10,If I am a nickel.
00:38:10,00:38:16,It's all right as miles away.
00:38:16,00:38:17,You can empathize.
00:38:17,00:38:19,There you go.
00:38:19,00:38:23,"So when she eats the sperm that you may have deposited on her,"
00:38:23,00:38:26,it actually helps her to develop her unfertilized egg.
00:38:26,00:38:29,"And so it helps out the next guy, his competitor that comes along."
00:38:29,00:38:32,So you've got to really make sure that so that's why
00:38:32,00:38:34,someone is when you deposit your sperm into a female's pouch.
00:38:34,00:38:36,"They try and get it really, really deeply in"
00:38:36,00:38:38,because so that she can't actually reach around to it
00:38:38,00:38:39,and get it out.
00:38:39,00:38:41,Another species called the coastal squid.
00:38:41,00:38:44,And it's usually the bigger males that are successful
00:38:44,00:38:45,with the females.
00:38:45,00:38:48,But they're also sneaky males or sneaker males.
00:38:48,00:38:49,And they're much smaller.
00:38:49,00:38:52,"But what they do is when the female is about to lay her egg,"
00:38:52,00:38:54,she lays it out of her front.
00:38:54,00:38:56,And they deposit sperm on her face.
00:38:56,00:39:01,"And then when the egg comes out, then it kind of collects their sperm."
00:39:01,00:39:04,And their sperm is much bigger than the other males.
00:39:04,00:39:08,I'm not sure we can safely say anything about it.
00:39:08,00:39:11,I'm back here just biting my sperm.
00:39:11,00:39:15,"For his like, those nickels are really primed up to God."
00:39:15,00:39:18,"Giant squid have penises, but other squid don't."
00:39:18,00:39:22,"Do you think they ever like trick people by saying,"
00:39:22,00:39:24,I have a giant squid penis?
00:39:24,00:39:29,And then it's unclear which bit the giant is referring to.
00:39:29,00:39:30,I like to think they do.
00:39:30,00:39:32,I hope they do.
00:39:32,00:39:34,"So you're saying it's like, sorry."
00:39:34,00:39:40,Are you saying that it's a giant squid penis or a giant squid penis?
00:39:40,00:39:44,It's actually an extremely small giant squid penis.
00:39:44,00:39:51,Of all the giant squid penises I've had to deal with.
00:39:51,00:39:54,"And I'm just saying, there's been quite a few."
00:39:54,00:39:56,Yours is by far the smallest of that.
00:39:56,00:40:01,I was just reminded of that.
00:40:01,00:40:02,Are you saying four candles?
00:40:02,00:40:04,I'm saying four candles.
00:40:04,00:40:05,That was the four candles.
00:40:05,00:40:07,"In an original draft of this catch,"
00:40:07,00:40:10,it was about giant squid pieces.
00:40:10,00:40:12,I've learned so much today.
00:40:12,00:40:13,So happy.
00:40:13,00:40:14,So this is a really gross idea.
00:40:14,00:40:19,So there was a woman in South Korea recently who was eating squid.
00:40:19,00:40:20,So we all eat squid.
00:40:20,00:40:23,We call it Kalamari for reasons I don't understand.
00:40:23,00:40:25,But she was eating some boiled squid in a restaurant.
00:40:25,00:40:28,And she suddenly felt a pain in her tongue.
00:40:28,00:40:30,And it turned out the squid wasn't quite dead.
00:40:30,00:40:31,And it was a male squid.
00:40:31,00:40:34,And it had deposited its sperm packet into her tongue.
00:40:34,00:40:35,So she felt horrible pain in her tongue.
00:40:35,00:40:38,And then felt lots of stuff crawling around inside her tongue
00:40:38,00:40:39,and had to go to hospital.
00:40:39,00:40:42,And they took out a whole bunch of sperm.
00:40:42,00:40:43,And apparently this does happen a bit like there's
00:40:43,00:40:45,been reports in Japan of it happening.
00:40:45,00:40:47,"Oh, that's so fucked up."
00:40:47,00:40:51,No one's never fucking hit that shit again.
00:40:51,00:40:52,Oh my god.
00:40:52,00:40:53,Yeah.
00:40:53,00:40:55,Fuck it.
00:40:55,00:40:57,Oh.
00:40:57,00:40:58,Fuck that.
00:40:58,00:41:00,Fuck that shit.
00:41:00,00:41:02,"Vegetarianism, here you come."
00:41:02,00:41:04,It had to be in the tongue.
00:41:04,00:41:05,Why?
00:41:05,00:41:11,"OK, that's it."
