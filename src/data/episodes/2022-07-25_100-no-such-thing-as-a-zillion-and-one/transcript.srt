00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
 Hi everyone, just before we start this episode,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,080
 wanted to drop in that it's our 100th birthday.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,280
 We have been going for 100 years.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,560
 Time has flown.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,480
 No, it's our 100th episode.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,320
 And so happy birthday to us.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,360
 Thanks so much for sticking with us for our 100 full episodes.

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,000
 And this is just the 100th.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,960
 Where's that 100 to many times?

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,000
 There's no big deals, just a 100.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,280
 Just a 100. Just a 100.

12
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,480
 100. For all the show.

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:32,480

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,720
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,560
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,600
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,120
 I'm sitting here with Andy Murray,

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,400
 Ange Zinski, James Harkin, and a special guest

19
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,480
 making his second appearance as first being as a secret track on our vinyl.

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,240
 It's Stone Sour and Slipknot's frontman Corey Taylor.

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,400
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

23
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,040
 And in no particular order, here we go.

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,400
 Starting with you, Corey.

25
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,360
 Oh, the honors, yes.

26
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,840
 My fact is a million seconds is 11.5 days.

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,680
 A billion seconds is 32 years.

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,880
 So that is bizarre because just basically because of the vast difference,

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,360
 you think that a billion is a bit more than a million.

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,040
 And when we talk about billions and trillions,

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,760
 when you hear about trillion dollar debt or billion dollar debt,

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,160
 you kind of think they're essentially the same thing.

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,600
 And yeah.

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,320
 I know. I know. So I only just found out there's no zillion.

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,160
 I thought that was a thing.

36
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,400
 I know it's a billion, billion, zillion.

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,360
 Not a thing at all.

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,800
 It jumps to, I think there's one in between,

39
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,000
 but there's a Google and then there's a Google Place, is that right?

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
 That's a massive, yeah.

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,960
 Which are quite large.

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,520
 So a Google is one with a hundred zeros and a Googleplex is one with a Google zeros.

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,720
 Because you can't write out a Googleplex because if there are more zeros,

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,800
 then there are atoms in the universe.

45
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,320
 I think so, yeah. That's the problem.

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,760
 That's the problem for me.

47
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,840
 Otherwise, we'd all be doing it.

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,440
 That's why we let the computers do it.

49
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,440
 But so it wasn't at the case that billion in America used to be a different billion, too.

50
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,480
 No, we've half copied America, but half not copied it.

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,960
 So a billion means two different things now.

52
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,280
 So a billion in America is a thousand million.

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,760
 And in the UK, it's generally a thousand million now,

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,760
 but also sometimes it's a million million.

55
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,040
 Since 1974, they officially have the standard

56
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,680
 where we have the American shot billion now.

57
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,120
 I can only apologize.

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,080
 Sorry.

59
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,720
 But it's a lot easier for us all to become billionaires.

60
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,000
 Well, I guess so.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,520
 Yeah, that's why we all are.

62
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,800
 Why are they only billionaires sitting at the street?

63
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,120
 You know how long ago it was a trillion years ago?

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,080
 A trillion years ago.

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,920
 I know exactly how long ago it was a trillion years ago.

66
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,880
 In seconds, please.

67
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,160
 No, do you know how many a trillion seconds ago?

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,200
 How many years ago that was?

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,680
 It's always that a thousand billion.

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,160
 Yes.

71
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,720
 Okay.

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,000
 So it's 31,710 years ago.

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,680
 And that was about the first time humans started eating porridge.

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,360
 Really?

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,760
 Yeah.

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,480
 Oh, it's good.

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,360
 What a big day.

78
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,600
 I wonder what they ate up until that point.

79
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,720
 Yeah, breakfast, nothing.

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,520
 Breakfast, nothing.

81
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,480
 Breakfast, porridge.

82
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,560
 Yes, it's still eating it.

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,040
 Yeah.

84
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,320
 I mean, I'm a billionaire.

85
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,080
 I ate meat, carbs, right off the animal.

86
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,280
 That's probably what they were having before they were having porridge.

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,920
 Breakfast.

88
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,800
 Yeah, well, I'm saying, you know, we've gone, you know, I've gone backwards.

89
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,760
 You know, I'm keeping it real.

90
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,240
 Was there anything else that was going on then?

91
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,360
 Do you know, James?

92
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,840
 Yeah, it was about the same time as the first

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,280
 cave paintings in Europe.

94
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,320
 Corolla.

95
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,400
 I believe Bruce Forsyth was also born.

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,080
 Oh, yeah, I don't know.

97
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,920
 Hey, is the one English joke ahead?

98
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,120
 Yeah, it's a good one, right?

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,040
 Sorry.

100
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,720
 Strong cultural reference.

101
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,920
 So impressive.

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,640
 I know my thing.

103
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,240
 Well, it would be the American version of that

104
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,760
 someone who's like really old.

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
 Of Bruce Forsyth?

106
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,320
 Yeah.

107
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,560
 Maybe, but I don't even know if he's still alive.

108
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,040
 Bob Hope.

109
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,000
 Bob Hope, yeah.

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,280
 Oh, he did, I said.

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
 Yeah, he made it to 100 though.

112
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,760
 Yeah.

113
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,960
 Although it turns out,

114
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,320
 I was reading this thing about Bob Hope

115
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,600
 that he actually lied about his birthday just for a sort of like,

116
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,960
 he just knocked it a year younger.

117
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,200
 Well, he was only like 26.

118
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,160
 No, no, yeah.

119
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,320
 No, so he, I just think just for some kind of reason,

120
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,680
 he knocked it a year back.

121
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,160
 So secretly, he knew he'd hit 100.

122
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,800
 Yeah.

123
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,000
 But he couldn't tell anyone.

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,400
 So then when he hit 100 officially in the country,

125
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,280
 they're like, happy birthday,

126
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,320
 but he would have been over it by then.

127
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,560
 Yeah, well, he's just greedy and whatever.

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,680
 He saw himself in the foot there.

129
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
 He was originally named like Bob Hope.

130
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,640
 Yeah.

131
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,760
 And one of the great things the Buddha could do, apparently,

132
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,120
 according to Buddhist legenders,

133
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,400
 can't really, really high.

134
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,520
 Really high.

135
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,080
 He, well, super high, James, I'll tell you how high.

136
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,440
 A mathematician asked him,

137
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,040
 "What's the highest number you know?"

138
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,960
 And so the Buddha said, "Well, I know this number."

139
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,080
 That's a bit different.

140
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,280
 Yeah.

141
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,480
 He could name it though.

142
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,080
 He's the guy who probably came up with Zillian

143
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,360
 in a panicked moment,

144
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
 but like a Zillian, I can count out two.

145
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,880
 Right before he said, "Good Jillian."

146
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,760
 Yeah.

147
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,600
 And then the mathematician said to Buddha,

148
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,520
 "What about Zillian and what?"

149
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,720
 Yeah.

150
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,360
 Huh?

151
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,920
 In your face, Buddha.

152
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,080
 And on this basis, a great religion was founded.

153
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,920
 There was a really good article in I-09,

154
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,200
 which I love about how we can't even comprehend

155
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,960
 this million billion, these massive numbers thing.

156
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,880
 Humans haven't evolved to comprehend them.

157
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,960
 Like, when we were, you know, 3000 years ago,

158
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
 4000 years ago, we didn't need to think about anything

159
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,040
 except people in our immediate vicinity.

160
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,360
 We didn't have much astronomical knowledge,

161
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,840
 stuff like that.

162
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,200
 So we didn't have all these big numbers.

163
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,600
 So this article that was written by someone called,

164
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
 a mathematician called Spencer Greenberg,

165
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
 is talking about how you can make numbers

166
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,720
 be more manageable or make huge things seem more manageable.

167
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,920
 So like, for instance, the time thing is one.

168
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,400
 So you say you could do this over a certain amount of time.

169
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,080
 Another one is breaking stuff down.

170
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,080
 So if you say the US has $17 trillion of debt,

171
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
 the best thing to do there is actually say

172
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,400
 that's $54,000 of debt per person.

173
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,560
 See, this is the problem because you say,

174
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,800
 how many dollars was it for every person in America?

175
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,000
 54,000.

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
 So I can't picture 300 million people,

177
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,960
 which is about the population of the USA.

178
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,800
 So that's where it all falls down, unfortunately.

179
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,160
 It's a manageable amount of money for an unimaginable amount of money.

180
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,320
 Unfortunately, a lot of Americans can handle 54,000.

181
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,160
 In Germany, after the war,

182
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,400
 they had very bad inflation

183
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,520
 and things started costing, you know, 10,000 marks.

184
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,720
 This is after World War One.

185
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,840
 Yeah, exactly.

186
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,000
 And they had this mental disorder called zero stroke or cypher stroke,

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,640
 where people just kept writing down zeroes all the time

188
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,800
 because they just couldn't deal with these massive numbers.

189
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,680
 Really?

190
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,520
 And you would ask them, how many kids do you have?

191
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,160
 And they'd be like, I've got 10 trillion children,

192
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,120
 or how old are you?

193
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,520
 Seven billion years old or something.

194
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,360
 So interesting.

195
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
 Because they just couldn't deal with these massive numbers.

196
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,320
 Wow.

197
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,000
 In 2009, Zimbabwe printed 100 trillion Zimbabwe and dollar notes.

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,880
 I have one.

199
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,920
 Do you?

200
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,440
 And it's worth like something, like 20 pounds or something.

201
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,680
 Yeah, I think I bought mine for about five.

202
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,720
 Nice, okay.

203
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,760
 You've got it on the cheap.

204
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,520
 James collects these kind of things, though,

205
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,000
 just so he can pull things out of his wallet to impress you.

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,640
 James literally has two tickets to the gun show.

207
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,360
 Like, he literally has two tickets to the gun show.

208
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,080
 I was in Florida and there was a gun show going on.

209
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,160
 No, I didn't want to go to it, but I wanted the tickets.

210
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,000
 So I just lost my ticket.

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,360
 I've actually been meaning to ask since you did that,

212
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,000
 what a gun show is and it's gone so long that I just haven't now.

213
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,760
 Does everyone else know what a gun show is?

214
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,000
 You just go along and look at guns and, um,

215
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,440
 I think you should, and you could buy them.

216
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,920
 It's kind of an "pagent" for guns, really.

217
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,960
 Do you dress them up?

218
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,600
 Yeah, exactly.

219
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,960
 Is it like Croft's for guns?

220
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,160
 A little more explosive, if I'm honest.

221
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,440
 And the very thing is, I have a house in Las Vegas.

222
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,080
 And there's kind of an, there's almost like

223
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,120
 a perpetual gun show going on in that, and there,

224
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,400
 because like, and it's like this giant warehouse,

225
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,240
 just full of dealers who are just showing you AR-15s,

226
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,760
 M-16s, rocket launchers, minis like,

227
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,040
 and then there's, then they have a range out bags.

228
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,000
 It's like, "Well, go test fire it before you buy it."

229
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,720
 You know, it's like a test drive for a car, you know,

230
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,520
 but you go out bag, "All right, here we go!"

231
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
 And then it's just, it's very loud, right?

232
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,360
 I'd be so tense all the time.

233
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,200
 Funny thing is, they advertise it.

234
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,360
 They advertise for it at the airport.

235
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,120
 So you're on the moon and walkway and you're just

236
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,480
 driving and there's this chick with a gun and a bikini,

237
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,320
 and you're like, "Hey, that's a place to go."

238
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,120
 I don't think they sell boots.

239
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,560
 But I'm sure they're working on it.

240
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,520
 Yeah.

241
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,880
 Las Vegas is very much the James's shirt of America,

242
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,520
 because there's a permanent gun show going on at all times.

243
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,640
 Quite, quite.

244
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,720
 Yeah, 24/7.

245
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,600
 Lock it in.

246
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,760
 Amazing.

247
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
 This is an amazing thing.

248
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,920
 I can't believe I didn't know about big numbers.

249
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,160
 Yeah.

250
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,800
 So there have been two attempts in human history

251
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,440
 to estimate the number of particles in the universe, I think,

252
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,480
 or two that have two big ones that we know about

253
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,520
 that have been written down.

254
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,840
 So one of them was by Archimedes.

255
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,520
 So this was over 2,000 years ago.

256
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,280
 And he was estimating the number of grains of sand

257
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,160
 in the universe, actually.

258
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,720
 But now we know how many particles in a grain of sand.

259
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
 Arthur Eddington, 2,000 years later,

260
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
 estimating the number of particles in the universe,

261
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,080
 they came to exactly the same number.

262
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,800
 No, no, really.

263
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,560
 Isn't that completely insane?

264
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
 What's he just kind of copying off of art?

265
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,200
 Why is he published in ancient Greek, Mr. Eddington?

266
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,160
 Yeah.

267
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,360
 Wow, never mind that.

268
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,480
 Never mind that.

269
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,040
 A pissed off would you be, though, when you realize

270
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
 you've got the exact same numbers, Archimedes.

271
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,240
 Really?

272
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,400
 I was five years.

273
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,480
 I think you would add an extra couple to the end.

274
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,840
 It's like 10 to the power of 72 plus 7.

275
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,160
 So it doesn't look like you copied him, right?

276
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,840
 Well, there was a thing about Everest.

277
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,280
 Because they measured Mount Everest.

278
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,640
 And they found it came to a really annoyingly round number.

279
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,280
 Is that right?

280
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,760
 Do you remember this?

281
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,000
 So is it actually not the tallest mountain in the world?

282
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,880
 Is it?

283
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,320
 Yeah.

284
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,640
 You know that-- I don't know if I'd said this on the podcast before--

285
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,480
 last year was the first year that no one's

286
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,280
 reached the top Mount Everest in 41 years,

287
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,080
 since it became a popular--

288
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,680
 Because all the shoppers went on the street.

289
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,680
 No, it was just the conditions were really bad.

290
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,880
 Because there were a few avalanches.

291
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,080
 They closed off a couple of routes.

292
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,680
 But they didn't close off like the extreme routes.

293
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
 And the last chance was in December.

294
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,840
 Someone got really close and then had to come back down.

295
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,960
 It was the first year.

296
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,440
 Really?

297
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,920
 Yeah.

298
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,960
 And it lost an inch last year from the earthquake.

299
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,160
 So you think it would have been easier?

300
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,840
 You tell me, Everest lost an inch.

301
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,360
 It lost it is quite cold.

302
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,320
 [LAUGHTER]

303
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,800
 We know exactly what that feeling is like.

304
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,600
 It's like, it's really chilly.

305
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,680
 [LAUGHTER]

306
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,480
 And OK, I'm not going to climb you tonight.

307
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,840
 [LAUGHTER]

308
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,040
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

309
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,200
 OK, it's time for fact number two.

310
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,880
 And that is Chazinski.

311
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,880
 Yeah, my fact is that Star Trek was almost not commissioned,

312
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,280
 because the pilot was considered too erotic.

313
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,960
 Now, this fact entailed googling the phrase Star Trek erotic,

314
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,640
 which is quite dangerous.

315
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,360
 I see you have a lot of paper there, which--

316
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,720
 [LAUGHTER]

317
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,560
 So what's that?

318
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,080
 Well, so this was a pilot called The Cage.

319
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,240
 It was the name of the episode.

320
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,360
 It was sent to NBC in 1964.

321
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,800
 And actually, I was very skeptical about how erotic it

322
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,520
 could really be, because it does sound quite raunchy.

323
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,640
 It was the idea of the show was that a planet

324
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,080
 let out a call for help to the guys on the spaceship

325
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,880
 on the Star Trek spaceship.

326
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,360
 And I'm obviously showing how much I know about the Star Trek

327
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,200
 spaceship.

328
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
 The Star Trek.

329
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
 That was the original plan for the name of the ship.

330
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,720
 We'll see.

331
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,440
 And yeah, so they went down to this planet.

332
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
 And actually, it was a plan.

333
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,160
 And there was a beautiful alien on this planet

334
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,840
 to seduce the Star Trek spaceship crew members.

335
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,600
 And because she had to have sex with them

336
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,120
 in order to repopulate this planet,

337
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,800
 because it was suffering from population crisis.

338
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,680
 So it was about someone being planted to seduce Captain Kirk,

339
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,120
 who wasn't Captain Kirk at the time.

340
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,280
 No, it was Captain Pike.

341
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,320
 It was Captain Pike.

342
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,520
 It was Captain Pike, wasn't it?

343
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,680
 Yeah, then the Pike was in the--

344
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,320
 Yeah, well, they brought it back because then they

345
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,120
 were able to use pieces of the original pilot in the episode.

346
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,480
 And I can't remember the name of it,

347
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,360
 but it has to do with--

348
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,120
 Spock is on trial.

349
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,320
 Captain Pike has been destroyed.

350
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,840
 And he's in this chair.

351
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,480
 And Captain Kirk is testifying on his behalf,

352
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,960
 and they keep cutting to footage of the original pilot.

353
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,520
 I was kind of a trek--

354
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,880
 I wasn't a trekky, but I used to watch it all the time

355
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,600
 because it was on in repeats.

356
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,400
 So I watched it when I was a kid.

357
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,480
 And I was just fascinated by it.

358
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
 I was like, why does the future look so old?

359
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,280
 Yeah.

360
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,040
 I mean, there's that used future look.

361
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,920
 And then there's like, well, Christ, that's from the seven--

362
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
 I read the original plan for Mr. Spock.

363
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,200
 Well, one of the original things for the design of the character

364
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,480
 was that he was going to not eat anything,

365
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,000
 and that instead he would have a plate in the middle of his stomach

366
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,360
 and energy which struck the plate would be his food.

367
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,960
 So he just feed off the cosmic radiation hits the plate.

368
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,360
 So he'd be like, um, you know, photosynthesizing.

369
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,960
 I suppose so.

370
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,880
 So much.

371
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
 Yeah.

372
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,480
 Sounds great.

373
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,720
 Something that I did.

374
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,560
 James is dream.

375
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,080
 Yeah.

376
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,920
 I don't have to waste all this time having meals.

377
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,320
 All the other day, Dan was saying to me the other day.

378
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,640
 It's so relentless having to eat all the time.

379
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
 There's three meals a day.

380
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,600
 Why don't we don't talk about it more?

381
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
 It's bullshit.

382
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,480
 Yeah, which is, again, I need to feed this thing again.

383
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,800
 No, we have discussed this, and it's like my greatest joy.

384
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,560
 And I can't believe you want to take that away from us.

385
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,560
 I love eating.

386
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,800
 Yeah, I love it.

387
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,040
 But sometimes, I'm just like, I just want to day off.

388
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,240
 Right, yeah.

389
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,640
 Day off, immediately.

390
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,040
 That's called the 5-2 diet.

391
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
 Yeah.

392
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,840
 There are products being developed, though, which are--

393
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,920
 I can't remember the name of them.

394
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,680
 But they are basically nutritious mush,

395
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,920
 which really doesn't taste the very much at all.

396
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,000
 But it leaves a selling as much as much.

397
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,080
 Oh, wow.

398
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,720
 There is a sea slug that's managed to get genes out of plants,

399
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,440
 so it can eat like an animal, but it can also

400
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,880
 photosynthesize.

401
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,680
 So I would like to get these plant genes into my body

402
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,760
 so I can sometimes photosynthesize as well.

403
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,240
 Wow.

404
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,000
 So while sunbathing, you're also eating.

405
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Yeah, basically.

406
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,560
 Well, that is the dream, actually.

407
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,920
 Thinking about it now.

408
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,000
 It's not my dream.

409
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,840
 I hate to sunbathe.

410
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,480
 I love to eat.

411
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,160
 It sounds awful.

412
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,400
 My favorite thing I found out about Star Trek, generally.

413
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,840
 So created by Gene Roddenberry.

414
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,720
 And there's a lot of rules.

415
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,000
 He wrote this kind of Bible for a Star Trek of what

416
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,640
 would be, if you made an episode.

417
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,280
 My favorite one is that he believed

418
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,120
 that there was no chest hair in the future.

419
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,640
 Captain Kirk, in all the shots where he's naked,

420
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,360
 they were shaving his chest because there

421
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,080
 was no chest hair in the future.

422
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,840
 He thought a head.

423
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,040
 He thought evolutionaries.

424
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,680
 Oh, so it's not a fashion thing.

425
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,520
 In the future, he's not shaving it every day.

426
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,720
 He just doesn't grow it.

427
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,280
 He looks like the pinky toe.

428
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,560
 We would just phase that out, because why not?

429
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,240
 What makes sense?

430
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,920
 I mean, do you think about it?

431
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,080
 Well, then I guess I'm the only one who can really recall it.

432
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,160
 But then when the one episode where

433
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,280
 everyone goes a little crazy and Sulu's running around

434
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,920
 with the sword, completely, you know, he's got a bald chest.

435
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,760
 Right.

436
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,720
 Yeah.

437
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,160
 Spock, when he's fighting Kirk on the planet,

438
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,600
 and they have to fight each other, bald chest.

439
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,440
 Or maybe Klingon's just didn't have chest hair.

440
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,120
 I'm not sure.

441
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,920
 No, Vulcans.

442
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,760
 Yes, they're right.

443
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,160
 God, what the hell was that?

444
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,000
 You know what?

445
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,160
 Not a real face.

446
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,920
 No, I'll walk away from the table now.

447
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,040
 I'll come back in a second.

448
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,600
 Dan has just saved us a lot of posts.

449
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
 That's true.

450
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,440
 Never had this.

451
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,040
 So far, you are.

452
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,640
 The worst was when we had Daniel Radcliffe on QI,

453
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,440
 and he got the rules to quit it drunk.

454
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,280
 No.

455
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,760
 Oh, my God.

456
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,720
 How many emails have we had about that?

457
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,280
 Well, maybe that's why Potter won so many matches.

458
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,640
 That's true, the rules.

459
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,800
 I'm a maverick.

460
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,400
 I'm ready.

461
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,680
 On the Vulcan thing, we have done this in a previous episode,

462
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,800
 but if you don't know, you might like it.

463
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,240
 Which is that he was originally meant to be Martian.

464
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,480
 He was meant to be from Mars.

465
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,520
 Oh, when they were writing the scripts

466
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,600
 and getting everything approved, the people at the studio

467
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,160
 said, we think you need to change it,

468
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,600
 because by the time this series goes out,

469
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,920
 and it's in its second series or something,

470
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,960
 we will have landed on Mars, and we will see Martians.

471
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,320
 And some of that.

472
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
 Yeah, and they were like, and that would make your series

473
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,440
 just look ridiculous.

474
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,560
 That's.

475
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,160
 He also had red skin at first.

476
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,960
 He was supposed to have red skin, Spock.

477
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
 Oh, yeah.

478
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
 But then it was in black and white a lot of the time

479
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,080
 and it turned out it looked like he just painted himself

480
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,680
 black, so he couldn't have red skin.

481
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,440
 Oh, really?

482
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,960
 But also on skin painting, in that pilot,

483
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,440
 the seductuous, this woman who's supposed to seduce them all,

484
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,960
 is green.

485
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,080
 And so she had to be painted in thick green paint,

486
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,400
 and it's quite hard and time-consuming to do that,

487
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,200
 and so that it shows up properly on camera.

488
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,800
 They filmed a test thing to see how it would work on camera.

489
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,880
 They sent it away to be properly done.

490
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,640
 They got the video back, and she looked normal skin color.

491
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,440
 And they were like, my god, this hasn't worked.

492
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,520
 And so they went through it all again, made it a bit thicker,

493
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,560
 a bit brighter green, sent the film away

494
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,040
 to get the video converted, to get the video back,

495
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,760
 got it back again.

496
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,680
 And they were like, what is going on?

497
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,560
 She's still peach colored with a tiny bit of green tinge.

498
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,040
 And it turned out the color technicians,

499
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,440
 when they got the film had gone--

500
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,600
 well, this is obviously an error.

501
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,320
 They didn't mean to.

502
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,600
 Something's gone wrong too.

503
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,440
 So they stayed up all night every time,

504
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,440
 trying to make her skin color the--

505
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,800
 I made it hilarious.

506
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,080
 James, don't we do a thing about how early TV--

507
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
 Oh, early film stars.

508
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,400
 Did they wear green makeup?

509
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,080
 Yeah, you got the better on the black and white cameras.

510
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,480
 You know, did that.

511
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,880
 Max Factor.

512
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,920
 That's where the name Max Factor comes from.

513
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,720
 He was like the greatest--

514
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,160
 at the time, he was the greatest film makeup artist.

515
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,120
 And as they were starting to go from--

516
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,640
 like silent film to the different types of film and everything,

517
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,120
 it looked very oily, very--

518
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,720
 just very much like they were just painted with a bunch of--

519
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,960
 Yeah, when they were technical--

520
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,000
 So yeah, and so he spent--

521
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,440
 I want to say two years developing what

522
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,600
 is now widely known as the standard for film makeup.

523
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,160
 And that's why-- after that, he started

524
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,600
 his own cosmetics line.

525
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,560
 And that's where Max Factor comes from.

526
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,440
 Oh, that's awesome, that's very cool.

527
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,720
 T.S. Eliot used to paint his face a tiny bit green.

528
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,360
 And no one really knows why.

529
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,880
 So maybe he was just desperately hoping for a film deal.

530
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,880
 No, no, no, no.

531
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,320
 Where are they going to bring the wasteland to Hollywood?

532
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,920
 Now, talking about Star Trek, before we move on,

533
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,680
 a lot of people probably don't realize

534
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,440
 that one of the first interracial kisses on television

535
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,520
 was between Uhura and Kirk.

536
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,020
 Yeah.

537
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,800
 And at the time, it was very, very risque.

538
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,120
 And they almost pulled it, because the censors thought

539
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,320
 it would be too inflammatory.

540
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,360
 And honestly, they got a few letters, but other than that--

541
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:40,860
 Oh, really?

542
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,880
 Yeah, because--

543
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,840
 And I don't know if this is why they were able to pull it off,

544
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,640
 but they were both under the spell of--

545
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,240
 I can't remember what the character's name was,

546
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,560
 but they were basically forced to do it.

547
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,120
 And that's how they were able to kind of get it through.

548
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,160
 But yeah, that was the first interracial kiss on television.

549
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,040
 I read that Uhura was going to leave,

550
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,480
 but then Martin Luther King like talks her out of it,

551
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,840
 and said, you're a trailblazing African-American woman who--

552
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,560
 Like, no matter what you think is happening,

553
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,440
 children watching you are seeing a black woman in space

554
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,840
 at the time was so radical.

555
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,000
 It's one of the things I give credit for Rod and Barry.

556
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,920
 He looked so--

557
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,320
 I mean, he was very misogynistic.

558
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,320
 But he looked so far past color religion.

559
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,480
 He did.

560
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
 And that was the theme of a lot of Star Trek episodes.

561
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,160
 Really, wasn't it?

562
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,600
 It was like this strange other alien, which actually

563
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,960
 isn't that strange, which is not--

564
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,320
 And it was weird, because a lot of the characters were not

565
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,480
 white in the '60s when that was a radical thing to do.

566
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,320
 Yeah, Mr. Sulu, your hair.

567
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,720
 Yeah, you just even--

568
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
 Check off.

569
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
 Check off.

570
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:45,920
 Check off.

571
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,320
 At the time, right in the middle of the Cold War, yeah.

572
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,360
 Just one last thing on censors, because I was

573
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,960
 reading about the history of censorship on American TV.

574
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:01,040
 So, in 1931, cows were not permitted in cartoons to have others.

575
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,440
 They had to be pictured in a skirt.

576
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,680
 Yeah, in a skirt?

577
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,920
 This is '31.

578
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,680
 This is '31.

579
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,520
 What happened again later?

580
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,960
 Because I found another source, really

581
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
 a book called America's First Network TV Sensor,

582
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,480
 which says that in 1958, cartoon cows

583
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,960
 were only permitted wearing skirts.

584
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,080
 Was there a specific length of skirt they were allowed to wear?

585
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,800
 Well, they weren't allowed to wear a mini skirt.

586
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,440
 I had to be quite a floral, nice loose flowing number.

587
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,960
 So, you couldn't see their legs.

588
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,960
 Yeah, that's-- where did they put it?

589
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,560
 I think this is why then they said cows had to stand upright,

590
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,800
 because they at first had them on four legs,

591
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,920
 and they had it halfway down their torso,

592
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,280
 and then it touches the ground.

593
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,400
 Is that thing off the internet?

594
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,400
 The other week about where do you put dogs trousers?

595
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,440
 Like, they go round all four legs, or just the back two legs?

596
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,040
 No, yeah.

597
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,240
 What if a dog wore trousers?

598
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
 If a dog wore trousers?

599
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,880
 Well, it would wear two pairs of trousers, wouldn't it?

600
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,840
 Well, you should've told the internet two weeks ago

601
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,480
 because they were all arguing about it.

602
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,000
 Oh, that's amazing, yeah.

603
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,080
 So, then even in 1940, there was a cow called Elsie,

604
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,320
 the boredom cow, who was a real cow fearing in a live-action film,

605
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,160
 and they said the others should be suggested rather than shown.

606
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,120
 We'd rather see the bulge than the air.

607
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,800
 [LAUGHTER]

608
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,160
 In my country sometimes.

609
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
 And it was pretty-- it's pretty weird.

610
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:20,680
 OK, it's time for fact number three, and that is James.

611
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,240
 OK, my fact this week is that the Swiss city of Lossan

612
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,160
 has banned silent discos for being too loud.

613
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,440
 [LAUGHTER]

614
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,120
 They have party animals in Switzerland.

615
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,280
 That's great, isn't it?

616
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
 Yeah.

617
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
 So, why?

618
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,680
 They make a lot of noise apparently, because while you've

619
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,440
 got the headphones on, you're listening to music,

620
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,120
 and it's supposed to be silent, a lot of people

621
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,520
 are just singing along, or kind of bouncing around,

622
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,280
 or just shouting at each other.

623
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
 Really?

624
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,160
 Yeah, at download, they have a special tent,

625
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,040
 specifically designed for silent discos.

626
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,640
 OK.

627
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,200
 Now, I was wandering around the grounds one time,

628
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,280
 trying to find one of the tents where my buddies were going

629
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,320
 to play, wandered into the silent disco tent,

630
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,520
 and was assaulted by this--

631
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,040
 I mean, it's an additional contact.

632
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,480
 Like, it's like, there's a screaming stomp in.

633
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,920
 It was much louder.

634
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,240
 And then you look around, it's like, these people

635
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,480
 having fits, what is happening is I get backed out.

636
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,720
 I'm not turning my back on them.

637
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,480
 Oh, yeah.

638
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,360
 I mean, but I mean, they've got the lids on.

639
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,440
 You know, you turn around.

640
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,160
 Given it large, I was terrified.

641
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,040
 I never went back.

642
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,760
 Because I think we're saying that Los Anna's

643
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,480
 done the right thing.

644
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,960
 They are on the right track.

645
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,200
 I like a silent disco.

646
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,920
 You can have the music nice and quiet,

647
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,280
 and you can wander out, if you can turn it right down.

648
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
 I love it.

649
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,880
 It really suits me.

650
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,800
 Everyone else is rocking out at download,

651
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,040
 and Andy's listening to Radio 4.

652
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,720
 And now the shipping forecast.

653
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,040
 Woo!

654
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,360
 Dogger, fair bank.

655
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,120
 So maybe we're saying this is a sensible thing.

656
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,040
 It seems that way.

657
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,640
 Yeah, I wasn't really old-fay with the silent disco,

658
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,000
 but it seems that, yeah, they're right.

659
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,360
 They're really good, but the thing is, you get people--

660
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,800
 because often they have two DJs, or even three,

661
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,520
 playing different tunes.

662
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,160
 So people are dancing to different rhythms and different beats.

663
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,520
 So people-- I think people care a bit less what they look like,

664
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,040
 whether they're dancing.

665
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,360
 You don't get as much kind of posey dancing.

666
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,800
 Yeah, because you could be saying,

667
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,280
 I'm totally in rhythm, by the way, to what I'm listening to.

668
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,200
 You just don't know that.

669
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,080
 It's not obvious when you're not dancing in tune.

670
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,880
 Or singing in tune, I guess.

671
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,160
 A lot of them have their eyes closed,

672
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,200
 constantly running into each other.

673
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,400
 It's very different tempos.

674
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,640
 So it's like-- honestly, it's like watching CCTV footage

675
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,160
 of the damned, just outside the gates.

676
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,320
 It's getting ready.

677
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
 [LAUGHTER]

678
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,280
 Do you know where silent disco comes from?

679
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,560
 No.

680
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,440
 Or when it comes from.

681
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,080
 So this is-- well, the theory online

682
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,720
 is that it dates back to a 1969 Finnish sci-fi film

683
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,920
 called, I'm going to miss a pronounciate, as well.

684
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,160
 Lucien Aia, which means "Time of Roses,"

685
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,880
 and people all wear headphones to a party.

686
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,640
 And that's the first time it was ever seen in popular culture.

687
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

688
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,240
 There were definitely listening to stuff,

689
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,640
 because sometimes I didn't want to miss,

690
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,960
 but I put my headphones on in the office,

691
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,920
 so people don't talk to me.

692
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,520
 But I'm not actually listening to anything.

693
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,280
 That's all right.

694
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,800
 Yeah.

695
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,560
 What's your advantage now?

696
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,000
 Well, they're doing that.

697
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,400
 They were just like, I'll go to the party,

698
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,560
 but I'm not speaking to anybody, keeping my headphones on.

699
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,240
 But that's really interesting, because when was--

700
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,320
 So 1969.

701
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,880
 And it's set in 2012.

702
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,440
 So when was the audio--

703
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,480
 sorry, when were cassettes?

704
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,920
 Audio cassettes invented.

705
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,160
 Oh, '80s?

706
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,640
 Because what were they, late '70s?

707
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,080
 Yeah, because it was headphones, even,

708
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
 a concept of a thing you take out.

709
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,360
 It just held off the ground with it.

710
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,040
 Oh, yeah, absolutely.

711
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,760
 In America, the giant headphones

712
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,200
 have been around for quite a while.

713
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,640
 They kind of went hand in hand with the high-five system

714
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
 that were sold in the early '60s.

715
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,440
 OK, the first ever jukebox was made by Edison.

716
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,400
 And he had some kind of music system.

717
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,560
 And there was like stethoscopes that would come down,

718
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,040
 like five different people would kind of put the stethoscopes

719
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,160
 next to the ears and listen.

720
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,360
 So that's kind of headphones.

721
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:54,880
 Yeah.

722
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,840
 And they used to come with a towel that you could clean it

723
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,560
 after, well, before you would use it.

724
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
 That's fantastic.

725
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,240
 So you wouldn't catch ear diseases, obviously.

726
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,080
 It is.

727
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,280
 It was famous ear diseases.

728
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,560
 There's a guy called George Foy,

729
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,640
 who lived in New York where it's loud and he had some kids

730
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,240
 who were making noise.

731
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,520
 And he decided he would go on a quest to find the quietest place

732
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,040
 on the planet.

733
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,120
 And he's obsessed with finding quiet places.

734
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,040
 But he says, and he's been inside the anechoic chamber

735
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,520
 in Massachusetts.

736
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,760
 Yes, many apples.

737
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,880
 Many apples.

738
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,440
 And he's clarified that there is no such thing as silence.

739
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,080
 And he said he found it really annoying going inside

740
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,840
 this chamber, which didn't drive him mad,

741
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,000
 like it drives other people mad.

742
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,720
 But I have read that the longest anyone's ever

743
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,160
 spent in an anechoic chamber is 45 minutes.

744
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,800
 He beat that?

745
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,320
 Did he?

746
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,360
 Yeah, because he was fine with it.

747
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,920
 And they actually had to kind of break the door down

748
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,680
 to get him out.

749
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,200
 Did they?

750
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
 It's just something great time.

751
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,600
 Did they not have a hand door?

752
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
 To have a door?

753
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,120
 [LAUGHTER]

754
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,920
 That's a design for us.

755
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,760
 Oh, it's not what you're really sure.

756
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,040
 Well, I've been to an anechoic--

757
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,680
 I've been to a semi anechoic chamber.

758
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,200
 Yeah, I knew.

759
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,120
 Wait, what's a semi one?

760
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,240
 Well, there's some noise because that's just a defeat.

761
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,840
 Oh, yeah.

762
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,680
 I was with you.

763
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,200
 Yeah, you were.

764
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,720
 Yeah.

765
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,480
 It's the echo.

766
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,360
 It's the lack of echo.

767
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,800
 So you can make noise.

768
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,040
 But it's just it won't bounce back at you.

769
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,320
 And so with this one, there was a flaw, which

770
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,040
 was just normal, and all the other walls

771
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,760
 were kind of had this special stuff that stopped any echoes.

772
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,640
 And did it-- was it weird?

773
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,600
 Yeah, it was really weird.

774
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,080
 It was hard.

775
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,960
 Really, really weird.

776
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,440
 Yeah.

777
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,360
 Do you know the most echoey place in the entire world?

778
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,920
 It's this massive oil tank in Scotland.

779
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,200
 It's in a place called Inchendown.

780
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,400
 And they dug these huge oil tanks

781
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,480
 into a hillside during the Second World War

782
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,080
 to store millions and millions of gallons of oil

783
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,520
 because they need to fuel ships, which were more

784
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,960
 to the nearest naval base.

785
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,000
 But they didn't want it to be a risk of bombers,

786
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,160
 long-range German bombers.

787
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,640
 So they had to dig it into the hill.

788
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,240
 The only way to get in is through one of these four tiny pipes.

789
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,680
 They're 46 centimeters across.

790
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,920
 So it's a squeeze.

791
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,280
 But when you get inside there, they've

792
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,800
 got inside and tested it.

793
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,080
 And the way you test it, by the way, is firing a blank epistol

794
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,160
 loaded with blanks and see how long it takes.

795
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
 And see how long the echo takes.

796
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,760
 Why can't you just say echo?

797
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,280
 Right.

798
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,800
 It's just a standard way of doing it.

799
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,520
 There are more modern ways.

800
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,480
 But the echo in this chamber lost 112 seconds.

801
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,400
 You're kidding.

802
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:05,920
 Wow.

803
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,760
 Oh, my God.

804
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,280
 That's so cool.

805
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,960
 We played a place the other night.

806
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,240
 It was this hall in Frankfurt in Germany.

807
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,480
 And the delay in there was seven seconds long,

808
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,120
 because it was just so cavernous.

809
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,640
 Wow.

810
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,240
 And even when you get people in there,

811
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,480
 I mean, it's such a battle for us to dial in the sound.

812
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,920
 I'm really going to fight that.

813
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,600
 Wasn't that unbelievably distracting?

814
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,520
 Well, we bring our own PA system with us.

815
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,440
 So we're able to really control that.

816
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,120
 Plus, we have probably one of the best sound

817
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,280
 guys in the business.

818
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,600
 He is able to really control that.

819
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,080
 And he's spent so many hours.

820
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,360
 And so many-- he knows how to really dial it in.

821
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,520
 Yeah, I was pretty intense.

822
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,440
 So that was seven seconds.

823
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,640
 That was seven seconds.

824
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,280
 I can't even count 112.

825
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,760
 I mean, it's incredible.

826
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,360
 I mean, it's just hanging there.

827
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,240
 And I mean, it's something like that.

828
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,200
 The decay rate has to just be in just sick, because it's feeding

829
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,400
 itself.

830
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,480
 I'd love to go in there and do some vocals.

831
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,680
 I've done vocals at the bottom of a well before.

832
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
 Really?

833
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,280
 Yeah, I don't really recommend it, because you're wet.

834
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,040
 So it was this part of like a plan.

835
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,240
 Well, did you just decide to do it?

836
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,320
 Yeah, well, we were reporting stuff for slipknot.

837
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,080
 And we were recording it out.

838
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,720
 It was when we were doing all of it was gone, which

839
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,200
 was the fourth album.

840
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,640
 And we were out at our buddies.

841
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,880
 It was a place called Soundform.

842
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,680
 It was basically, he lives there, and he's got a studio there.

843
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,040
 So we were doing a lot of experimental stuff.

844
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,200
 You know, just to kind of get away from like the Pro Tools

845
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,560
 plugins and everything like that.

846
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,040
 It's like, let's try and capture something unique.

847
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,320
 So they fished me down the bottom of this well,

848
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,880
 because you know, they had a proper well down there.

849
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,720
 It was deep, very dark.

850
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,120
 And of course, we waited until the sun had gone down to do it.

851
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,320
 I was like, this was poor planning on our work.

852
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,840
 But then we fished a telephone in U87 down.

853
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,080
 And I was able to kind of do-- and it was just this kind of spoken

854
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,360
 word thing that we were just doing again.

855
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,960
 But the reaction, just picked it up, was really, really cool.

856
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,120
 So I loved doing stuff like that.

857
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
 I'm all about it.

858
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,840
 Is it true?

859
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,720
 Because it's online this about you that your vocal range is--

860
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,760
 Oh, it's the biggest vocal range?

861
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,160
 What was it?

862
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,520
 No, it's not big.

863
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,880
 It's in metal.

864
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,360
 Apparently, I have a pretty good range.

865
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,960
 Five and a half octaves, yeah, octaves.

866
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,800
 But I didn't even know that, to be honest, you know?

867
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,080
 Like I was like--

868
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,040
 It was just a good thing about the internet.

869
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,400
 Well, I can't sing that, but I can sing this.

870
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,720
 That's really-- that's the end of my gig.

871
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,440
 But so that rate, the high range, the screen,

872
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,840
 got you into getting a gig on top of you, right?

873
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,520
 Well, yeah, well, the low grow was really--

874
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,040
 Right, it was really.

875
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,080
 --what did it, yeah.

876
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,240
 Then the guys who directed it, Daniel Hera,

877
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,680
 who I just saw last night, came to the gig,

878
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,920
 they were-- he, like, he had a couple of producers.

879
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,960
 A lot of the people there were, like, huge slipmap fans

880
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,640
 growing up, and I was like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

881
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,560
 And they were like, they-- when we played in Cardiff last year

882
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,080
 where they filmed, and they took us to the doctor who

883
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,760
 experienced, so I'm just freaking out, you know?

884
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,520
 Like, we were there for hours.

885
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,800
 And they were like, we got to go.

886
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,800
 We got to get them, like, but no.

887
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,560
 They took us to BBC Cardiff, or BBC Whale, excuse me.

888
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,560
 And they walked us through some of the sets,

889
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,240
 and everything, and then they were like,

890
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,840
 so we've got this idea.

891
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,840
 And I'm like, yeah, yeah.

892
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,680
 And I described the Fisher King, who

893
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,640
 was the alien who I provided the screen for.

894
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,000
 And then Peter, and I can't pronounce his last name, Sirif.

895
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,840
 There it is.

896
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,800
 There it is, thank you.

897
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,200
 Thank you for that, because I butcher it every time.

898
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,360
 He did the spoken voice.

899
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,480
 And I did the growl, so it was kind of a cool mashup.

900
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
 A duet.

901
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
 Yeah.

902
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
 It's basic, essentially.

903
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
 Yeah.

904
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
 I mean, I let him take the lead.

905
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,480
 He's pretty good.

906
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
 Still.

907
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,720
 But yeah, so I just, I went, I'd screened for about 45 minutes,

908
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,760
 and they were like, well, you've got plenty.

909
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
 That's it.

910
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
 And I went and did the gig.

911
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,560
 We actually only asked for three seconds, but thanks for--

912
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,960
 You've quite overdid it.

913
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,880
 Anyone got anything else?

914
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,200
 An amusing noise complaint.

915
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,040
 Oh, yeah.

916
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,640
 I saw-- so this is a big sign that somebody

917
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,920
 left outside someone else's house when that person

918
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,080
 had been keeping them up all night with their loud music

919
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,160
 and their partying.

920
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,840
 And the sign says, to the people that kept us awake all night

921
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,560
 by singing on the balcony, 223 AM pinball wizard, 3 out of 10.

922
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,120
 Your performance of this would cause

923
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,760
 the band more shame than Pete Townsend's liberal attitude.

924
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,000
 315 AM walk this way, the lowest point of the performance.

925
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,760
 I hate this song, 1 out of 10.

926
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,000
 But then 820 AM.

927
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,520
 So you know, this has gone on a while.

928
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,000
 Tiny dancer, actually very good, 7 out of 10.

929
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,160
 [LAUGHTER]

930
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,720
 Oh, I think they're a bad critic, because that's

931
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,840
 very good, 7 out of 10 is a little bit harsh, yeah.

932
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,280
 Yeah, it's harsh.

933
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,640
 All right, time for our final fact of the show.

934
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,680
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

935
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,440
 My fact this week is that the giant squid's brain

936
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,160
 is wrapped around its throat.

937
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,480
 So if it eats anything too large, it risks brain injury.

938
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,160
 It feels like a design flaw, doesn't it?

939
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
 It does.

940
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
 Oh, good.

941
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,760
 I know, but they've got to do a lot with a little space,

942
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,280
 because they've got this thing called the mantle,

943
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,760
 which is basically everything except the tentacles,

944
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,560
 and they have to fit a huge amount of stuff in there.

945
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,000
 And so they feed through this sort of the hole

946
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,680
 in the middle of the mantle, and they have a beak,

947
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,280
 and they have all sorts of strange features.

948
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,480
 And so their brain is wrapped around their esophagus.

949
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,400
 Yeah, how stressful.

950
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
 It's crazy.

951
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,560
 Every meal.

952
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,600
 Every meal.

953
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,400
 That would put me off eating if I was going to be brain damage

954
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
 every time I did.

955
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,480
 I just have to chew, that's all it is.

956
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,000
 Yeah.

957
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,440
 And there's one of very few things that we know

958
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,720
 about the giant squid, because we know so little.

959
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,240
 Yeah.

960
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,920
 We don't know how they hunt.

961
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,160
 We don't know how many species there are.

962
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,640
 There might be-- they think there might be up to eight

963
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,280
 different species of giant squid.

964
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,360
 So they've obviously got eight tentacles,

965
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,280
 but then they've got two feeding tentacles as well.

966
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,560
 So the feeding tentacles can stretch out to 33 feet.

967
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,520
 That's what they found in--

968
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,840
 so imagine you've seen a squid ages away,

969
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,360
 and you're like, I'm pretty safe here.

970
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,800
 You can just lob these two feeding arms and grab you

971
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,040
 and bring you back like a big tongue on a lizard.

972
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
 But they won't be able to swallow you down.

973
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,680
 You're way bigger than that.

974
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,880
 I was in my head, as I said that, I was a fish.

975
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,600
 Yeah, yeah, I was picturing myself swimming along,

976
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,880
 going, oh, I'm safe here.

977
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,840
 Eating a mole.

978
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
 Yeah.

979
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,320
 They aren't-- they are the signs of a bus, aren't they?

980
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,520
 They are enormous.

981
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,960
 They're so-- some of them are as long as--

982
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,520
 so basically the maximum length, including the tentacles,

983
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,800
 is 13 meters.

984
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,320
 Yeah.

985
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,760
 Some of them will be the feeding tentacles.

986
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,760
 But still, that's big.

987
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,800
 That's a cheat, though, I would say,

988
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,920
 because if you grew like an eyebrow hair really, really long,

989
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,160
 you could say, wow, I'm actually this length.

990
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,040
 Because those are just two little tentacle arms.

991
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,400
 You count your legs when you're talking about how tall you are.

992
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,680
 Why no, but that's true.

993
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,440
 And you care?

994
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,120
 You count your arms, which are your feeding tentacles.

995
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,720
 Yeah, but if I'm talking about a bus,

996
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,360
 I'm not going to talk about a bus that has two extra poles

997
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,400
 hanging out at the top and going, get on my massive pole.

998
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:12,000
 Well, which bus are you going to say, get on my massive pole?

999
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,720
 There was footage of that one kind of washing up next to a ship.

1000
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,440
 I want to say it was fishing just off

1001
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,960
 like maybe the Alaskan coast.

1002
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,800
 But it was quite big, and it was caught in one of the nets,

1003
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,560
 and it took them forever to do--

1004
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,480
 To this entangle?

1005
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,400
 Yeah, I mean, it was big.

1006
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,840
 I mean, this was a big ship.

1007
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,680
 You know, this was one of the crabbing ships.

1008
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,520
 And Christ, it was half, like maybe three quarters,

1009
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,760
 as long as the ship itself--

1010
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
 Yeah.

1011
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,720
 It was like, oh, god.

1012
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,040
 Someone called, like, the squid police in Weymouth,

1013
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,080
 I think, the squid police.

1014
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
 Yeah.

1015
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,080
 It's the official name.

1016
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,960
 Yeah, that's what you call it.

1017
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,040
 It's 9/9/10.

1018
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
 9/9/10, to call.

1019
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,080
 To call.

1020
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,640
 Oh, well done.

1021
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,280
 Someone called the squid police, saying that giant squids

1022
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,440
 washed up on a beach, and it turned out

1023
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,200
 to be a mink whale, which is huge.

1024
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,800
 So they look like whales when they're dumped on beaches.

1025
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,160
 There's at least huge, formless lumps.

1026
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,320
 They're huge lumps of rain.

1027
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,080
 Yeah.

1028
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,880
 And they have the biggest eyeballs in nature, don't they?

1029
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
 Yeah.

1030
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,280
 Gigantic eyeballs.

1031
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,680
 So all animals, I think, the eyes evolved one time.

1032
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,080
 But I think the squid, I think the eyes,

1033
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,600
 evolved completely separately, even

1034
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,520
 though they do exactly the same thing.

1035
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,280
 So it's like eyeballs have evolved twice

1036
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,880
 in two different types of animals.

1037
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
 Really?

1038
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,880
 That's right.

1039
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,880
 Because of the deaths that they have--

1040
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,680
 Yeah, I think that's right.

1041
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,680
 Probably.

1042
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,360
 I was looking into why they have these enormous eyes.

1043
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,320
 And there's a really good paper from 2012

1044
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,080
 by a team led by Dan Erick Nelson to shout out to him

1045
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,920
 that is to help them spot sperm whales who are their main predators.

1046
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,420
 So they've got--

1047
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,680
 So he did a paper.

1048
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,440
 And the question was, why do they have eyes?

1049
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,960
 And the answer was, so they can see things.

1050
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,920
 No, no, hang on.

1051
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,680
 But why the three times wider than almost any other animal,

1052
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,520
 apart from colossal squid, which is the other kind,

1053
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,040
 anyway, I don't know if I remember that.

1054
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,440
 So sperm whales are the main things that hunt them.

1055
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,840
 And 600 meters down, using an eye that size,

1056
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,680
 you could spot 120 meters away a sperm whale.

1057
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,160
 But sperm whales have got sonar.

1058
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,960
 So they can identify a giant squid from a long way away.

1059
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,640
 So it's really just to give them any kind of advantage

1060
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,520
 and a head start and getting away.

1061
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,360
 And lots of sperm whales, when they wash up,

1062
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,560
 well, when they die, they've got scars all over them,

1063
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,960
 which we think are from grappling with squid,

1064
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
 and they're not always tentable.

1065
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,560
 No, it's not what it's from.

1066
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,360
 I was wondering what it was when I was looking at the pictures

1067
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,280
 of those ones that washed up.

1068
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,360
 They've got their scratches all down their backs.

1069
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,360
 Yeah.

1070
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
 And they think that about three quarters

1071
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,920
 of everything sperm whales eat is giant squid.

1072
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,160
 From the number of squid beaks they find in the stomachs

1073
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,680
 of the whales.

1074
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,840
 So that it's a huge, they have these enormous battles

1075
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,160
 underwater.

1076
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,680
 There's probably one happening right now.

1077
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
 Yeah.

1078
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,400
 Right around the spotlight now.

1079
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,960
 You know squid ink.

1080
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,000
 So it's--

1081
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,600
 Not personally, but we have mutual friends.

1082
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,560
 Yeah, it's a metal band.

1083
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,160
 You guys are going to have a lot.

1084
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,680
 Yeah, they're from Shibuya, Wisconsin.

1085
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,040
 Shout out, squid ink.

1086
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,920
 So they actually do two batches of squid ink

1087
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,200
 that go out when they're using as a defense system.

1088
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,360
 So the first batch is kind of pure ink.

1089
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,280
 It's very inky.

1090
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,280
 And it's meant to create a blob so they can create a distraction.

1091
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,920
 The second batch is a more mucusy little bit of ink.

1092
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,080
 So it's mixed with mucus.

1093
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,840
 And the idea is that when they spit this out,

1094
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,600
 that they are creating a shape that looks exactly like them.

1095
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,240
 So it's like a decoy.

1096
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,240
 It's like this weird squid looking decoy.

1097
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,960
 So it's like a squid hologram.

1098
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,800
 Exactly.

1099
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,920
 And they've got video observation of animals

1100
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,920
 that were going after the squid then going for this.

1101
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,200
 And being like, well, what was the squid?

1102
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,160
 And he's off.

1103
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,920
 That's so cool.

1104
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,960
 Yeah, it was nice.

1105
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,000
 I love that.

1106
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,600
 Yeah, that is rare.

1107
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,760
 That's intelligent.

1108
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,720
 Male squid have to be quite careful what they do with their sperm.

1109
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,360
 Because the way they inseminate a lady's squid

1110
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,680
 is they deposit these sperm packets,

1111
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,280
 these sperm intervals into a little pouch on her body.

1112
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,440
 But she loves to eat them.

1113
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,840
 That's really what she likes doing best

1114
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840
 is to get like reach around with her tentacles,

1115
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,280
 pick the sperm out and eat it.

1116
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,640
 So that's obviously a problem for the man

1117
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,200
 because or the male squid.

1118
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,720
 Because that means that he doesn't get his offspring out

1119
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,680
 of her because she's just eaten his potential offspring.

1120
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,680
 If I am a nickel.

1121
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:16,480
 It's all right as miles away.

1122
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,800
 You can empathize.

1123
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,080
 There you go.

1124
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,000
 So when she eats the sperm that you may have deposited on her,

1125
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,160
 it actually helps her to develop her unfertilized egg.

1126
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,400
 And so it helps out the next guy, his competitor that comes along.

1127
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,160
 So you've got to really make sure that so that's why

1128
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,760
 someone is when you deposit your sperm into a female's pouch.

1129
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,520
 They try and get it really, really deeply in

1130
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,400
 because so that she can't actually reach around to it

1131
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,800
 and get it out.

1132
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,960
 Another species called the coastal squid.

1133
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,480
 And it's usually the bigger males that are successful

1134
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,360
 with the females.

1135
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,320
 But they're also sneaky males or sneaker males.

1136
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,400
 And they're much smaller.

1137
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,480
 But what they do is when the female is about to lay her egg,

1138
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,400
 she lays it out of her front.

1139
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,960
 And they deposit sperm on her face.

1140
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,160
 And then when the egg comes out, then it kind of collects their sperm.

1141
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,640
 And their sperm is much bigger than the other males.

1142
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,120
 I'm not sure we can safely say anything about it.

1143
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,920
 I'm back here just biting my sperm.

1144
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,560
 For his like, those nickels are really primed up to God.

1145
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,880
 Giant squid have penises, but other squid don't.

1146
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,000
 Do you think they ever like trick people by saying,

1147
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,080
 I have a giant squid penis?

1148
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:29,200
 And then it's unclear which bit the giant is referring to.

1149
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,360
 I like to think they do.

1150
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,440
 I hope they do.

1151
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,400
 So you're saying it's like, sorry.

1152
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,880
 Are you saying that it's a giant squid penis or a giant squid penis?

1153
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,120
 It's actually an extremely small giant squid penis.

1154
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:51,400
 Of all the giant squid penises I've had to deal with.

1155
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,120
 And I'm just saying, there's been quite a few.

1156
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,160
 Yours is by far the smallest of that.

1157
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,120
 I was just reminded of that.

1158
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,840
 Are you saying four candles?

1159
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,800
 I'm saying four candles.

1160
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,920
 That was the four candles.

1161
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,200
 In an original draft of this catch,

1162
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,640
 it was about giant squid pieces.

1163
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,480
 I've learned so much today.

1164
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,440
 So happy.

1165
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,960
 So this is a really gross idea.

1166
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,280
 So there was a woman in South Korea recently who was eating squid.

1167
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
 So we all eat squid.

1168
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,000
 We call it Kalamari for reasons I don't understand.

1169
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,800
 But she was eating some boiled squid in a restaurant.

1170
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,840
 And she suddenly felt a pain in her tongue.

1171
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,680
 And it turned out the squid wasn't quite dead.

1172
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,600
 And it was a male squid.

1173
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,280
 And it had deposited its sperm packet into her tongue.

1174
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,920
 So she felt horrible pain in her tongue.

1175
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,560
 And then felt lots of stuff crawling around inside her tongue

1176
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,840
 and had to go to hospital.

1177
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,200
 And they took out a whole bunch of sperm.

1178
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,720
 And apparently this does happen a bit like there's

1179
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,520
 been reports in Japan of it happening.

1180
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
 Oh, that's so fucked up.

1181
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,200
 No one's never fucking hit that shit again.

1182
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,960
 Oh my god.

1183
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,760
 Yeah.

1184
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,280
 Fuck it.

1185
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,280
 Oh.

1186
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
 Fuck that.

1187
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,960
 Fuck that shit.

1188
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
 Vegetarianism, here you come.

1189
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,640
 It had to be in the tongue.

1190
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
 Why?

1191
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:11,960
 OK, that's it.

1192
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
