 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,200
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,800
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,140
 James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

6
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:39,460
 facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go starting with you Anichezinski.

7
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:45,320
 My fact this week is that the largest diamond ever found in Russia is called the 26th Congress

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,360
 of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, that's its name.

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,760
 That's it's catchy, that's it's catchy, shiny name, it's called this because it was

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,640
 mined in 1980 and the 26th Congress of the Communist Party opened in 1981 in February 1981.

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,200
 So I think the diamond was actually named before the Congress happened so the Congress was

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,940
 this big meeting of all the Soviet delegates, all important.

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,660
 So was it a complete coincidence, did they think oh what should we call our meeting?

14
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,920
 Let's name it after that lovely big diamond we found last year, what was that called?

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,660
 Yeah, it was that, so it quickly had 25 similar conferences.

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,960
 It does not sound like a great party the 26th Congress of the Soviet Union, it sounds pretty

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,920
 grim because the leaders were pretty sclerotic and elderly at that point and it was was

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,520
 a pressure never who was in charge at the time.

19
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,180
 Yeah, and he spoke for five hours didn't he?

20
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,180
 Do you?

21
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,920
 Yeah, he did a five hour opening speech.

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,280
 Another thing I like about this diamond is wow, five hour opening speech, that's sort

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,760
 of Castro level isn't it?

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
 It's Ken Dodd level.

25
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,760
 Ken Dodd lovely, yeah, less entertaining I reckon.

26
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,480
 But yeah so in the Soviet Union they just used to name stuff after really Soviet things

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,760
 in a way that stopped making names kind of nice and attractive and pretty and started making

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,800
 them sound very utilitarian.

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:04,080
 Yeah, and it all started after the October Revolution in 1917, so then they started calling

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:11,360
 babies Soviet things, so in 1924 one baby got called octea brina after the October Revolution

31
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,440
 and then you got you know stalina when Stalin became a thing.

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,640
 They used to make names out of acronyms of all their heroes names, so a really popular name

33
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,560
 was mels which stood for marks, angles, Lenin, Stalin and then actually when Stalin was when

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,040
 the Soviet Union distance itself from Stalin a lot of people dropped the S after so when

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,920
 they got rid of Stalin this up, where the name mel comes from like from the spice girls.

36
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,760
 Yeah, I don't think I think there might be a different origin to our version of mel, yeah.

37
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:49,280
 Mel C, the C actually stands for Communist and Mel B is a Bolshevik, yeah.

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,800
 This back on diamonds very quickly, I was looking down this big Wikipedia list of all the

39
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,160
 biggest diamonds and I saw one that caught my eye called the Jane Seymour diamond and the

40
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,840
 Jane Seymour diamond is a ring which was named after the actress Jane Seymour.

41
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,680
 She was very proud of it and when they were doing it sort of ceremonies she would go and

42
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,840
 put the diamond on and be part of the ceremony to show it.

43
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,040
 She never owned it, she loved the idea of it, but what caught my eye is the fact that they

44
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,960
 are selling it now. So in July 2016 they announced that they were going to sell it and it led me

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,440
 down the road of seeing how interesting it is when you buy an expensive diamond, how it

46
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,200
 gets delivered to you. It's an eight hour luxury experience in buying the ring.

47
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,920
 So it begins with a journey by air by a helicopter, you get chauffeur by Rolls Royce to a private

48
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,080
 luxury cruise and then on the 57th floor of a hotel you've surrounded by hang on, does

49
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,840
 the cruise go to the cruise ship of 57 store. They go to the 57th floor of a hotel.

50
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,760
 They're surrounded by 10,000 roses. They have an 18 course modern Asian menu with diamond

51
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,040
 and crusted chopsticks. I don't really like modern Asians.

52
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:07,080
 Okay, so this is why you didn't go for it. That's why I live with very cheap occasion.

53
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,340
 But to top it off, they present the ring at midnight while fireworks go off in the night sky.

54
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,880
 That's how they're selling this ring. Can you turn it down at that point? Could you

55
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,800
 say actually now that I've seen it? That sounds like such a slice of hot nonsense.

56
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,840
 Yeah, yeah, it really does. So you go on a helicopter ride to a cruise ship which then

57
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,280
 pointlessly goes in a circle so you can go to a hotel. Yeah, go to the hotel first.

58
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,400
 Yeah, I mean, yeah. What, you'd be rubbish at a cruise with you. I won't have a two

59
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,240
 week cruise, but actually I end up back where I started. So I'm not going to bother. We're

60
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,640
 just going to sit in this harbor for three weeks. I save a lot of money on cruises.

61
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,720
 But it's interesting. If you buy these rings and you get them insured, the insurance only

62
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,760
 last for so long. There's a very famous ring called the Burton Taylor ring, which was Richard

63
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,720
 Burton bought for Elizabeth Taylor. It cost 1.1 million. And because of the insurance,

64
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,800
 she was only allowed to wear it 30 days per year that they're willing to insure you for.

65
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,160
 Most times they need security. Yeah, it's really odd when Elizabeth Taylor was delivered

66
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,680
 the ring. So again, the crazy security, she was in Monaco at the time. And three men carrying

67
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,040
 briefcases, one of which carried the ring or went onto the plane at the same time and went

68
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,960
 sort of different seats, different ways. So no one knew which briefcase it was going

69
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,000
 to be in. And when they finally delivered to it, the guy with the briefcase that had the ring

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,760
 in it also had three pairs of stockings that cost 50 cents in America, but was Elizabeth

71
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,320
 Taylor's favorite, but she couldn't get in Monaco. So along with the ring were the

72
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,880
 three stockings. And everyone said she was way more excited by the stockings than she was

73
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,900
 by the ring that eventually arrived. Right. On helicopters and diamonds, this massive

74
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,680
 communist party diamond was found in the Mia mine. And the Mia mine is one of the biggest

75
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,260
 holes in the world. That's not quite kind James. Sure, it's got some of me. It's a bit better

76
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,760
 than Wigan, but it's one of the biggest holes in the world. And Russia has banned helicopters

77
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,380
 from flying over it because they can get sucked in. They can get sucked in? Wow. Yeah.

78
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:08,500
 What sucks them all? Well, a big time and breathing monster. As it inhales. Well, what it is

79
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,500
 is if you dig a hole deep enough, it gets really hot at the bottom because it's the pressure.

80
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,900
 And that heats up the air. And obviously the air at the top because it's in the middle

81
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:23,360
 of Siberia is cold. And so you get this convection current of air and it can cause a vortex.

82
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,500
 And so anything flying over the top of it can get sucked down into the. Wow. Oh, that's

83
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,400
 cool. It's good, doesn't it? Why in birds? It gets sucked down chimneys. Because most chimneys

84
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,500
 are not the biggest hole in the world. I've understood James right. Yeah. It's the depth

85
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,660
 and the difference in heat, although I suppose a fire is quite hot. Hmm. If I'm ever flying

86
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,280
 over that and the helicopter starts to get into trouble, I'll be able to say as we

87
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,280
 call it. This is quite interesting actually what's happening. It's due to a convection thing.

88
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,560
 There may a nine in the 1960s made 20% of all the gems in the world. Wow. Oh, they found

89
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,940
 them there. And when they first dug it, it's in near Euclopska, I think. So it's really

90
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:12,020
 cold in the middle of Siberia and they had permafrost. So it's really icy there. And even

91
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:18,040
 the dynamite wouldn't get through the permafrost because it was so cold. Wow. What?

92
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,680
 There's Wacoel. I have a little more stuff on things being named Oddly in the Soviet Union

93
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:31,000
 and elsewhere. Go. Okay. So loads of people during the French Revolution started changing

94
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 their names as well. Basically, whenever there's a massive political upheaval, people start

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,960
 naming their babies crazy things. So what will you name your baby after? Jeremy Corbyn

96
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:49,320
 I would name him St. Jez. So in 1792, basically, there have been loads of rules up until that

97
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,400
 point on what you could name your babies. And then there was a rule change during the

98
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,040
 revolution which said, no, any citizen can change their name by just making a declaration

99
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,500
 at their local town hall wherever it might be. And there's a list of things that people

100
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,160
 changed their names to and they are wild. So people chose names including Amos Sacrid

101
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,600
 La Patrie La Toie, which means Sacrid love of the native land year three, Morte, Alistair

102
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,400
 Crat, death to aristocrats, which is a cool name. And my favourite is Simon La Liberté

103
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:25,320
 La Morte, which means Simon Liberté La Death. Simon. Yeah. I'll just use Simon. Thanks. Someone

104
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,280
 after the Egyptian Revolution in 2011 called his daughter Facebook. Really? Yeah. Because

105
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,680
 it played a big part in organizing the protests. Yeah, not just because he liked seeing people

106
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,760
 thought he tried it. I would imagine that that person is going to find it hard to get a

107
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,760
 Facebook account. Just on the largest diamond in the world. It's worth covering. It's called

108
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:54,540
 The Golden Jubilee, although it was originally called Unnamed Brown. It's a brown diamond.

109
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,900
 Didn't have a name. It's a brown diamond. Yeah, there's a lot of brown diamonds. What are

110
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,320
 they? They're like diamonds, but they're brown. Yeah. It sounds like a very unpleasant

111
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:10,080
 euphemism. Come back from the bathroom, kind of hobbling. Oh, it's a brown diamond day.

112
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,360
 So are they actually colour brown, or are they just sort of, they like, they murky with

113
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,800
 infection? They're probably murky, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, well, so they actually are brown,

114
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,840
 but they're very beautiful. Yeah. Just for the people at home, Dan is showing us on his

115
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:29,040
 laptop, pictures of brown diamonds. Yes. And that is disgusting. Anyway, when it was found

116
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,680
 in South Africa, this brown diamond got all these blessings. It was blessed by the Buddhist

117
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,780
 Supreme Patriarch of Thailand, visited the Pope, and then it went to an Islamic scholar

118
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:45,280
 to be blessed by him as well. Did they all get to go on the boat trip and then in the helicopter

119
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:51,800
 and it's around about 20,000 roses? Dan, can you check Urban Dictionary? Well, you have

120
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,040
 your laptop. We don't usually use laptops, but can you check Urban Dictionary to see if

121
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,560
 brown diamond is a thing? Yes, sure. Just while Dan's doing that, thought you might like

122
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,160
 to know there was a tradition in England of what's called "Hortatory Names". So it's extreme

123
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,200
 Puritans got names which were designed to encourage you to behave particularly well. So

124
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,000
 one of the men who rebuilt London after the Great Fire was called Nicholas Barben, right?

125
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,280
 But his middle name was, if Christ had not died for the Thou had been damned, that was

126
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,880
 from Sophie Hay, who we know. He was a friend of ours, he's a classical historian. He knows

127
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,280
 a lot about Pompeii, but she also knows about him. He's not an amazing middle name. You hear

128
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,880
 a lot of those. I think one or two of them turn out to be myths or post-Hok things, but

129
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,360
 that one is real, isn't it? It is in Urban Dictionary. Okay, what's it mean? It's just as

130
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,560
 we were saying, basically slang for turd or poo, i.e. my dog has left a minefield of brown

131
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,120
 diamonds in the yard. Okay, now it's just a bit of knowledge. You clocked it. No, no, we're

132
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:07,600
 going to call that knowledge. I'm going to try and unknow it. Okay, it is time for fact number

133
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,160
 two, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that scientists have announced that they

134
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:20,520
 finally know why shoelaces untie themselves. Good old scientists. Do you know in Russia there's

135
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,840
 a joke, because we were talking about Russia before, where you say, according to British scientists

136
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,040
 and then you say something ridiculous, and that's like a meme of jokes in Russia. Yeah,

137
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,520
 because they have this idea that all British scientists do is really ridiculous shoelace-related

138
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:42,760
 studies. Yeah, we haven't helped that already. This is a university researchers at a university

139
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,720
 in California, Berkeley, and they were studying why shoelaces untie themselves. Surprisingly,

140
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,240
 it's been a massive mystery to science for a very long time, so they dedicated their

141
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,440
 time to working that out. And it's interesting. It's all to do with the way that we slam our

142
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,240
 feet to the ground, and it plays with... Well, I didn't think it would be to do with how

143
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:11,480
 we clap our hands. Unless you wear your shoes on your hands. My pick-toki is poking through

144
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:19,880
 my gloves. Yeah, it's all to do with sort of gravity and so on. I don't fully understand

145
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:27,480
 it. Yeah, yeah. One of the things that they're saying is that when you force your foot down,

146
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,320
 you're going, you're going, you're going, you walk. You make it sound like you walk around

147
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,560
 stepping your feet on the ground. You slam your foot down. Like Hagrid. Yeah, look at

148
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:44,560
 it everywhere, like a giant. Yeah, so not Hagrid, sorry. When we're putting our feet down,

149
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,640
 the shoelaces, the tips of the shoelaces that are left exposed are being pulled back up

150
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,520
 as you go down by gravity, almost as if hands are pulling them because of the force that

151
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,720
 we go down. Therefore, it's slowly loosening them and loosening them and it's going to take

152
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,640
 more and more sense. Does that make sense? I might have made that up. Yeah, so the tips are

153
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,760
 still pulling towards the ground when we're lifting our foot up. Yes, is that it? It's actually

154
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,280
 the flick. So the two things that caused that I think in the study said was it's caused

155
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,800
 by a combination of the impact of the shoe on the ground as it hits the ground which deforms

156
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,920
 the knot itself and then the whipping of the laces as you lift your foot back up, pulls

157
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,120
 the laces away from already deformed knot. So does that mean like if you moonwalk everywhere

158
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,720
 then your shoelaces will never come undone. Yeah, that's absolutely true. So they tested

159
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,400
 with people either walking on the spot up and down without any forward motion and shoelaces

160
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,000
 don't come undone and they tested that people were swinging their legs from a chair and shoelaces

161
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,600
 don't come undone. And I just want to say for the record, my shoelaces just don't come

162
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,160
 undone anyway so I don't understand what this whole... Why? Mine come undone all the time.

163
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,720
 Do they really? Mine do sometimes. Yeah. This is a really interesting chat guys. I always

164
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,800
 thought that we should add more personal touches to the podcast. Some people learn a bit

165
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,880
 more about our personalities and now people know that your shoelaces never come undone.

166
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,760
 But the mine sometimes too. Yeah. The Royal Society website described this study and it

167
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,400
 was... I think it has been over-egging in a bit because they said as demonstrated using

168
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,040
 slow motion video footage and a series of experiments, the failure of the knot happens

169
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,120
 in a matter of seconds often without warning and is catastrophic. Wow. It's not the end

170
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,000
 of a cliff or something. That's true. I don't know if this is over-egging it as well,

171
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,720
 but they're saying that the forces that act on the tied shoelace can be greater than those

172
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,280
 felt by humans on the most extreme roller coaster. Yeah. That's what your shoelace is going

173
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,880
 through every time you put your foot down. It's like a mad roller coaster ride. They're

174
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:42,120
 saying 7G, which is seven times the force of gravity. And the biggest, most powerful

175
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,960
 roller coaster is the Tower of Terror in Johannesburg and that's 6.3G. And to put that into some

176
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,080
 kind of context, a space shuttle, someone in that would get 3G. I think so, they know the

177
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:04,040
 stuff like that. Have you ever seen the website Ian's shoelace? Yes. Yes. It is fantastic, isn't

178
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,000
 it? The best shoelace site I would say on the whole internet. Yep, okay. I agree. It's

179
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,360
 a guy called Ian who has set up a site partly just to tell people about his own knot, which

180
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,520
 is called the Ian knot. And he says it's, they securely tied. It's much better than the

181
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,560
 granny knot that almost everybody uses. And he says that there's also a high security

182
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,920
 version of it, which is called Ian's Secure shoelace knot. But he does say on the website,

183
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,600
 note that my Ian knot is quite secure for all normal activities. Wow. Anna, maybe you're

184
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,080
 using Ian's knot. Yeah, I think I am. The knot thing is unbelievable that we've all been

185
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:47,000
 tying our shoelaces wrong. I saw this in a TED talk. You saw an Ian's knot. So we are all

186
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,840
 doing this granny knot on the way or most of us are. And the way you can tell is if you get

187
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,200
 your finger, if you sort of pull the sides of your shoelace part when your shoes are tied

188
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:01,400
 in a bow, then the bow orient itself vertically. So orient itself away from your body. Whereas

189
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,160
 if you've done a good knot and you pull the two sides of your shoelace part, then the

190
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,440
 bow orient itself horizontally. So it orient itself. Does that make sense? Just looking

191
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,600
 at Dan's shoes now. And they have no laces. I'm not that tall either many more.

192
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,480
 Shell of one cliff too many. Well, you should explain that now that you know how to do

193
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,320
 up shoes, which is basically when we do them up usually, you're putting the very first

194
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,600
 cross you make with the laces, the very first one when you're doing our shoes in a bow,

195
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,920
 you're putting the wrong lace over the top. And if you do the other one, then you'll

196
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,680
 find that it orient itself the right way and it's much stronger. So you put the left hand

197
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,680
 lace over the top of the right hand lace and then draw it underneath. I've just redone

198
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,520
 it on myself. And I think because I'm left handed, I've been putting the left one over

199
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,840
 as is recommended. I was just going to say I bet left handed people do it differently.

200
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,440
 You've been doing it right. And they're very secure my laces. Well, no, they do come

201
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,480
 apart. Sometimes I was gone. I've given away too much about myself. I have to say I tried

202
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,480
 this last night and I, what my mind was blown, I would say, I'm so excited. I'm never going

203
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,400
 to do my laces that wrong again. Can I just say on Ian very quickly, his website's

204
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,640
 called Ian's shoelace site. Ian Feigen is his name. It's worth pointing out, he's made

205
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,960
 a whole side about shoelaces and he actually doesn't really overly care about shoelaces.

206
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,160
 He kind of does what we do. He's picked a subject that he wants to mine and find out

207
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,000
 stuff about and just create a place that's the place to go to about the knowledge, the history

208
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,360
 and so on about it. So a huge shout out to him for just doing that. He doesn't

209
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,920
 give a shit about shoelaces. Are you sure he doesn't? He says on his site, I'm really not

210
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,960
 a knotting nut. I'm just a friendly Aussie guy trying to contribute to the internet. He

211
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,160
 has a celebrity section too. Does he? Yeah. What do Taylor Swift, John McEnroe and

212
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,520
 Reese Witherspoon have in common? They all wear shoes. Well, they're all celebrities

213
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,800
 who I believe may be tying granny knots thanks to the telltale sign of crooked shoelace

214
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,360
 bows that run along the shoe instead of across the shoe. Celebrities are human too. So who

215
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,160
 are they? Taylor Swift, John McEnroe. John McEnroe, Reese Witherspoon. So if I'm looking

216
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,920
 for celebrities, they're not going to be the first three that I look for. Taylor Swift might

217
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:08,360
 be, but John McEnroe probably would be down in the thousands. And so basically he's checked

218
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,840
 a lot of celebrities to get down as far as John McEnroe. And yet he doesn't care about shoelaces.

219
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,040
 I think he went straight to John McEnroe because tennis is one of the jobs you'd have where

220
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,200
 you'd really want strong shoelaces. You may have one of your extra grand slams had he been

221
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,600
 tying. And he's probably got a shoe. Like no one else on that list probably has a shoe, but

222
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,920
 he'll have a sponsored shoe. Well, you know, you have, you have shoes as tennis players.

223
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,040
 We do also have shoes. There's other people. No, but I mean like the McEnroe shoe there

224
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,480
 might be. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I'm saying sports people tend to have shoes. Do they?

225
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:47,400
 Yes. Zola Bud didn't. Who? I'm sorry. That's a very niche reference. But she used to run

226
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,200
 without shoes. She's very famous for it. That is a fantastic joke for those who know who Zola

227
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:01,320
 Bud is. Sandy Shaw, is that no? No. She didn't wear shoes. Wait, the second. Yeah. Oh, yeah, she's

228
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,280
 never got shoes in the video clips. What did she build up against? Does that work for you guys?

229
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,080
 Yes. Yes. Okay. We got the reference. Yeah. He didn't get any lucrative sponsorship deals

230
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:19,600
 as he went to Mordor. So on knots. Yeah. Okay. This is so cool. Every single cell in your body

231
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:28,840
 has two meters of DNA in it, right? But according to science, anything longer than about 139 centimeters

232
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,320
 is likely to get tied up in a knot spontaneously, just due to being agitated about 50 percent

233
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,160
 of the time. So how does our DNA not get into this massive tangled ball? And there are loads

234
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,520
 of theories and scientists don't know. It's so cool. So one of the latest theories is that it's

235
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,520
 got these, I'm going to misexplanate, because it's quite complicated, but it's constantly slipping

236
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:53,880
 through these rings like proteins. And basically, it gets bunched up in lengths like carriages

237
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,080
 in a train. So you're interacting a bit with the rest of the length in your carriage, but

238
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,040
 you're not interacting with other lengths of the DNA. Okay. So it gets bunched up into balls

239
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,920
 which kind of run against each other. Basically, it gets bunched up into sections which are

240
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,920
 much less likely to form knots. Okay. Is that like, if you put loads of elastic bands

241
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,300
 in a box or something, they'd all get tangled up with each other maybe, but if you put elastic

242
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,080
 band balls, then they wouldn't get tangled up with each other. I mean, that would be a great

243
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,760
 explanation if it was true. I don't know if it is. Because I really understood that very

244
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,360
 it's true. I don't know if it is. Maybe it is. Okay. Let's go with that. So the idea that

245
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,320
 things get tangled was discovered by Dorian Rayma and Douglas Smith and they won an

246
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,400
 Ignobel Prize for Physics in 2008. And what they did was they put a load of cords in a rotating

247
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:49,720
 box and they did it more than 3,000 times. And they found that almost always it all got

248
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,600
 knotted up. And this is why if you put your headphones in your pocket or if you, you know,

249
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,560
 all that kind of stuff, it always gets tangled, right? Yeah. Basically, their explanation

250
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:05,320
 is if you have a cord, there is only one way that it's not knotted mathematically. The way

251
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,680
 that it's not knotted is nothing is over the top of each other. Whereas there are hundreds

252
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,400
 and thousands of ways that it might be knotted. So it's just much more likely that it'll

253
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,160
 be one of those knotted states and one of the knotted states. But that's a bit loose.

254
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,080
 So they haven't really cracked the mystery of when I wrap Christmas lights up in a perfect

255
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:30,080
 role and put them in a box where they stay motionless for 360 days and then get them out. Why

256
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,080
 are they tangling? Oh, my God, you only have your Christmas lights up for five days a year.

257
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:41,080
 Yeah, or the preparing for Christmas more than a week in advance is bullshit.

258
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:47,280
 Is it more likely that? It's screwed. It's because they take two months to or not. We don't

259
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:54,280
 get them up until the second of January. Maybe it's tiny earthquakes. It's probably

260
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,880
 that. So there's always tiny earthquakes. Yeah, it must be that. But it does depend on

261
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:05,240
 the length of the cable as well. So if a cable is shorter than 46 centimeters. Which I imagine

262
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:15,720
 that is Christmas lights probably are. Put them on a tiny twig of a tree. But if it's shorter

263
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,840
 than 46 centimeters, it will rarely, if ever, get knotted. So all you have to do is buy

264
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,000
 headphone cables, which are shorter than 46 centimeters. And I'm sure that you're constantly

265
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 holding your phone in your face. The shoelaces get at least 12 mentions in the Bible. No, no, no, no, wrong.

266
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,920
 It's true. I got this from Ian's shoelace site and he has a section called shoelaces as

267
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:46,440
 seen in. And he's listed movies where Jesus's shoelaces came undone and low he tied them

268
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:57,680
 in. Well, Genesis, I've got one here. Genesis. What else? And on the eighth day. Can you give

269
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,760
 us any quotes? Yes, so chapter and verse. So Genesis, it's that I would not take a thread

270
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:09,120
 or a shoelace or anything that is yours, lest you should say I have made a room rich.

271
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,880
 Okay, here's that possible support for that. It wasn't earth see the ice man, who was about

272
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,240
 5,500 years ago he lived then. His shoes were done up, weren't they, with kind of leather

273
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,000
 songs, with some very rudimentary laces. So it's not inconceivable. Yeah, here's one from

274
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,280
 American King James Version, John 127. Here it is, who coming after me is preferred before

275
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,720
 me, whose shoelace I am not worthy to unloose. Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah, all right, fine. Wow,

276
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,240
 right. We're buying it. Didn't think that was going to work. See, Ian, he knows his stuff,

277
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,840
 does. Hey, if I say the phrase, I like your shoelaces to you. What is the appropriate response?

278
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:58,760
 Oh, thank you, Ian. May I say, you're not has made all the difference in the world to me?

279
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:06,000
 Is that it? It's not. It is. Thanks. I stole them from the president. Does that ring any bells

280
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,720
 with you? It didn't for me. And I wonder if I'm being sort of internet. Well, it feels to me

281
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,080
 like it's a thing that you might say to prove your spy. So like if you're reading a newspaper

282
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,360
 in a park and someone said, I like your shoelaces, you would say that response. Yeah. And they

283
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:26,840
 would know you were a spy. It's very close. It's what people who use Tumblr say to detect

284
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,160
 that another Tumblr user in the real world. So it's a code that they all know to say. I like

285
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,240
 your shoelaces. Well, you've just spoiled it now. No, because they all know it. Yeah, but now

286
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:43,080
 everyone else knows it. There used to be the Dennis the Menace Fine Club from the Bino used

287
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,320
 to have a secret thing that you would say to people. I was a member of that. Do you remember

288
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,360
 the secret code? No, I don't. I don't know. You weren't a real member. You were one of the

289
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:59,200
 fake members. All your parents had just been doing it for the letter every week from Dennis

290
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,320
 the Menace to you. Do you know Sandra? I'm not going to say what it is. But if anyone ever

291
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,800
 sees me in the street and you used to be a member, then I still know it. See James knows

292
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:16,120
 how to keep a secret down. So you know that extra hole on a shoelace. So you know when you

293
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,320
 often type a shoes. Yeah. And there's kind of a, you get to the top and then there's an extra

294
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,400
 hole kind of just behind that. Often slightly lower, especially walking boots. You get this.

295
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,800
 And so usually I just don't do anything with it. The purpose of it is for preventing blisters.

296
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,440
 So what you do is you tie all your shoelaces up to the top like normal. And then you keep

297
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,480
 your shoelace on the same side and thread it through that next hole to create a loop on

298
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,640
 you do that on both sides. And then you weave the shoelaces on opposite sides through

299
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,800
 the loops you've created. And this tightens it around your ankle and stops you from getting

300
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,560
 blisters. That's great. Yeah. Look up a vid. It's simple and effective. That's what they

301
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,120
 would teach you that when you're in scouts. Would they? Yeah. Good. I'm really giving away

302
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,720
 a lot about my childhood. Yeah. But they never taught me. Did they not? No. No, you weren't

303
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,280
 really a scout. Well, your parents just said you were less of a baton power. Yeah, that's

304
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,760
 right. You're just done. Dennis and the meritorious guy. I'm very proud of you.

305
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:24,720
 Okay, it's time for pack number three. And that is Andy. My fact is that Nelson's ship HMS

306
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,560
 victory nearly didn't get out of the dock it was built in because it was too big. It was

307
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,600
 a classic mistake. They thought we're going to build this fantastic big ship and they built

308
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,440
 it. And the night before the launch, the dockyard foreman looked at it and he thought, I wonder

309
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,240
 if it's too big. And he measured the ship at its widest point and then he measured the dock.

310
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,640
 He found his horror. It was nine and a half inches wider than the dock. So rookie error.

311
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,240
 It's a rookie. I look complete. Amateurism. And so like he told his boss who apparently fell

312
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,080
 into despair. I said, what are we going to do? The ship will get stuck if we try and launch

313
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,080
 it and it'll be massively embarrassing. And then the ship writes in the carpeters who were

314
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,920
 working at the dock just, you know, just wore away at the dock's timbers and removed

315
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:10,320
 bits and they managed to save that crucial, you know, they must have removed about a foot.

316
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,600
 So it got through, but imagine it would have had about a couple of inches on either side.

317
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,720
 Yeah. So exciting. I read that his boss was called John Allen and he was already suffering

318
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,240
 from violence and frequent attacks of a billiest disorder in his bowels. And this could not

319
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:32,840
 have helped his brown diamonds will not have been amused. So, you know, I mean, this was said

320
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,840
 at the time that, uh, eight years of victory nearly didn't make it to the Battle of Trafalgar,

321
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,600
 but it was launched in 1765, 40 years before. So it probably would have caught up.

322
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,840
 Well, it was a long way away, wasn't it, from the location. Where did they build it? New

323
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,200
 Zealand or something and then set off towards the battle 40 years before.

324
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:56,520
 This isn't the only time this has happened. So, um, isn't by Kingdom Brunel built the world's

325
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,560
 first proper big iron ship. It was the first iron steam ship across the Atlantic. It was a massive

326
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,120
 deal. It was a SS Great Britain and it was built to be a passenger service between Bristol and

327
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:12,600
 America, but when he built it, it was in Bristol, Docs in 1844 and it got trapped in the lock gates.

328
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,400
 And I was reading a letter of apology he wrote to a people at a meeting he was supposed to be at

329
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,720
 the next day saying he wasn't able to get there because this huge boat he built had got trapped

330
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,520
 because the lock was too small and he'd been up all night having to dismantle the masonry of the lock

331
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,040
 in order to get it out. And that's Brunel who you would have thought knows what he's doing.

332
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:35,240
 It must be a thing you just forget to check. That last minute exit door bit.

333
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,360
 I could click because it has happened a lot. There's a different one slightly. This could get out

334
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:46,120
 the dock, but have you heard of the Ural? It was called Ural. Yeah, the Ural. It's a famous ship.

335
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,840
 I'd not heard of it before. No, but there's a place called the Ural Mountains.

336
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:56,520
 Oh, okay. All right. So, this was commissioned in 1989 and it was 265 meters long, 36,000 tons.

337
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:03,160
 Basically, it was so large that nowhere was big enough to dock it. So, they had to dock it just off

338
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:09,000
 the harbor and just use it as a place where soldiers and naval officers could just have as a base

339
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,400
 and track things and so on and they've now decommissioned it, but they just couldn't use it. It was too

340
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,680
 big. And it was supposed to be because it became basically a barracks, didn't it? But it was supposed

341
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,480
 to be a huge thing for the Soviet Union. The technology on it was amazing. So, it was powered by

342
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,720
 nuclear reactors. It was huge, like you said. It had the best in electronics and intelligence. It could

343
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,920
 see satellites from out of space. It could see any ballistic missiles that might be coming towards it.

344
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,160
 It was supposed to be an amazing intelligence gathering ship that traveled around the world.

345
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:44,920
 And yet, they just built it too big. So, apron as a victory. This is quite cool. It was the same

346
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:51,080
 age as Nelson, basically. As in when they had the battle, I think he was 48 and the ship was 47.

347
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,520
 So, not the same age. Not the same age. Yeah, all right.

348
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:01,480
 Different news at school. But they wouldn't know each other. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was big sister.

349
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:10,280
 When Nelson was born, was he too large to fit out of the earth? They had to physically dismantle him.

350
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,000
 Oh, God.

351
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,200
 But this is really cool. So, three years before the battle, he went around the forest of

352
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,480
 damage, provided all the wood for the, you know, the Napoleonic Navy. And it was 6,000 trees.

353
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,920
 And he was appalled at what he found, right? Because loads of the forest was unavailable.

354
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,440
 Timber merchants were saying, no, you can't have this bitten. Lots of the rest of it had been kind of

355
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,000
 ruined by charcoal burners. And Nelson said parliament should plant lots of new forests, right?

356
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,120
 And a few years after he died in Trafalgar, they did plant a load of new forests. And two of the

357
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:49,800
 oaks planted during that ship building tree planting drive provided raw material to restore HMS

358
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:55,560
 victory 200 years later. Oh, that is so nice. How cool is that? Yeah, that's very cool. Do you know

359
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,320
 how it got its name? The name victory? Yeah, victory. Was it not named until after the Battle of Trafalgar?

360
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,160
 It was just my name's brown. Was it named in a massive act of hubris?

361
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:13,000
 It was named, they say, potentially, because I think it's not fully known to commemorate the victories

362
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,640
 that were happening in the year of 1759, which were a lot. And they called that year the year of

363
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,760
 miracles, Annas Mirabilis, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, it's the year of miracles.

364
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,520
 But I suspect it was the other thing, because on the article it says, or it may have been chosen

365
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,680
 simply because out of the seven names shortlisted, victory was the only one that was not in use.

366
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:38,680
 Other six were already massive ship names. Yeah. So I reckon the ship's face was already.

367
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:45,800
 The Battle of Trafalgar was obviously very heated. That's some statement. But

368
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:51,160
 Nelson was shot at the height of the battle, and his ship was tangled with a French ship, I think,

369
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,000
 maybe a Spanish one, and there were snipers in the rigging of that ship shooting people on deck.

370
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,160
 But listen to this. So Nelson seemed like he really had a death wish, because he was walking up

371
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:05,080
 and down on deck in spite of that. He was dictating to his secretary who was called Scott at the time.

372
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:14,040
 Scott got blasted in half by a cannonball. So Nelson's assistance quickly pick up his body and

373
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,800
 they throw him overboard. Nelson's response is just to say, "Is that poor Scott?"

374
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,520
 If you get hit by a cannonball, it could literally cut you in half.

375
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,720
 If a cannonball is fired, yeah, I mean that's a huge heavy lump of metal,

376
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,600
 traveling at hundreds of miles an hour. Yeah, I'm not saying that it couldn't kill you,

377
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,840
 but I thought it would splatter you rather than just like literally.

378
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,680
 I think he was in half. Well maybe he was almost cussed too. I don't know.

379
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,680
 It probably wasn't a clean cut. I can't be saying that. It's like a guillotine.

380
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:46,520
 No. So anyway, Scott is no longer available for secretarial duties to put it mildly.

381
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,000
 So then the next person to replace him is called Thomas Whipple. He arrives on deck. Nelson

382
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,600
 probably continues dictating to him. Yeah. Then Whipple dies almost immediately, because a cannonball

383
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,200
 doesn't hit him, but it passes him and it's believed he was killed by the shockwave from...

384
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:09,640
 Whoa! Whipple, pull yourselves together. Wow. I know. This is what Nelson was just walking up

385
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,840
 and down in, unconcernally, and eventually he was hit. Pro-old Whipple, because he would be nervous

386
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:20,760
 having probably witnessed what just happened to your predecessor. In 2005, there was a big

387
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:26,840
 anniversary of Trafalgar, and it included a fireworks display, which used the same amount of

388
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:33,240
 gunpowder that HMS victory used in the Battle of Trafalgar. Wow. Oh, really? And so how much was that?

389
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,160
 I think it was about 12 tons. Cool. No, I'd be wrong. And there was also a naval battle reenactment,

390
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:41,960
 right? But they didn't say these are the British ships and these are the French, because they

391
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,400
 don't want to annoy the French, because relations with Kagan, they don't want to say, "Haha,

392
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,560
 we beat you." So they just said it was a reenactment of a sort of naval battle that would have taken

393
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:55,960
 place at that time. I think it's very considerate. Yeah. I don't have a lot of sympathy for the

394
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,880
 political correctness, God-man phrase, but that really does feel like... And they also feature an

395
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,520
 assimilation of the death of Nelson, where Nelson was played by Alex Naylor, who is described in the

396
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,480
 newspaper accounts at the time as a professional Nelson look-alike. Wow. Well, they not allowed

397
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:17,080
 to simulate that he actually died in case it offended people. And so... Well, they weren't actually

398
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:22,680
 allowed to kill Alex Naylor. No, I think political correctness has not gone far enough. Honestly, the guy

399
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:31,720
 played Scott. It's... I mean, there can't be much work for Nelson, professional Nelson. No, I didn't

400
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,560
 look up if he's still working or still doing it, but I'm sure it's a sideline. It's weird, you know,

401
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,560
 in Copenhagen when you see the people being statues that you don't ever see that of someone being...

402
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,080
 You do, but he's on a massive column. He's been holding that strong.

403
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:58,440
 This is my spot. The guy is hogging that plan. Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show,

404
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:04,760
 and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that in a chocolate hobnob,

405
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:14,200
 can you check a predict street for that? My fact is that in a chocolate hobnob, the chocolate

406
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:21,480
 is on the bottom. So for... I don't know if hobnobs are international. Are they all over the world?

407
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,440
 Are they in America and Australia? I can't remember. I do suspect them. It's a chocolate biscuit,

408
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:32,040
 a hobnob. It's like... No, a hobnob is like an oat biscuit, and they have chocolate hobnobs,

409
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:37,000
 which are oat biscuits with chocolate on them. And most normal people would probably assume

410
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,640
 that the chocolate was on the top. There's only on one side. It's only on one side, yeah. But then

411
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,120
 someone posted a picture on Facebook and asked Macvitties who make these biscuits, which side is the

412
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:54,680
 chocolate on the top of the bottom. And they said, we take our hobnobs and we clip them in a pool

413
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:01,320
 of chocolate. And so that means that the chocolate is on the bottom. They actually say reservoir

414
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,040
 of chocolate. And they use it a lot. And I've been googling reservoir of chocolate and I can't

415
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,640
 find... That's inaccurate, though, because you don't produce chocolate by waiting for it to fall

416
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:15,000
 from the sky and then storing it for years as you do with the water reservoir. So it should be a pool,

417
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,240
 maybe I don't know. Well, but then can we trust them about this up-down situation with them? Because

418
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:25,000
 actually reservoir does imply reserving something. Like it's a reservoir of water is something where

419
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,160
 you're keeping the water there for when you need it, right? Whereas the chocolate, I imagine, they

420
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:36,040
 probably change it pretty much every day. I would hope so. But here's my controversial hot take.

421
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:42,840
 On the packet of chocolate hobnobs, they clearly depict a hobnob with the biscuit side facing down

422
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,800
 and the chocolate side facing up. So either they are lying or you've got your packet upside down.

423
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,640
 And all the words should be... Either all the words should be upside down. All the biscuit should be

424
00:36:53,640 --> 00:37:00,680
 the other way up. Yeah, maybe they're showing the biscuit upside down on the... Why would you do that?

425
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,440
 But it's their decision, right? It's their decision.

426
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,320
 It's up to them. Basically, we're going on what MacVity say and it's their product, so they're allowed to

427
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,400
 say what they want. And they say it's on the bottom, so it's on the bottom. And it's all their chocolate

428
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:19,800
 biscuits, isn't it? They did. Well, here's another bit of evidence. Even we could hear the inverted

429
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:26,360
 words around the word evidence there. If you take a digestive biscuit, okay, they're not called

430
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,040
 digestive biscuits in America, are they? Because they don't help your digestion. I can't remember what

431
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:36,200
 they're called over there, but they're just basically biscuits. The top is rounded and has a MacVity's

432
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:43,000
 logo on and the bottom has kind of criss-cross on it. And then when you have a chocolate digestive,

433
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,880
 it's the criss-cross bit which has got the chocolate on it. So that it's much more clear that it's

434
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,240
 the bottom. Oh yeah, that's a really good point. Yeah, but if I saw someone eating a chocolate

435
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:59,400
 hobnob upside down, and when I say that, I mean, with the chocolate side on the bottom, I would think

436
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,680
 they were mad. Because now whenever I see anyone eating a chocolate hobnob the other way around,

437
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:12,280
 I'm going to go, excuse me. I'm already saying that's upside down. But again, for overseas listeners,

438
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:19,240
 the sort of who have switched off a long time ago. But sort of the massiveness of this news in this

439
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,960
 country, I told my white list this morning and she- And you're not divorced. Yeah, she couldn't believe it.

440
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,080
 She said, yeah, she said, "How dare you? Slapped me and walked away." It's big news. It's kind of like

441
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:35,160
 in America when we said this on the podcast a long time ago, someone wrote to Nike to say,

442
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,400
 is it Nike or Nike? And the owner came back and said, "It's Nike." And everyone was like, "Well,

443
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,640
 we've been saying Nike for years, and it's just a confirmation thing, but it's massive here." I

444
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:48,600
 wonder how much control they have over it. Once it goes out into the world, you don't get to choose

445
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,680
 how people pronounce a word. That's true. And you don't get to choose how people eat hobnops.

446
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,960
 No, thank God. But you do get to choose what your official answer is.

447
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,200
 Yeah, but you also get to choose how you depict it on the packet, if they really were committing it.

448
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,480
 But it looks like they put an upside down, they would put a hobnob on the packet the other way up.

449
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,480
 But then you wouldn't be able to see the chocolate very well. Oh, yeah. It would just look like a normal brown.

450
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,680
 But yeah, I think the reason that they show it upside down is so that you can see that it's a chocolatey one and not a normal one.

451
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,720
 That's a really good point. That's such a good point. Otherwise, you'd just be buying digestive biscuits,

452
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,880
 thinking in the hope there might be some chocolate underneath it. So if you weren't chocolate on the packet,

453
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,840
 what further proof do you need? Well, Nike says, "Biscuit on the packet." Why do you even need a picture?

454
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:41,240
 Why does it all of our packaging, of all of our things just have an explanation of what everything is?

455
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,960
 In fact, they're sold in flat packets where they're all on their edge. So this is a nonsense.

456
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,440
 That's the correct way up to use our hobnob. It's time it on its edge, particularly.

457
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,240
 But it's vertically into your mouth. You have to put your head sideways through your head.

458
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,200
 I was looking into McVitties. Oh, yeah.

459
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,840
 Yeah. McVitties have been around for a very long time.

460
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:10,680
 McVitties made the wedding cake for Queen Elizabeth and Philip's wedding today.

461
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,560
 Yeah, McVitties provided the official wedding cake. Everyone said it was upside down.

462
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,800
 They had the little squash to bride a group underneath it.

463
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:26,920
 Interestingly, they actually had 12 wedding cakes in total. They had the official one,

464
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,120
 which was made by McVitties, but this was 1947. There was a lot of rations going on at the time.

465
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,520
 11 cakes were donated by different countries from around the world to say you probably can't

466
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:43,240
 afford your own cake because of the rationing that's going so loud. Wow, all the impoverished

467
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,080
 commonwealth countries could be saving to make a cake just so they could deliver a sick burn.

468
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:54,760
 Yeah, so they would send ingredients. Sorry for sending all the marbles and all our

469
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,440
 treasures for the last 100 years. Yeah, you probably can't afford your own cake.

470
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,400
 But yeah, it's weird. It says the official cake was made using ingredients given as a wedding gift

471
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,600
 by Australian girl guides. I don't know if that means then McVitties turned that into a cake or if

472
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,440
 McVitties wasn't the official official. But yeah, you know the main cake was six feet tall.

473
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:22,840
 Was it the McVitties one, presumably? Yes, and it had a metal night on a horse on top of it.

474
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:30,360
 Pretty cool cake. Just one more thing, Prince William's wedding, 2011, his groom's cake for his wedding

475
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,400
 was 1,700 McVitties rich tea biscuits. Oh, terrible joy. Yeah, it was made from those.

476
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:42,040
 It wasn't like them stacked on each other. It was, I guess, crumbed up and used. But it was a McVitties cake

477
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,240
 as well. So that's two of the British royals who've had wedding cakes from McVitties.

478
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:52,040
 Oh, wow. You know the guy who actually news from this year, the guy who invented a lot of

479
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,400
 chocolate biscuits died recently. He died aged 81. It was last month and apparently he created

480
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:03,480
 chedders, many chedders, and he created cracker wheat and he created hobnops. And he worked for

481
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,960
 Meredith and Drew, which became United Biscuits, which are the company that own McVitties in 1960.

482
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,160
 And he invented a whole bunch of recipes and apparently people who worked with the company

483
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,360
 would just write down these recipes and then they'd shove them in a box somewhere and years

484
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,360
 after he left the company, they were running out of ideas and they went through his recipes

485
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:25,080
 and they made all these biscuits. The word hobnob used to mean to toast each other with drinks.

486
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,480
 It's in 12th night. Yeah, that's his first mention, isn't it?

487
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,680
 Yeah, first mention, 12th night. I saw this on the Inky Fool blog by a friend of ours

488
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,280
 called Mark Forsyth. And he said that the first record is in 12th night where an angry

489
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:48,680
 jewelist is described as hobnob is his word gift or take. And hobnob meant to give or take.

490
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:55,400
 It's like, you know, a positive or negative plus or minus give and take hobnob, hobnob meant to

491
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,040
 have and hobnob meant to not have. Makes sense? Really? To have and have an hob.

492
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:09,000
 And they're derived from ship spiscuits, which would have been used at the Battle of Trafalgar

493
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,760
 to eat. But ship spiscuits, they were kind of designed to be unbreakably hard.

494
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,680
 You had to dunk them to get them soft enough to eat. And even if you did dunk them sometimes,

495
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,000
 because biscuit means twice cooked is from the, I think, a French or probably originally Latin

496
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,640
 biscuit means twice cooked to make them hard to eat bacon and ties. But some ship spiscuits

497
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,680
 were baked four times for a really long voyage, if you needed really tough food.

498
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:37,240
 I was reading actually. I found an old book which was talking about the process of making

499
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:42,760
 naval biscuits. So this is a book from 1815, which was describing this guy who went to a biscuit

500
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,840
 factory. What was a biscuit factory then? And he described the mass production of biscuits,

501
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,480
 which involve five men around the oven and it involved lots of tossing lumps of dough to each other

502
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,880
 and then getting it exactly on the peel, which was the big plate at the right time. But the first

503
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,280
 thing that had to happen was the dough had to be needed. And the way the dough was needed was

504
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,080
 it's placed on top of a piece of machinery called a horse and a man literally rides the horse

505
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:12,040
 up and down until the dough is sufficiently needed. Where is the dough in between his bottom and the

506
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:19,480
 horse? Or is it the toes in between the horse and the table? Okay, but he needs to get on the horse

507
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:26,280
 in order to move it about. Right, I see. Because I was thinking about how the huns used to tenderise

508
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,560
 their meat by putting it in their trousers and then riding all day and then by the end of the day

509
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,720
 it was tender. And I was wondering if these biscuits were made in the same way.

510
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:43,400
 The hobnubs were named by John Murphy. They were going to be called old crunchies before that.

511
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,960
 And he has a history of naming things. He named British Telecom,

512
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:55,160
 Prozac and Homebase. No, no. He's a professional neighbour of things. That's just his job. He just

513
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,280
 goes and yeah, he saw a kind of gap in the market of when people were naming new companies and he's

514
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,360
 like, "I can do that." There's just all the things you need to lead a happy life, aren't they?

515
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,440
 Those whole things. Well, BT Homebase of Prozac. Yeah, and hobnubs.

516
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:16,600
 He says, "When it comes to naming, it's in thirds. One third is strategy. One third is creative.

517
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,960
 And the final third is checking that the name is available."

518
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:27,720
 And he also invented, I don't know if we've mentioned this before, "Cello Scrotum." Do you remember that?

519
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:34,040
 So, "Cello Scrotum" was a condition, a medical condition, that cellist's got.

520
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,680
 And apparently, rubbed against your scrotum when you played the cello, presumably played it wrong.

521
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:51,560
 He wrote to a newspaper, actually, to the BMJ, to the British Medical Journal, saying that he was

522
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,120
 a doctor and that he'd come up with this thing called "Cello Scrotum" and a lot of cellists were

523
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:01,000
 getting it, but actually it was a trick. And he was trying to make fun of the fact that all of these

524
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,400
 like housemaids, knee and golfer's elbow and all these kind of things were kind of taking on and he

525
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:12,680
 was trying to make fun of it. Oh, so that wasn't real. I think most cellists, this is a generalisation,

526
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:18,280
 are women. Sure. If you've got the cello Scrotum, you really have been playing it wrong.

527
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:27,320
 In April last year, five men were imprisoned for stealing a trailer with £20,000 worth of biscuits in

528
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:33,800
 it. That was the street value of the biscuits. The production value was £12,000. But they'd

529
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,880
 knit the trailer and it was found abandoned without the biscuits in it. I don't think the biscuits were

530
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,680
 recovered. And so they eventually admitted theft these five men. They were sentenced each of them to

531
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:47,880
 between 16 and 44 months. And as they were sentenced, one of them shouted, "Would you like a biscuit?"

532
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:55,960
 That's great. Did the judge at any point say they absolutely took the biscuit?

533
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,920
 Oh, that's great.

534
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:08,360
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to
