00:00:17,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:20,00:00:23,coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:27,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and"
00:00:27,00:00:32,James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:32,00:00:39,"facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go starting with you Anichezinski."
00:00:39,00:00:45,My fact this week is that the largest diamond ever found in Russia is called the 26th Congress
00:00:45,00:00:49,"of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, that's its name."
00:00:49,00:00:53,"That's it's catchy, that's it's catchy, shiny name, it's called this because it was"
00:00:53,00:00:59,mined in 1980 and the 26th Congress of the Communist Party opened in 1981 in February 1981.
00:00:59,00:01:03,So I think the diamond was actually named before the Congress happened so the Congress was
00:01:03,00:01:05,"this big meeting of all the Soviet delegates, all important."
00:01:05,00:01:08,"So was it a complete coincidence, did they think oh what should we call our meeting?"
00:01:08,00:01:11,"Let's name it after that lovely big diamond we found last year, what was that called?"
00:01:11,00:01:17,"Yeah, it was that, so it quickly had 25 similar conferences."
00:01:17,00:01:22,"It does not sound like a great party the 26th Congress of the Soviet Union, it sounds pretty"
00:01:22,00:01:26,grim because the leaders were pretty sclerotic and elderly at that point and it was was
00:01:26,00:01:28,a pressure never who was in charge at the time.
00:01:28,00:01:31,"Yeah, and he spoke for five hours didn't he?"
00:01:31,00:01:32,Do you?
00:01:32,00:01:33,"Yeah, he did a five hour opening speech."
00:01:33,00:01:39,"Another thing I like about this diamond is wow, five hour opening speech, that's sort"
00:01:39,00:01:40,of Castro level isn't it?
00:01:40,00:01:41,It's Ken Dodd level.
00:01:41,00:01:46,"Ken Dodd lovely, yeah, less entertaining I reckon."
00:01:46,00:01:51,But yeah so in the Soviet Union they just used to name stuff after really Soviet things
00:01:51,00:01:55,in a way that stopped making names kind of nice and attractive and pretty and started making
00:01:55,00:01:57,them sound very utilitarian.
00:01:57,00:02:04,"Yeah, and it all started after the October Revolution in 1917, so then they started calling"
00:02:04,00:02:11,"babies Soviet things, so in 1924 one baby got called octea brina after the October Revolution"
00:02:11,00:02:16,and then you got you know stalina when Stalin became a thing.
00:02:16,00:02:20,"They used to make names out of acronyms of all their heroes names, so a really popular name"
00:02:20,00:02:26,"was mels which stood for marks, angles, Lenin, Stalin and then actually when Stalin was when"
00:02:26,00:02:31,the Soviet Union distance itself from Stalin a lot of people dropped the S after so when
00:02:31,00:02:35,"they got rid of Stalin this up, where the name mel comes from like from the spice girls."
00:02:35,00:02:40,"Yeah, I don't think I think there might be a different origin to our version of mel, yeah."
00:02:40,00:02:49,"Mel C, the C actually stands for Communist and Mel B is a Bolshevik, yeah."
00:02:49,00:02:53,"This back on diamonds very quickly, I was looking down this big Wikipedia list of all the"
00:02:53,00:02:59,biggest diamonds and I saw one that caught my eye called the Jane Seymour diamond and the
00:02:59,00:03:03,Jane Seymour diamond is a ring which was named after the actress Jane Seymour.
00:03:03,00:03:07,She was very proud of it and when they were doing it sort of ceremonies she would go and
00:03:07,00:03:10,put the diamond on and be part of the ceremony to show it.
00:03:10,00:03:16,"She never owned it, she loved the idea of it, but what caught my eye is the fact that they"
00:03:16,00:03:20,are selling it now. So in July 2016 they announced that they were going to sell it and it led me
00:03:20,00:03:24,"down the road of seeing how interesting it is when you buy an expensive diamond, how it"
00:03:24,00:03:30,gets delivered to you. It's an eight hour luxury experience in buying the ring.
00:03:30,00:03:35,"So it begins with a journey by air by a helicopter, you get chauffeur by Rolls Royce to a private"
00:03:35,00:03:42,"luxury cruise and then on the 57th floor of a hotel you've surrounded by hang on, does"
00:03:42,00:03:49,the cruise go to the cruise ship of 57 store. They go to the 57th floor of a hotel.
00:03:49,00:03:56,"They're surrounded by 10,000 roses. They have an 18 course modern Asian menu with diamond"
00:03:56,00:04:00,and crusted chopsticks. I don't really like modern Asians.
00:04:00,00:04:07,"Okay, so this is why you didn't go for it. That's why I live with very cheap occasion."
00:04:07,00:04:12,"But to top it off, they present the ring at midnight while fireworks go off in the night sky."
00:04:12,00:04:16,That's how they're selling this ring. Can you turn it down at that point? Could you
00:04:16,00:04:21,say actually now that I've seen it? That sounds like such a slice of hot nonsense.
00:04:21,00:04:24,"Yeah, yeah, it really does. So you go on a helicopter ride to a cruise ship which then"
00:04:24,00:04:29,"pointlessly goes in a circle so you can go to a hotel. Yeah, go to the hotel first."
00:04:29,00:04:33,"Yeah, I mean, yeah. What, you'd be rubbish at a cruise with you. I won't have a two"
00:04:33,00:04:37,"week cruise, but actually I end up back where I started. So I'm not going to bother. We're"
00:04:37,00:04:41,just going to sit in this harbor for three weeks. I save a lot of money on cruises.
00:04:41,00:04:46,"But it's interesting. If you buy these rings and you get them insured, the insurance only"
00:04:46,00:04:50,"last for so long. There's a very famous ring called the Burton Taylor ring, which was Richard"
00:04:50,00:04:55,"Burton bought for Elizabeth Taylor. It cost 1.1 million. And because of the insurance,"
00:04:55,00:05:00,she was only allowed to wear it 30 days per year that they're willing to insure you for.
00:05:00,00:05:05,"Most times they need security. Yeah, it's really odd when Elizabeth Taylor was delivered"
00:05:05,00:05:10,"the ring. So again, the crazy security, she was in Monaco at the time. And three men carrying"
00:05:10,00:05:15,"briefcases, one of which carried the ring or went onto the plane at the same time and went"
00:05:15,00:05:17,"sort of different seats, different ways. So no one knew which briefcase it was going"
00:05:17,00:05:22,"to be in. And when they finally delivered to it, the guy with the briefcase that had the ring"
00:05:22,00:05:26,"in it also had three pairs of stockings that cost 50 cents in America, but was Elizabeth"
00:05:26,00:05:30,"Taylor's favorite, but she couldn't get in Monaco. So along with the ring were the"
00:05:30,00:05:33,three stockings. And everyone said she was way more excited by the stockings than she was
00:05:33,00:05:39,"by the ring that eventually arrived. Right. On helicopters and diamonds, this massive"
00:05:39,00:05:45,communist party diamond was found in the Mia mine. And the Mia mine is one of the biggest
00:05:45,00:05:50,"holes in the world. That's not quite kind James. Sure, it's got some of me. It's a bit better"
00:05:50,00:05:55,"than Wigan, but it's one of the biggest holes in the world. And Russia has banned helicopters"
00:05:55,00:06:00,from flying over it because they can get sucked in. They can get sucked in? Wow. Yeah.
00:06:00,00:06:08,"What sucks them all? Well, a big time and breathing monster. As it inhales. Well, what it is"
00:06:08,00:06:14,"is if you dig a hole deep enough, it gets really hot at the bottom because it's the pressure."
00:06:14,00:06:17,And that heats up the air. And obviously the air at the top because it's in the middle
00:06:17,00:06:23,of Siberia is cold. And so you get this convection current of air and it can cause a vortex.
00:06:23,00:06:28,"And so anything flying over the top of it can get sucked down into the. Wow. Oh, that's"
00:06:28,00:06:34,"cool. It's good, doesn't it? Why in birds? It gets sucked down chimneys. Because most chimneys"
00:06:34,00:06:40,are not the biggest hole in the world. I've understood James right. Yeah. It's the depth
00:06:40,00:06:46,"and the difference in heat, although I suppose a fire is quite hot. Hmm. If I'm ever flying"
00:06:46,00:06:50,"over that and the helicopter starts to get into trouble, I'll be able to say as we"
00:06:50,00:06:54,call it. This is quite interesting actually what's happening. It's due to a convection thing.
00:06:54,00:07:00,"There may a nine in the 1960s made 20% of all the gems in the world. Wow. Oh, they found"
00:07:00,00:07:05,"them there. And when they first dug it, it's in near Euclopska, I think. So it's really"
00:07:05,00:07:12,cold in the middle of Siberia and they had permafrost. So it's really icy there. And even
00:07:12,00:07:18,the dynamite wouldn't get through the permafrost because it was so cold. Wow. What?
00:07:18,00:07:23,There's Wacoel. I have a little more stuff on things being named Oddly in the Soviet Union
00:07:23,00:07:31,and elsewhere. Go. Okay. So loads of people during the French Revolution started changing
00:07:31,00:07:35,"their names as well. Basically, whenever there's a massive political upheaval, people start"
00:07:35,00:07:39,naming their babies crazy things. So what will you name your baby after? Jeremy Corbyn
00:07:39,00:07:49,"I would name him St. Jez. So in 1792, basically, there have been loads of rules up until that"
00:07:49,00:07:53,point on what you could name your babies. And then there was a rule change during the
00:07:53,00:07:58,"revolution which said, no, any citizen can change their name by just making a declaration"
00:07:58,00:08:01,at their local town hall wherever it might be. And there's a list of things that people
00:08:01,00:08:06,changed their names to and they are wild. So people chose names including Amos Sacrid
00:08:06,00:08:11,"La Patrie La Toie, which means Sacrid love of the native land year three, Morte, Alistair"
00:08:11,00:08:17,"Crat, death to aristocrats, which is a cool name. And my favourite is Simon La Liberté"
00:08:17,00:08:25,"La Morte, which means Simon Liberté La Death. Simon. Yeah. I'll just use Simon. Thanks. Someone"
00:08:25,00:08:31,after the Egyptian Revolution in 2011 called his daughter Facebook. Really? Yeah. Because
00:08:31,00:08:34,"it played a big part in organizing the protests. Yeah, not just because he liked seeing people"
00:08:34,00:08:39,thought he tried it. I would imagine that that person is going to find it hard to get a
00:08:39,00:08:46,Facebook account. Just on the largest diamond in the world. It's worth covering. It's called
00:08:46,00:08:54,"The Golden Jubilee, although it was originally called Unnamed Brown. It's a brown diamond."
00:08:54,00:08:58,"Didn't have a name. It's a brown diamond. Yeah, there's a lot of brown diamonds. What are"
00:08:58,00:09:03,"they? They're like diamonds, but they're brown. Yeah. It sounds like a very unpleasant"
00:09:03,00:09:10,"euphemism. Come back from the bathroom, kind of hobbling. Oh, it's a brown diamond day."
00:09:10,00:09:13,"So are they actually colour brown, or are they just sort of, they like, they murky with"
00:09:13,00:09:18,"infection? They're probably murky, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, well, so they actually are brown,"
00:09:18,00:09:22,"but they're very beautiful. Yeah. Just for the people at home, Dan is showing us on his"
00:09:22,00:09:29,"laptop, pictures of brown diamonds. Yes. And that is disgusting. Anyway, when it was found"
00:09:29,00:09:33,"in South Africa, this brown diamond got all these blessings. It was blessed by the Buddhist"
00:09:33,00:09:39,"Supreme Patriarch of Thailand, visited the Pope, and then it went to an Islamic scholar"
00:09:39,00:09:45,to be blessed by him as well. Did they all get to go on the boat trip and then in the helicopter
00:09:45,00:09:51,"and it's around about 20,000 roses? Dan, can you check Urban Dictionary? Well, you have"
00:09:51,00:09:55,"your laptop. We don't usually use laptops, but can you check Urban Dictionary to see if"
00:09:55,00:10:00,"brown diamond is a thing? Yes, sure. Just while Dan's doing that, thought you might like"
00:10:00,00:10:07,"to know there was a tradition in England of what's called ""Hortatory Names"". So it's extreme"
00:10:07,00:10:13,Puritans got names which were designed to encourage you to behave particularly well. So
00:10:13,00:10:17,"one of the men who rebuilt London after the Great Fire was called Nicholas Barben, right?"
00:10:17,00:10:24,"But his middle name was, if Christ had not died for the Thou had been damned, that was"
00:10:24,00:10:28,"from Sophie Hay, who we know. He was a friend of ours, he's a classical historian. He knows"
00:10:28,00:10:33,"a lot about Pompeii, but she also knows about him. He's not an amazing middle name. You hear"
00:10:33,00:10:38,"a lot of those. I think one or two of them turn out to be myths or post-Hok things, but"
00:10:38,00:10:44,"that one is real, isn't it? It is in Urban Dictionary. Okay, what's it mean? It's just as"
00:10:44,00:10:49,"we were saying, basically slang for turd or poo, i.e. my dog has left a minefield of brown"
00:10:49,00:10:55,"diamonds in the yard. Okay, now it's just a bit of knowledge. You clocked it. No, no, we're"
00:10:55,00:11:07,"going to call that knowledge. I'm going to try and unknow it. Okay, it is time for fact number"
00:11:07,00:11:13,"two, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that scientists have announced that they"
00:11:13,00:11:20,finally know why shoelaces untie themselves. Good old scientists. Do you know in Russia there's
00:11:20,00:11:25,"a joke, because we were talking about Russia before, where you say, according to British scientists"
00:11:25,00:11:30,"and then you say something ridiculous, and that's like a meme of jokes in Russia. Yeah,"
00:11:30,00:11:35,because they have this idea that all British scientists do is really ridiculous shoelace-related
00:11:35,00:11:42,"studies. Yeah, we haven't helped that already. This is a university researchers at a university"
00:11:42,00:11:48,"in California, Berkeley, and they were studying why shoelaces untie themselves. Surprisingly,"
00:11:48,00:11:53,"it's been a massive mystery to science for a very long time, so they dedicated their"
00:11:53,00:11:58,time to working that out. And it's interesting. It's all to do with the way that we slam our
00:11:58,00:12:02,"feet to the ground, and it plays with... Well, I didn't think it would be to do with how"
00:12:02,00:12:11,we clap our hands. Unless you wear your shoes on your hands. My pick-toki is poking through
00:12:11,00:12:19,"my gloves. Yeah, it's all to do with sort of gravity and so on. I don't fully understand"
00:12:19,00:12:27,"it. Yeah, yeah. One of the things that they're saying is that when you force your foot down,"
00:12:27,00:12:32,"you're going, you're going, you're going, you walk. You make it sound like you walk around"
00:12:32,00:12:37,"stepping your feet on the ground. You slam your foot down. Like Hagrid. Yeah, look at"
00:12:37,00:12:44,"it everywhere, like a giant. Yeah, so not Hagrid, sorry. When we're putting our feet down,"
00:12:44,00:12:49,"the shoelaces, the tips of the shoelaces that are left exposed are being pulled back up"
00:12:49,00:12:53,"as you go down by gravity, almost as if hands are pulling them because of the force that"
00:12:53,00:12:56,"we go down. Therefore, it's slowly loosening them and loosening them and it's going to take"
00:12:56,00:13:00,"more and more sense. Does that make sense? I might have made that up. Yeah, so the tips are"
00:13:00,00:13:03,"still pulling towards the ground when we're lifting our foot up. Yes, is that it? It's actually"
00:13:03,00:13:08,the flick. So the two things that caused that I think in the study said was it's caused
00:13:08,00:13:11,by a combination of the impact of the shoe on the ground as it hits the ground which deforms
00:13:11,00:13:16,"the knot itself and then the whipping of the laces as you lift your foot back up, pulls"
00:13:16,00:13:22,the laces away from already deformed knot. So does that mean like if you moonwalk everywhere
00:13:22,00:13:25,"then your shoelaces will never come undone. Yeah, that's absolutely true. So they tested"
00:13:25,00:13:30,with people either walking on the spot up and down without any forward motion and shoelaces
00:13:30,00:13:34,don't come undone and they tested that people were swinging their legs from a chair and shoelaces
00:13:34,00:13:37,"don't come undone. And I just want to say for the record, my shoelaces just don't come"
00:13:37,00:13:42,undone anyway so I don't understand what this whole... Why? Mine come undone all the time.
00:13:42,00:13:47,Do they really? Mine do sometimes. Yeah. This is a really interesting chat guys. I always
00:13:47,00:13:51,thought that we should add more personal touches to the podcast. Some people learn a bit
00:13:51,00:13:56,more about our personalities and now people know that your shoelaces never come undone.
00:13:56,00:14:02,But the mine sometimes too. Yeah. The Royal Society website described this study and it
00:14:02,00:14:07,was... I think it has been over-egging in a bit because they said as demonstrated using
00:14:07,00:14:11,"slow motion video footage and a series of experiments, the failure of the knot happens"
00:14:11,00:14:17,in a matter of seconds often without warning and is catastrophic. Wow. It's not the end
00:14:17,00:14:22,"of a cliff or something. That's true. I don't know if this is over-egging it as well,"
00:14:22,00:14:26,but they're saying that the forces that act on the tied shoelace can be greater than those
00:14:26,00:14:31,felt by humans on the most extreme roller coaster. Yeah. That's what your shoelace is going
00:14:31,00:14:35,through every time you put your foot down. It's like a mad roller coaster ride. They're
00:14:35,00:14:42,"saying 7G, which is seven times the force of gravity. And the biggest, most powerful"
00:14:42,00:14:48,roller coaster is the Tower of Terror in Johannesburg and that's 6.3G. And to put that into some
00:14:48,00:14:55,"kind of context, a space shuttle, someone in that would get 3G. I think so, they know the"
00:14:55,00:15:04,"stuff like that. Have you ever seen the website Ian's shoelace? Yes. Yes. It is fantastic, isn't"
00:15:04,00:15:09,"it? The best shoelace site I would say on the whole internet. Yep, okay. I agree. It's"
00:15:09,00:15:16,"a guy called Ian who has set up a site partly just to tell people about his own knot, which"
00:15:16,00:15:21,"is called the Ian knot. And he says it's, they securely tied. It's much better than the"
00:15:21,00:15:27,granny knot that almost everybody uses. And he says that there's also a high security
00:15:27,00:15:31,"version of it, which is called Ian's Secure shoelace knot. But he does say on the website,"
00:15:31,00:15:36,"note that my Ian knot is quite secure for all normal activities. Wow. Anna, maybe you're"
00:15:36,00:15:41,"using Ian's knot. Yeah, I think I am. The knot thing is unbelievable that we've all been"
00:15:41,00:15:47,tying our shoelaces wrong. I saw this in a TED talk. You saw an Ian's knot. So we are all
00:15:47,00:15:50,doing this granny knot on the way or most of us are. And the way you can tell is if you get
00:15:50,00:15:55,"your finger, if you sort of pull the sides of your shoelace part when your shoes are tied"
00:15:55,00:16:01,"in a bow, then the bow orient itself vertically. So orient itself away from your body. Whereas"
00:16:01,00:16:05,"if you've done a good knot and you pull the two sides of your shoelace part, then the"
00:16:05,00:16:09,bow orient itself horizontally. So it orient itself. Does that make sense? Just looking
00:16:09,00:16:15,at Dan's shoes now. And they have no laces. I'm not that tall either many more.
00:16:15,00:16:20,"Shell of one cliff too many. Well, you should explain that now that you know how to do"
00:16:20,00:16:26,"up shoes, which is basically when we do them up usually, you're putting the very first"
00:16:26,00:16:29,"cross you make with the laces, the very first one when you're doing our shoes in a bow,"
00:16:29,00:16:33,"you're putting the wrong lace over the top. And if you do the other one, then you'll"
00:16:33,00:16:37,find that it orient itself the right way and it's much stronger. So you put the left hand
00:16:37,00:16:42,lace over the top of the right hand lace and then draw it underneath. I've just redone
00:16:42,00:16:46,"it on myself. And I think because I'm left handed, I've been putting the left one over"
00:16:46,00:16:49,as is recommended. I was just going to say I bet left handed people do it differently.
00:16:49,00:16:53,"You've been doing it right. And they're very secure my laces. Well, no, they do come"
00:16:53,00:16:59,apart. Sometimes I was gone. I've given away too much about myself. I have to say I tried
00:16:59,00:17:04,"this last night and I, what my mind was blown, I would say, I'm so excited. I'm never going"
00:17:04,00:17:08,"to do my laces that wrong again. Can I just say on Ian very quickly, his website's"
00:17:08,00:17:13,"called Ian's shoelace site. Ian Feigen is his name. It's worth pointing out, he's made"
00:17:13,00:17:17,a whole side about shoelaces and he actually doesn't really overly care about shoelaces.
00:17:17,00:17:21,He kind of does what we do. He's picked a subject that he wants to mine and find out
00:17:21,00:17:26,"stuff about and just create a place that's the place to go to about the knowledge, the history"
00:17:26,00:17:29,and so on about it. So a huge shout out to him for just doing that. He doesn't
00:17:29,00:17:33,"give a shit about shoelaces. Are you sure he doesn't? He says on his site, I'm really not"
00:17:33,00:17:37,a knotting nut. I'm just a friendly Aussie guy trying to contribute to the internet. He
00:17:37,00:17:42,"has a celebrity section too. Does he? Yeah. What do Taylor Swift, John McEnroe and"
00:17:42,00:17:46,"Reese Witherspoon have in common? They all wear shoes. Well, they're all celebrities"
00:17:46,00:17:50,who I believe may be tying granny knots thanks to the telltale sign of crooked shoelace
00:17:50,00:17:55,bows that run along the shoe instead of across the shoe. Celebrities are human too. So who
00:17:55,00:17:59,"are they? Taylor Swift, John McEnroe. John McEnroe, Reese Witherspoon. So if I'm looking"
00:17:59,00:18:02,"for celebrities, they're not going to be the first three that I look for. Taylor Swift might"
00:18:02,00:18:08,"be, but John McEnroe probably would be down in the thousands. And so basically he's checked"
00:18:08,00:18:13,a lot of celebrities to get down as far as John McEnroe. And yet he doesn't care about shoelaces.
00:18:13,00:18:19,I think he went straight to John McEnroe because tennis is one of the jobs you'd have where
00:18:19,00:18:22,you'd really want strong shoelaces. You may have one of your extra grand slams had he been
00:18:22,00:18:27,"tying. And he's probably got a shoe. Like no one else on that list probably has a shoe, but"
00:18:27,00:18:30,"he'll have a sponsored shoe. Well, you know, you have, you have shoes as tennis players."
00:18:30,00:18:35,"We do also have shoes. There's other people. No, but I mean like the McEnroe shoe there"
00:18:35,00:18:40,might be. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I'm saying sports people tend to have shoes. Do they?
00:18:40,00:18:47,Yes. Zola Bud didn't. Who? I'm sorry. That's a very niche reference. But she used to run
00:18:47,00:18:53,without shoes. She's very famous for it. That is a fantastic joke for those who know who Zola
00:18:53,00:19:01,"Bud is. Sandy Shaw, is that no? No. She didn't wear shoes. Wait, the second. Yeah. Oh, yeah, she's"
00:19:01,00:19:05,never got shoes in the video clips. What did she build up against? Does that work for you guys?
00:19:05,00:19:11,Yes. Yes. Okay. We got the reference. Yeah. He didn't get any lucrative sponsorship deals
00:19:11,00:19:19,as he went to Mordor. So on knots. Yeah. Okay. This is so cool. Every single cell in your body
00:19:19,00:19:28,"has two meters of DNA in it, right? But according to science, anything longer than about 139 centimeters"
00:19:28,00:19:34,"is likely to get tied up in a knot spontaneously, just due to being agitated about 50 percent"
00:19:34,00:19:40,of the time. So how does our DNA not get into this massive tangled ball? And there are loads
00:19:40,00:19:44,of theories and scientists don't know. It's so cool. So one of the latest theories is that it's
00:19:44,00:19:48,"got these, I'm going to misexplanate, because it's quite complicated, but it's constantly slipping"
00:19:48,00:19:53,"through these rings like proteins. And basically, it gets bunched up in lengths like carriages"
00:19:53,00:19:58,"in a train. So you're interacting a bit with the rest of the length in your carriage, but"
00:19:58,00:20:02,you're not interacting with other lengths of the DNA. Okay. So it gets bunched up into balls
00:20:02,00:20:06,"which kind of run against each other. Basically, it gets bunched up into sections which are"
00:20:06,00:20:12,"much less likely to form knots. Okay. Is that like, if you put loads of elastic bands"
00:20:12,00:20:17,"in a box or something, they'd all get tangled up with each other maybe, but if you put elastic"
00:20:17,00:20:22,"band balls, then they wouldn't get tangled up with each other. I mean, that would be a great"
00:20:22,00:20:25,explanation if it was true. I don't know if it is. Because I really understood that very
00:20:25,00:20:31,it's true. I don't know if it is. Maybe it is. Okay. Let's go with that. So the idea that
00:20:31,00:20:37,things get tangled was discovered by Dorian Rayma and Douglas Smith and they won an
00:20:37,00:20:43,Ignobel Prize for Physics in 2008. And what they did was they put a load of cords in a rotating
00:20:43,00:20:49,"box and they did it more than 3,000 times. And they found that almost always it all got"
00:20:49,00:20:54,"knotted up. And this is why if you put your headphones in your pocket or if you, you know,"
00:20:54,00:20:58,"all that kind of stuff, it always gets tangled, right? Yeah. Basically, their explanation"
00:20:58,00:21:05,"is if you have a cord, there is only one way that it's not knotted mathematically. The way"
00:21:05,00:21:09,that it's not knotted is nothing is over the top of each other. Whereas there are hundreds
00:21:09,00:21:13,and thousands of ways that it might be knotted. So it's just much more likely that it'll
00:21:13,00:21:18,be one of those knotted states and one of the knotted states. But that's a bit loose.
00:21:18,00:21:23,So they haven't really cracked the mystery of when I wrap Christmas lights up in a perfect
00:21:23,00:21:30,role and put them in a box where they stay motionless for 360 days and then get them out. Why
00:21:30,00:21:35,"are they tangling? Oh, my God, you only have your Christmas lights up for five days a year."
00:21:35,00:21:41,"Yeah, or the preparing for Christmas more than a week in advance is bullshit."
00:21:41,00:21:47,Is it more likely that? It's screwed. It's because they take two months to or not. We don't
00:21:47,00:21:54,get them up until the second of January. Maybe it's tiny earthquakes. It's probably
00:21:54,00:21:57,"that. So there's always tiny earthquakes. Yeah, it must be that. But it does depend on"
00:21:57,00:22:05,the length of the cable as well. So if a cable is shorter than 46 centimeters. Which I imagine
00:22:05,00:22:15,that is Christmas lights probably are. Put them on a tiny twig of a tree. But if it's shorter
00:22:15,00:22:19,"than 46 centimeters, it will rarely, if ever, get knotted. So all you have to do is buy"
00:22:19,00:22:24,"headphone cables, which are shorter than 46 centimeters. And I'm sure that you're constantly"
00:22:24,00:22:35,"holding your phone in your face. The shoelaces get at least 12 mentions in the Bible. No, no, no, no, wrong."
00:22:35,00:22:39,It's true. I got this from Ian's shoelace site and he has a section called shoelaces as
00:22:39,00:22:46,seen in. And he's listed movies where Jesus's shoelaces came undone and low he tied them
00:22:46,00:22:57,"in. Well, Genesis, I've got one here. Genesis. What else? And on the eighth day. Can you give"
00:22:57,00:23:02,"us any quotes? Yes, so chapter and verse. So Genesis, it's that I would not take a thread"
00:23:02,00:23:09,"or a shoelace or anything that is yours, lest you should say I have made a room rich."
00:23:09,00:23:14,"Okay, here's that possible support for that. It wasn't earth see the ice man, who was about"
00:23:14,00:23:21,"5,500 years ago he lived then. His shoes were done up, weren't they, with kind of leather"
00:23:21,00:23:27,"songs, with some very rudimentary laces. So it's not inconceivable. Yeah, here's one from"
00:23:27,00:23:33,"American King James Version, John 127. Here it is, who coming after me is preferred before"
00:23:33,00:23:40,"me, whose shoelace I am not worthy to unloose. Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah, all right, fine. Wow,"
00:23:40,00:23:46,"right. We're buying it. Didn't think that was going to work. See, Ian, he knows his stuff,"
00:23:46,00:23:52,"does. Hey, if I say the phrase, I like your shoelaces to you. What is the appropriate response?"
00:23:52,00:23:58,"Oh, thank you, Ian. May I say, you're not has made all the difference in the world to me?"
00:23:58,00:24:06,Is that it? It's not. It is. Thanks. I stole them from the president. Does that ring any bells
00:24:06,00:24:10,"with you? It didn't for me. And I wonder if I'm being sort of internet. Well, it feels to me"
00:24:10,00:24:16,like it's a thing that you might say to prove your spy. So like if you're reading a newspaper
00:24:16,00:24:20,"in a park and someone said, I like your shoelaces, you would say that response. Yeah. And they"
00:24:20,00:24:26,would know you were a spy. It's very close. It's what people who use Tumblr say to detect
00:24:26,00:24:32,that another Tumblr user in the real world. So it's a code that they all know to say. I like
00:24:32,00:24:36,"your shoelaces. Well, you've just spoiled it now. No, because they all know it. Yeah, but now"
00:24:36,00:24:43,everyone else knows it. There used to be the Dennis the Menace Fine Club from the Bino used
00:24:43,00:24:48,to have a secret thing that you would say to people. I was a member of that. Do you remember
00:24:48,00:24:52,"the secret code? No, I don't. I don't know. You weren't a real member. You were one of the"
00:24:52,00:24:59,fake members. All your parents had just been doing it for the letter every week from Dennis
00:24:59,00:25:04,the Menace to you. Do you know Sandra? I'm not going to say what it is. But if anyone ever
00:25:04,00:25:08,"sees me in the street and you used to be a member, then I still know it. See James knows"
00:25:08,00:25:16,how to keep a secret down. So you know that extra hole on a shoelace. So you know when you
00:25:16,00:25:20,"often type a shoes. Yeah. And there's kind of a, you get to the top and then there's an extra"
00:25:20,00:25:25,"hole kind of just behind that. Often slightly lower, especially walking boots. You get this."
00:25:25,00:25:30,And so usually I just don't do anything with it. The purpose of it is for preventing blisters.
00:25:30,00:25:35,So what you do is you tie all your shoelaces up to the top like normal. And then you keep
00:25:35,00:25:40,your shoelace on the same side and thread it through that next hole to create a loop on
00:25:40,00:25:44,you do that on both sides. And then you weave the shoelaces on opposite sides through
00:25:44,00:25:48,the loops you've created. And this tightens it around your ankle and stops you from getting
00:25:48,00:25:54,blisters. That's great. Yeah. Look up a vid. It's simple and effective. That's what they
00:25:54,00:25:59,would teach you that when you're in scouts. Would they? Yeah. Good. I'm really giving away
00:25:59,00:26:03,"a lot about my childhood. Yeah. But they never taught me. Did they not? No. No, you weren't"
00:26:03,00:26:08,"really a scout. Well, your parents just said you were less of a baton power. Yeah, that's"
00:26:08,00:26:12,right. You're just done. Dennis and the meritorious guy. I'm very proud of you.
00:26:12,00:26:24,"Okay, it's time for pack number three. And that is Andy. My fact is that Nelson's ship HMS"
00:26:24,00:26:29,victory nearly didn't get out of the dock it was built in because it was too big. It was
00:26:29,00:26:33,a classic mistake. They thought we're going to build this fantastic big ship and they built
00:26:33,00:26:38,"it. And the night before the launch, the dockyard foreman looked at it and he thought, I wonder"
00:26:38,00:26:43,if it's too big. And he measured the ship at its widest point and then he measured the dock.
00:26:43,00:26:47,He found his horror. It was nine and a half inches wider than the dock. So rookie error.
00:26:47,00:26:53,It's a rookie. I look complete. Amateurism. And so like he told his boss who apparently fell
00:26:53,00:26:58,"into despair. I said, what are we going to do? The ship will get stuck if we try and launch"
00:26:58,00:27:01,it and it'll be massively embarrassing. And then the ship writes in the carpeters who were
00:27:01,00:27:04,"working at the dock just, you know, just wore away at the dock's timbers and removed"
00:27:04,00:27:10,"bits and they managed to save that crucial, you know, they must have removed about a foot."
00:27:10,00:27:13,"So it got through, but imagine it would have had about a couple of inches on either side."
00:27:13,00:27:19,Yeah. So exciting. I read that his boss was called John Allen and he was already suffering
00:27:19,00:27:25,from violence and frequent attacks of a billiest disorder in his bowels. And this could not
00:27:25,00:27:32,"have helped his brown diamonds will not have been amused. So, you know, I mean, this was said"
00:27:32,00:27:36,"at the time that, uh, eight years of victory nearly didn't make it to the Battle of Trafalgar,"
00:27:36,00:27:40,"but it was launched in 1765, 40 years before. So it probably would have caught up."
00:27:40,00:27:44,"Well, it was a long way away, wasn't it, from the location. Where did they build it? New"
00:27:44,00:27:48,Zealand or something and then set off towards the battle 40 years before.
00:27:48,00:27:56,"This isn't the only time this has happened. So, um, isn't by Kingdom Brunel built the world's"
00:27:56,00:28:01,first proper big iron ship. It was the first iron steam ship across the Atlantic. It was a massive
00:28:01,00:28:06,deal. It was a SS Great Britain and it was built to be a passenger service between Bristol and
00:28:06,00:28:12,"America, but when he built it, it was in Bristol, Docs in 1844 and it got trapped in the lock gates."
00:28:12,00:28:17,And I was reading a letter of apology he wrote to a people at a meeting he was supposed to be at
00:28:17,00:28:21,the next day saying he wasn't able to get there because this huge boat he built had got trapped
00:28:21,00:28:26,because the lock was too small and he'd been up all night having to dismantle the masonry of the lock
00:28:26,00:28:30,in order to get it out. And that's Brunel who you would have thought knows what he's doing.
00:28:30,00:28:35,It must be a thing you just forget to check. That last minute exit door bit.
00:28:35,00:28:40,I could click because it has happened a lot. There's a different one slightly. This could get out
00:28:40,00:28:46,"the dock, but have you heard of the Ural? It was called Ural. Yeah, the Ural. It's a famous ship."
00:28:46,00:28:48,"I'd not heard of it before. No, but there's a place called the Ural Mountains."
00:28:48,00:28:56,"Oh, okay. All right. So, this was commissioned in 1989 and it was 265 meters long, 36,000 tons."
00:28:57,00:29:03,"Basically, it was so large that nowhere was big enough to dock it. So, they had to dock it just off"
00:29:03,00:29:09,the harbor and just use it as a place where soldiers and naval officers could just have as a base
00:29:09,00:29:13,"and track things and so on and they've now decommissioned it, but they just couldn't use it. It was too"
00:29:13,00:29:16,"big. And it was supposed to be because it became basically a barracks, didn't it? But it was supposed"
00:29:16,00:29:21,"to be a huge thing for the Soviet Union. The technology on it was amazing. So, it was powered by"
00:29:21,00:29:27,"nuclear reactors. It was huge, like you said. It had the best in electronics and intelligence. It could"
00:29:27,00:29:32,see satellites from out of space. It could see any ballistic missiles that might be coming towards it.
00:29:32,00:29:37,It was supposed to be an amazing intelligence gathering ship that traveled around the world.
00:29:37,00:29:44,"And yet, they just built it too big. So, apron as a victory. This is quite cool. It was the same"
00:29:44,00:29:51,"age as Nelson, basically. As in when they had the battle, I think he was 48 and the ship was 47."
00:29:51,00:29:54,"So, not the same age. Not the same age. Yeah, all right."
00:29:54,00:30:01,"Different news at school. But they wouldn't know each other. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was big sister."
00:30:01,00:30:10,"When Nelson was born, was he too large to fit out of the earth? They had to physically dismantle him."
00:30:10,00:30:13,"Oh, God."
00:30:13,00:30:20,"But this is really cool. So, three years before the battle, he went around the forest of"
00:30:20,00:30:25,"damage, provided all the wood for the, you know, the Napoleonic Navy. And it was 6,000 trees."
00:30:25,00:30:28,"And he was appalled at what he found, right? Because loads of the forest was unavailable."
00:30:28,00:30:32,"Timber merchants were saying, no, you can't have this bitten. Lots of the rest of it had been kind of"
00:30:32,00:30:37,"ruined by charcoal burners. And Nelson said parliament should plant lots of new forests, right?"
00:30:37,00:30:42,"And a few years after he died in Trafalgar, they did plant a load of new forests. And two of the"
00:30:42,00:30:49,oaks planted during that ship building tree planting drive provided raw material to restore HMS
00:30:49,00:30:55,"victory 200 years later. Oh, that is so nice. How cool is that? Yeah, that's very cool. Do you know"
00:30:55,00:31:01,"how it got its name? The name victory? Yeah, victory. Was it not named until after the Battle of Trafalgar?"
00:31:01,00:31:05,It was just my name's brown. Was it named in a massive act of hubris?
00:31:05,00:31:13,"It was named, they say, potentially, because I think it's not fully known to commemorate the victories"
00:31:13,00:31:17,"that were happening in the year of 1759, which were a lot. And they called that year the year of"
00:31:17,00:31:22,"miracles, Annas Mirabilis, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, it's the year of miracles."
00:31:22,00:31:28,"But I suspect it was the other thing, because on the article it says, or it may have been chosen"
00:31:28,00:31:32,"simply because out of the seven names shortlisted, victory was the only one that was not in use."
00:31:32,00:31:38,Other six were already massive ship names. Yeah. So I reckon the ship's face was already.
00:31:38,00:31:45,The Battle of Trafalgar was obviously very heated. That's some statement. But
00:31:46,00:31:51,"Nelson was shot at the height of the battle, and his ship was tangled with a French ship, I think,"
00:31:51,00:31:55,"maybe a Spanish one, and there were snipers in the rigging of that ship shooting people on deck."
00:31:55,00:31:59,"But listen to this. So Nelson seemed like he really had a death wish, because he was walking up"
00:31:59,00:32:05,and down on deck in spite of that. He was dictating to his secretary who was called Scott at the time.
00:32:05,00:32:14,Scott got blasted in half by a cannonball. So Nelson's assistance quickly pick up his body and
00:32:14,00:32:17,"they throw him overboard. Nelson's response is just to say, ""Is that poor Scott?"""
00:32:17,00:32:20,"If you get hit by a cannonball, it could literally cut you in half."
00:32:20,00:32:23,"If a cannonball is fired, yeah, I mean that's a huge heavy lump of metal,"
00:32:23,00:32:26,"traveling at hundreds of miles an hour. Yeah, I'm not saying that it couldn't kill you,"
00:32:26,00:32:28,but I thought it would splatter you rather than just like literally.
00:32:28,00:32:32,I think he was in half. Well maybe he was almost cussed too. I don't know.
00:32:32,00:32:36,It probably wasn't a clean cut. I can't be saying that. It's like a guillotine.
00:32:37,00:32:46,"No. So anyway, Scott is no longer available for secretarial duties to put it mildly."
00:32:46,00:32:51,So then the next person to replace him is called Thomas Whipple. He arrives on deck. Nelson
00:32:51,00:32:56,"probably continues dictating to him. Yeah. Then Whipple dies almost immediately, because a cannonball"
00:32:56,00:33:00,"doesn't hit him, but it passes him and it's believed he was killed by the shockwave from..."
00:33:00,00:33:09,"Whoa! Whipple, pull yourselves together. Wow. I know. This is what Nelson was just walking up"
00:33:09,00:33:14,"and down in, unconcernally, and eventually he was hit. Pro-old Whipple, because he would be nervous"
00:33:14,00:33:20,"having probably witnessed what just happened to your predecessor. In 2005, there was a big"
00:33:20,00:33:26,"anniversary of Trafalgar, and it included a fireworks display, which used the same amount of"
00:33:26,00:33:33,"gunpowder that HMS victory used in the Battle of Trafalgar. Wow. Oh, really? And so how much was that?"
00:33:33,00:33:37,"I think it was about 12 tons. Cool. No, I'd be wrong. And there was also a naval battle reenactment,"
00:33:37,00:33:41,"right? But they didn't say these are the British ships and these are the French, because they"
00:33:41,00:33:45,"don't want to annoy the French, because relations with Kagan, they don't want to say, ""Haha,"
00:33:45,00:33:49,"we beat you."" So they just said it was a reenactment of a sort of naval battle that would have taken"
00:33:49,00:33:55,place at that time. I think it's very considerate. Yeah. I don't have a lot of sympathy for the
00:33:55,00:34:01,"political correctness, God-man phrase, but that really does feel like... And they also feature an"
00:34:01,00:34:06,"assimilation of the death of Nelson, where Nelson was played by Alex Naylor, who is described in the"
00:34:06,00:34:11,"newspaper accounts at the time as a professional Nelson look-alike. Wow. Well, they not allowed"
00:34:11,00:34:17,"to simulate that he actually died in case it offended people. And so... Well, they weren't actually"
00:34:17,00:34:22,"allowed to kill Alex Naylor. No, I think political correctness has not gone far enough. Honestly, the guy"
00:34:22,00:34:31,"played Scott. It's... I mean, there can't be much work for Nelson, professional Nelson. No, I didn't"
00:34:31,00:34:35,"look up if he's still working or still doing it, but I'm sure it's a sideline. It's weird, you know,"
00:34:35,00:34:39,in Copenhagen when you see the people being statues that you don't ever see that of someone being...
00:34:39,00:34:45,"You do, but he's on a massive column. He's been holding that strong."
00:34:45,00:34:58,"This is my spot. The guy is hogging that plan. Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show,"
00:34:58,00:35:04,"and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that in a chocolate hobnob,"
00:35:04,00:35:14,"can you check a predict street for that? My fact is that in a chocolate hobnob, the chocolate"
00:35:14,00:35:21,is on the bottom. So for... I don't know if hobnobs are international. Are they all over the world?
00:35:21,00:35:26,"Are they in America and Australia? I can't remember. I do suspect them. It's a chocolate biscuit,"
00:35:26,00:35:32,"a hobnob. It's like... No, a hobnob is like an oat biscuit, and they have chocolate hobnobs,"
00:35:32,00:35:37,which are oat biscuits with chocolate on them. And most normal people would probably assume
00:35:37,00:35:41,"that the chocolate was on the top. There's only on one side. It's only on one side, yeah. But then"
00:35:41,00:35:48,"someone posted a picture on Facebook and asked Macvitties who make these biscuits, which side is the"
00:35:48,00:35:54,"chocolate on the top of the bottom. And they said, we take our hobnobs and we clip them in a pool"
00:35:54,00:36:01,of chocolate. And so that means that the chocolate is on the bottom. They actually say reservoir
00:36:01,00:36:06,of chocolate. And they use it a lot. And I've been googling reservoir of chocolate and I can't
00:36:06,00:36:09,"find... That's inaccurate, though, because you don't produce chocolate by waiting for it to fall"
00:36:09,00:36:15,"from the sky and then storing it for years as you do with the water reservoir. So it should be a pool,"
00:36:15,00:36:19,"maybe I don't know. Well, but then can we trust them about this up-down situation with them? Because"
00:36:19,00:36:25,actually reservoir does imply reserving something. Like it's a reservoir of water is something where
00:36:25,00:36:29,"you're keeping the water there for when you need it, right? Whereas the chocolate, I imagine, they"
00:36:29,00:36:36,probably change it pretty much every day. I would hope so. But here's my controversial hot take.
00:36:36,00:36:42,"On the packet of chocolate hobnobs, they clearly depict a hobnob with the biscuit side facing down"
00:36:42,00:36:47,and the chocolate side facing up. So either they are lying or you've got your packet upside down.
00:36:47,00:36:53,And all the words should be... Either all the words should be upside down. All the biscuit should be
00:36:53,00:37:00,"the other way up. Yeah, maybe they're showing the biscuit upside down on the... Why would you do that?"
00:37:00,00:37:02,"But it's their decision, right? It's their decision."
00:37:02,00:37:07,"It's up to them. Basically, we're going on what MacVity say and it's their product, so they're allowed to"
00:37:07,00:37:11,"say what they want. And they say it's on the bottom, so it's on the bottom. And it's all their chocolate"
00:37:11,00:37:19,"biscuits, isn't it? They did. Well, here's another bit of evidence. Even we could hear the inverted"
00:37:19,00:37:26,"words around the word evidence there. If you take a digestive biscuit, okay, they're not called"
00:37:26,00:37:30,"digestive biscuits in America, are they? Because they don't help your digestion. I can't remember what"
00:37:30,00:37:36,"they're called over there, but they're just basically biscuits. The top is rounded and has a MacVity's"
00:37:36,00:37:43,"logo on and the bottom has kind of criss-cross on it. And then when you have a chocolate digestive,"
00:37:43,00:37:47,it's the criss-cross bit which has got the chocolate on it. So that it's much more clear that it's
00:37:47,00:37:53,"the bottom. Oh yeah, that's a really good point. Yeah, but if I saw someone eating a chocolate"
00:37:53,00:37:59,"hobnob upside down, and when I say that, I mean, with the chocolate side on the bottom, I would think"
00:37:59,00:38:04,"they were mad. Because now whenever I see anyone eating a chocolate hobnob the other way around,"
00:38:04,00:38:12,"I'm going to go, excuse me. I'm already saying that's upside down. But again, for overseas listeners,"
00:38:12,00:38:19,the sort of who have switched off a long time ago. But sort of the massiveness of this news in this
00:38:19,00:38:23,"country, I told my white list this morning and she- And you're not divorced. Yeah, she couldn't believe it."
00:38:23,00:38:29,"She said, yeah, she said, ""How dare you? Slapped me and walked away."" It's big news. It's kind of like"
00:38:29,00:38:35,"in America when we said this on the podcast a long time ago, someone wrote to Nike to say,"
00:38:35,00:38:39,"is it Nike or Nike? And the owner came back and said, ""It's Nike."" And everyone was like, ""Well,"
00:38:39,00:38:43,"we've been saying Nike for years, and it's just a confirmation thing, but it's massive here."" I"
00:38:43,00:38:48,"wonder how much control they have over it. Once it goes out into the world, you don't get to choose"
00:38:48,00:38:52,how people pronounce a word. That's true. And you don't get to choose how people eat hobnops.
00:38:52,00:38:57,"No, thank God. But you do get to choose what your official answer is."
00:38:57,00:39:02,"Yeah, but you also get to choose how you depict it on the packet, if they really were committing it."
00:39:02,00:39:07,"But it looks like they put an upside down, they would put a hobnob on the packet the other way up."
00:39:07,00:39:11,"But then you wouldn't be able to see the chocolate very well. Oh, yeah. It would just look like a normal brown."
00:39:15,00:39:20,"But yeah, I think the reason that they show it upside down is so that you can see that it's a chocolatey one and not a normal one."
00:39:20,00:39:25,"That's a really good point. That's such a good point. Otherwise, you'd just be buying digestive biscuits,"
00:39:25,00:39:29,"thinking in the hope there might be some chocolate underneath it. So if you weren't chocolate on the packet,"
00:39:29,00:39:34,"what further proof do you need? Well, Nike says, ""Biscuit on the packet."" Why do you even need a picture?"
00:39:34,00:39:41,"Why does it all of our packaging, of all of our things just have an explanation of what everything is?"
00:39:43,00:39:47,"In fact, they're sold in flat packets where they're all on their edge. So this is a nonsense."
00:39:47,00:39:52,"That's the correct way up to use our hobnob. It's time it on its edge, particularly."
00:39:52,00:39:57,But it's vertically into your mouth. You have to put your head sideways through your head.
00:39:57,00:40:02,"I was looking into McVitties. Oh, yeah."
00:40:02,00:40:04,Yeah. McVitties have been around for a very long time.
00:40:04,00:40:10,McVitties made the wedding cake for Queen Elizabeth and Philip's wedding today.
00:40:10,00:40:15,"Yeah, McVitties provided the official wedding cake. Everyone said it was upside down."
00:40:15,00:40:19,They had the little squash to bride a group underneath it.
00:40:19,00:40:26,"Interestingly, they actually had 12 wedding cakes in total. They had the official one,"
00:40:26,00:40:32,"which was made by McVitties, but this was 1947. There was a lot of rations going on at the time."
00:40:32,00:40:36,11 cakes were donated by different countries from around the world to say you probably can't
00:40:36,00:40:43,"afford your own cake because of the rationing that's going so loud. Wow, all the impoverished"
00:40:43,00:40:47,commonwealth countries could be saving to make a cake just so they could deliver a sick burn.
00:40:47,00:40:54,"Yeah, so they would send ingredients. Sorry for sending all the marbles and all our"
00:40:54,00:40:58,"treasures for the last 100 years. Yeah, you probably can't afford your own cake."
00:41:02,00:41:07,"But yeah, it's weird. It says the official cake was made using ingredients given as a wedding gift"
00:41:07,00:41:12,by Australian girl guides. I don't know if that means then McVitties turned that into a cake or if
00:41:12,00:41:16,"McVitties wasn't the official official. But yeah, you know the main cake was six feet tall."
00:41:16,00:41:22,"Was it the McVitties one, presumably? Yes, and it had a metal night on a horse on top of it."
00:41:22,00:41:30,"Pretty cool cake. Just one more thing, Prince William's wedding, 2011, his groom's cake for his wedding"
00:41:31,00:41:37,"was 1,700 McVitties rich tea biscuits. Oh, terrible joy. Yeah, it was made from those."
00:41:37,00:41:42,"It wasn't like them stacked on each other. It was, I guess, crumbed up and used. But it was a McVitties cake"
00:41:42,00:41:45,as well. So that's two of the British royals who've had wedding cakes from McVitties.
00:41:45,00:41:52,"Oh, wow. You know the guy who actually news from this year, the guy who invented a lot of"
00:41:52,00:41:57,chocolate biscuits died recently. He died aged 81. It was last month and apparently he created
00:41:57,00:42:03,"chedders, many chedders, and he created cracker wheat and he created hobnops. And he worked for"
00:42:03,00:42:09,"Meredith and Drew, which became United Biscuits, which are the company that own McVitties in 1960."
00:42:09,00:42:13,And he invented a whole bunch of recipes and apparently people who worked with the company
00:42:13,00:42:16,would just write down these recipes and then they'd shove them in a box somewhere and years
00:42:16,00:42:20,"after he left the company, they were running out of ideas and they went through his recipes"
00:42:20,00:42:25,and they made all these biscuits. The word hobnob used to mean to toast each other with drinks.
00:42:25,00:42:29,"It's in 12th night. Yeah, that's his first mention, isn't it?"
00:42:29,00:42:34,"Yeah, first mention, 12th night. I saw this on the Inky Fool blog by a friend of ours"
00:42:34,00:42:40,called Mark Forsyth. And he said that the first record is in 12th night where an angry
00:42:40,00:42:48,jewelist is described as hobnob is his word gift or take. And hobnob meant to give or take.
00:42:48,00:42:55,"It's like, you know, a positive or negative plus or minus give and take hobnob, hobnob meant to"
00:42:55,00:43:00,have and hobnob meant to not have. Makes sense? Really? To have and have an hob.
00:43:00,00:43:09,"And they're derived from ship spiscuits, which would have been used at the Battle of Trafalgar"
00:43:09,00:43:12,"to eat. But ship spiscuits, they were kind of designed to be unbreakably hard."
00:43:12,00:43:16,"You had to dunk them to get them soft enough to eat. And even if you did dunk them sometimes,"
00:43:16,00:43:21,"because biscuit means twice cooked is from the, I think, a French or probably originally Latin"
00:43:21,00:43:25,biscuit means twice cooked to make them hard to eat bacon and ties. But some ship spiscuits
00:43:25,00:43:30,"were baked four times for a really long voyage, if you needed really tough food."
00:43:30,00:43:37,I was reading actually. I found an old book which was talking about the process of making
00:43:37,00:43:42,"naval biscuits. So this is a book from 1815, which was describing this guy who went to a biscuit"
00:43:42,00:43:46,"factory. What was a biscuit factory then? And he described the mass production of biscuits,"
00:43:46,00:43:51,which involve five men around the oven and it involved lots of tossing lumps of dough to each other
00:43:51,00:43:55,"and then getting it exactly on the peel, which was the big plate at the right time. But the first"
00:43:55,00:44:00,thing that had to happen was the dough had to be needed. And the way the dough was needed was
00:44:00,00:44:05,it's placed on top of a piece of machinery called a horse and a man literally rides the horse
00:44:05,00:44:12,up and down until the dough is sufficiently needed. Where is the dough in between his bottom and the
00:44:12,00:44:19,"horse? Or is it the toes in between the horse and the table? Okay, but he needs to get on the horse"
00:44:19,00:44:26,"in order to move it about. Right, I see. Because I was thinking about how the huns used to tenderise"
00:44:26,00:44:31,their meat by putting it in their trousers and then riding all day and then by the end of the day
00:44:31,00:44:35,it was tender. And I was wondering if these biscuits were made in the same way.
00:44:37,00:44:43,The hobnubs were named by John Murphy. They were going to be called old crunchies before that.
00:44:43,00:44:47,"And he has a history of naming things. He named British Telecom,"
00:44:47,00:44:55,"Prozac and Homebase. No, no. He's a professional neighbour of things. That's just his job. He just"
00:44:55,00:45:00,"goes and yeah, he saw a kind of gap in the market of when people were naming new companies and he's"
00:45:00,00:45:04,"like, ""I can do that."" There's just all the things you need to lead a happy life, aren't they?"
00:45:04,00:45:08,"Those whole things. Well, BT Homebase of Prozac. Yeah, and hobnubs."
00:45:08,00:45:16,"He says, ""When it comes to naming, it's in thirds. One third is strategy. One third is creative."
00:45:16,00:45:19,"And the final third is checking that the name is available."""
00:45:19,00:45:27,"And he also invented, I don't know if we've mentioned this before, ""Cello Scrotum."" Do you remember that?"
00:45:27,00:45:34,"So, ""Cello Scrotum"" was a condition, a medical condition, that cellist's got."
00:45:34,00:45:38,"And apparently, rubbed against your scrotum when you played the cello, presumably played it wrong."
00:45:38,00:45:51,"He wrote to a newspaper, actually, to the BMJ, to the British Medical Journal, saying that he was"
00:45:51,00:45:56,"a doctor and that he'd come up with this thing called ""Cello Scrotum"" and a lot of cellists were"
00:45:56,00:46:01,"getting it, but actually it was a trick. And he was trying to make fun of the fact that all of these"
00:46:01,00:46:05,"like housemaids, knee and golfer's elbow and all these kind of things were kind of taking on and he"
00:46:05,00:46:12,"was trying to make fun of it. Oh, so that wasn't real. I think most cellists, this is a generalisation,"
00:46:12,00:46:18,"are women. Sure. If you've got the cello Scrotum, you really have been playing it wrong."
00:46:18,00:46:27,"In April last year, five men were imprisoned for stealing a trailer with £20,000 worth of biscuits in"
00:46:27,00:46:33,"it. That was the street value of the biscuits. The production value was £12,000. But they'd"
00:46:33,00:46:37,knit the trailer and it was found abandoned without the biscuits in it. I don't think the biscuits were
00:46:37,00:46:42,recovered. And so they eventually admitted theft these five men. They were sentenced each of them to
00:46:42,00:46:47,"between 16 and 44 months. And as they were sentenced, one of them shouted, ""Would you like a biscuit?"""
00:46:47,00:46:55,That's great. Did the judge at any point say they absolutely took the biscuit?
00:46:56,00:46:58,"Oh, that's great."
00:46:58,00:47:08,"Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to"
