00:00:00,00:00:14,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:14,00:00:17,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:17,00:00:22,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and"
00:00:22,00:00:27,"Anna Chazinski, and once again we've gathered around the microphone only this time, we've"
00:00:27,00:00:32,got a big announcement to make right at the top of this show. We are releasing our first
00:00:32,00:00:37,"ever book. I forgot to mention that to you, actually."
00:00:37,00:00:39,One of the last to know everything in this episode.
00:00:39,00:00:43,You're not involved.
00:00:43,00:00:46,"So yeah, No Such Thing as a Fish, we're releasing a book, we've signed a deal, and the book"
00:00:46,00:00:51,"is being released in November. If you're hearing these words, you can pre-order it now."
00:00:51,00:00:58,"Go to Amazon and click the button, it's a book that click the button, it's a Amazon.com"
00:00:58,00:01:00,and click the button. It's on the front page.
00:01:00,00:01:01,It's on the front page.
00:01:01,00:01:03,"It's on the middle of the page saying, ""By the fish book now."""
00:01:03,00:01:09,"I think what you want to do is go to qi.com/shop, and we're going to have a link there that"
00:01:09,00:01:12,"you click on, which will take you to the page where you can pre-order the book. And it's"
00:01:12,00:01:17,"going to be called the book of the year, and it's going to be about the year that's happening"
00:01:17,00:01:23,"right now, and it's by us, go to Amazon, or go to qi.com/shop, and you'll be able to pre-order"
00:01:23,00:01:24,it.
00:01:24,00:01:28,"Yeah, and it's going to be packed with all the most interesting stories that we found from"
00:01:28,00:01:33,2017. This is one that I want to get into the book. Mafia members in Sicily have been banned
00:01:33,00:01:40,"from becoming godfathers. So this is an archbishop who has said that at baptisms, if you are involved"
00:01:40,00:01:44,"in the mafia, you are now not allowed to become a godfather."
00:01:44,00:01:49,"This is one that I've got, when they voted for the UK general election, there was only 13"
00:01:49,00:01:53,"MPs that didn't vote for it, and one of them did it because it was going to interfere with"
00:01:53,00:01:54,his honeymoon.
00:01:54,00:01:58,"Okay, this is one that I'd like to get in. This is something that's been revealed in the"
00:01:58,00:02:05,"last couple of weeks, and it's that a Norwegian slow TV show that follows my grating reindeer"
00:02:05,00:02:09,has had to be suspended after the reindeer stopped moving all together.
00:02:09,00:02:15,"I've got the fact that I'd like to get into the book, which is that Jeremy Corbyn has"
00:02:15,00:02:20,won seven elections for Parliamentary Beard of the Year.
00:02:20,00:02:21,Wow.
00:02:21,00:02:22,Really?
00:02:22,00:02:24,"Yeah, and it's practically unparalleled in modern history."
00:02:24,00:02:26,Is he the current reigning champ?
00:02:26,00:02:31,"He's the current Labour leader. Yeah, it's depending on when you're listening to this."
00:02:31,00:02:33,Is that what he spends all his time campaigning for then?
00:02:33,00:02:37,"Yes, he's supposed all the actual beard of the year, quite a long time ago, I think."
00:02:37,00:02:39,"Yeah, as opposed to the niche Parliamentary beard of the year."
00:02:39,00:02:42,"Yeah, I think that's like qualifying round time."
00:02:42,00:02:44,I think I'll make the regionals.
00:02:44,00:02:45,Yeah.
00:02:45,00:02:46,He made global beard of the year.
00:02:46,00:02:47,"Oh, I think it's British beard."
00:02:47,00:02:48,It's British beard.
00:02:48,00:02:49,A British beard of the year.
00:02:49,00:02:50,I can't.
00:02:50,00:02:56,"He is the reigning champion, yes, and he won, I think, with 64% of the vote last year, which"
00:02:56,00:02:59,is slightly more than he won that year's leadership contest with.
00:02:59,00:03:02,When is the next championship?
00:03:02,00:03:03,It'll be this year.
00:03:03,00:03:11,"In time for our book, I think it will be in time for the book, so we'll be able to announce"
00:03:11,00:03:13,whether he's won it a record seven time.
00:03:13,00:03:16,"That's hope so, because if we had a book of news of 2017, we weren't able to get in the"
00:03:16,00:03:17,results of beard of the year.
00:03:17,00:03:18,It would just be a joke.
00:03:18,00:03:23,"Sorry, I think it'd be Parliamentary beard of the year."
00:03:23,00:03:24,Yeah.
00:03:24,00:03:26,"Yeah, so that's it."
00:03:26,00:03:29,The book's going to be just packed with all that sort of stuff.
00:03:29,00:03:33,And we thought we would spend this episode not telling you our most interesting fact
00:03:33,00:03:36,"that we've learned over the last seven days, strictly from all of history, but we would"
00:03:36,00:03:40,pick something that we want to go into this book and pitch it to each other.
00:03:40,00:03:44,"So that's what we're going to do, starting with you, Andy."
00:03:44,00:03:50,My fact that I would like to get into the book is that ideas proposed for the U.S. border
00:03:50,00:03:56,"wall include a trench full of nuclear waste, a one-way mirror, and three million hammocks"
00:03:56,00:03:57,next to each other.
00:03:57,00:03:58,What?
00:03:58,00:03:59,Three million hammocks?
00:03:59,00:04:00,Yeah.
00:04:00,00:04:04,"It's so much a serious proposal, but-- No, because you could just go under them."
00:04:04,00:04:08,"Or over them, depending on how high up the tree they're tied."
00:04:08,00:04:11,"Ah, so they're going to be trees along this border."
00:04:11,00:04:13,"I think it's not a fixed proposal, yeah."
00:04:13,00:04:14,I think you could plant the trees.
00:04:14,00:04:16,"You'd have to have something to attack the hammocks, too."
00:04:16,00:04:17,Yeah.
00:04:17,00:04:19,It's the idea that you get to a hammock.
00:04:19,00:04:20,It looks so comfortable.
00:04:20,00:04:22,"You lie down, happen that, and you never make it across."
00:04:22,00:04:24,"I think that's the idea, yeah."
00:04:24,00:04:30,"There is an artist whose name is Jennifer Meridian, whose proposed that one she's proposed"
00:04:30,00:04:36,"also a wall of pipe organs and a wall of lighthouses, thousands and thousands of lighthouses."
00:04:36,00:04:39,"So this was a big push, wasn't it, for proposals to be sent in?"
00:04:39,00:04:40,Yeah.
00:04:40,00:04:44,"So they had a little five-day window where you could submit your proposals, and then they're"
00:04:44,00:04:48,"going to pick around 20 finalists in about a month or so, and they're going to build prototypes"
00:04:48,00:04:49,of their sections of the wall.
00:04:49,00:04:52,How are they going to build a prototype of the nuclear waste one?
00:04:52,00:04:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:53,00:04:56,Just a little bit of depleted Uranium.
00:04:56,00:04:57,"Yeah, exactly."
00:04:57,00:04:58,Yeah.
00:04:58,00:04:59,I don't know.
00:04:59,00:05:01,The Mero is a very interesting idea.
00:05:01,00:05:02,Incredible idea.
00:05:02,00:05:05,"You can see Mexico from the USA, but they can't see you."
00:05:05,00:05:06,Yeah.
00:05:06,00:05:07,What's the point in that?
00:05:07,00:05:08,I have no idea.
00:05:08,00:05:11,You could still see someone approaching if they were going to try and climb the mirror.
00:05:11,00:05:14,And you don't know if you're approaching for the Mexican side.
00:05:14,00:05:16,You don't know if anyone is watching that.
00:05:16,00:05:17,If you're watching that.
00:05:17,00:05:18,What's this?
00:05:18,00:05:19,Yeah.
00:05:19,00:05:20,Okay.
00:05:20,00:05:21,"I thought it was just that the Mexicans go to war and go, ""Oh no, it's just exactly like"
00:05:21,00:05:22,"here, we might as well say."""
00:05:22,00:05:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:23,00:05:24,There are loads of proposals.
00:05:24,00:05:26,One of them has a monorail going all the way along the top.
00:05:26,00:05:27,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:27,00:05:28,"Like a hyperloop, they're calling it, right?"
00:05:28,00:05:29,"Yeah, but it's a monorail."
00:05:29,00:05:30,Is it a monorail?
00:05:30,00:05:31,"Yeah, okay."
00:05:31,00:05:32,What's the difference between those two things?
00:05:32,00:05:36,"Oh, one sounds super futuristic, and the other sounds like monorail."
00:05:36,00:05:37,Yeah.
00:05:37,00:05:40,We've all seen that episode of The Simpsons.
00:05:40,00:05:46,"I read the rules for the proposals, the idea of what the wall needs to withstand."
00:05:46,00:05:52,"It's, ""Nesawidstand attacks from,"" here's the quote, ""Sledgehammer, Carjack, Pickaxe, Chisel,"
00:05:52,00:05:58,"Battery Operated Impact Tools, any kind of handheld tools, and not only does it have"
00:05:58,00:06:02,"to sort of deal with the impacts, but it should be able to deal with it for up to four hours."""
00:06:02,00:06:03,So specifically--
00:06:03,00:06:04,Four hours.
00:06:04,00:06:05,So it's four hours of a sledgehammer.
00:06:05,00:06:08,"Meanwhile, there's some luck next to you who are the chisel, right?"
00:06:08,00:06:09,That's it.
00:06:09,00:06:14,"It's like, ""Why do you need to specify the chisel when you've also got the car jacker smashing"
00:06:14,00:06:15,"into it?"""
00:06:15,00:06:16,The four hours.
00:06:16,00:06:17,We've made it.
00:06:17,00:06:23,"We've made it car jackproof, but there's a chisel weakness of what we're going to do."
00:06:23,00:06:24,It's like the Death Star.
00:06:24,00:06:25,There's going to be a chisel one.
00:06:25,00:06:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:26,00:06:27,A little weak spot.
00:06:27,00:06:30,"So it's a very stupid idea, obviously."
00:06:30,00:06:31,Yeah.
00:06:31,00:06:35,"And they want it ideally to be 30-foot tall, and so all the proposals had-- so it's a 30-foot"
00:06:35,00:06:36,tall mirror.
00:06:36,00:06:37,It's quite cool.
00:06:37,00:06:38,Wow.
00:06:38,00:06:40,He's become more flexible on the 30-foot thing.
00:06:40,00:06:41,Yes.
00:06:41,00:06:42,I think he's gone.
00:06:42,00:06:43,"He said anything over 18 feet, might be okay."
00:06:43,00:06:44,18 feet.
00:06:44,00:06:45,Yeah.
00:06:45,00:06:49,"One of the problems is that they obviously need to build the wall on their side of the land,"
00:06:49,00:06:50,on the American side of the land.
00:06:50,00:06:55,But there's a lot of American landowners who have houses and property that go on the
00:06:55,00:06:58,"other side of these rivers and bits of land, generally."
00:06:58,00:07:02,"So to build the wall, he's actually going to be sealing out a lot of Americans, and they're"
00:07:02,00:07:05,going to be stuck in Mexico unless they sell their land.
00:07:05,00:07:09,So he's trying to buy the land back from them for the government.
00:07:09,00:07:10,He knows there's going to be problems.
00:07:10,00:07:15,So he's planning to effectively go into legal war with a lot of Americans over there.
00:07:15,00:07:20,"So in 2006, they started building a lot of walls at various points, and there were"
00:07:20,00:07:26,"442 lawsuits that were reviewed by CNN from the time, and 93 of them are still open."
00:07:26,00:07:27,Wow.
00:07:27,00:07:30,And that was for a much shorter wall.
00:07:30,00:07:34,"Was that because also in 2006, I think George Bush approved a virtual wall."
00:07:34,00:07:38,"I think we've talked about the idea of virtual wall before, but he worked on that."
00:07:38,00:07:42,"The project was shelved in 2011, and it cost a billion dollars."
00:07:42,00:07:45,"Sorry, is that a billion real dollars or a billion virtual dollars?"
00:07:45,00:07:48,"It's sadly, I think it's real dollars."
00:07:48,00:07:53,But the thing about the virtual wall was that it worked by a system of censors that was
00:07:53,00:07:56,"supposed to be able to tell where migrants were crossing the border, but apparently it"
00:07:56,00:08:02,"was really ineffective in windy conditions, in mistook trees and plants for people."
00:08:02,00:08:05,It was constantly thinking that animals crossing the border represent a suspicious
00:08:05,00:08:06,activity.
00:08:06,00:08:07,Right.
00:08:07,00:08:11,"One person has proposed leaving a four-inch gap at the bottom of the wall, so that little"
00:08:11,00:08:13,animals can cross.
00:08:13,00:08:19,"One problem is that there are 111 species, which cross the area currently proposed for the"
00:08:19,00:08:25,"wall, and so lots of them will struggle to mate and breed and live a full, fulfilling"
00:08:25,00:08:26,life.
00:08:26,00:08:31,"I wonder if all the animals will then evolve to be four-inch as tall, like tidy buffaloes"
00:08:31,00:08:34,going over the range.
00:08:34,00:08:35,I've got an idea.
00:08:35,00:08:36,What about this?
00:08:36,00:08:43,"You kind of make a very slight incline from about two miles out, and it just gets more and"
00:08:43,00:08:46,"more incline, incline, incline, incline."
00:08:46,00:08:48,"And then on the Mexican side, it's a sheer drop."
00:08:48,00:08:49,Do you know what I mean?
00:08:49,00:08:50,Like a cliff.
00:08:50,00:08:55,"So from the American side, it just looks like a normal bit of like a har-har in an English"
00:08:55,00:08:56,country garden.
00:08:56,00:08:57,Exactly like that.
00:08:57,00:09:02,"Well, that's a bit like the apparent border between North and South Korea, right?"
00:09:02,00:09:03,Really?
00:09:03,00:09:07,"So about North Korea claims there's a wall dividing it from South Korea, and that the"
00:09:07,00:09:12,US and South Korea built this wall a few decades ago during the Cold War.
00:09:12,00:09:17,"And they say on their side, it's got like little crenellations where guns are, and it's got"
00:09:17,00:09:19,"checkpoints along it, and it's this big wall."
00:09:19,00:09:23,"And then it says on the other side, on the South Korea side, it's just covered in turf"
00:09:23,00:09:24,and grass.
00:09:24,00:09:26,And so nobody knows that it's there from the other side.
00:09:26,00:09:30,And the US and South Korea totally deny that they ever built this wall.
00:09:30,00:09:35,"But there's evidence, someone did a documentary, I think, where they claim to be showing pictures."
00:09:35,00:09:38,So we've got no idea if North Korea is divided from South Korea by a wall.
00:09:38,00:09:43,"I saw a photo of, because there are doors on the border where the North Koreans and South"
00:09:43,00:09:47,"Koreans have police, and they open up to either let people in."
00:09:47,00:09:52,"And when they open up the door, if it's a police officer opening the door on the South Korean"
00:09:52,00:09:56,"side, the rule is, is that another South Korean officer has to be holding onto them, because"
00:09:56,00:09:59,they might be pulled through by the North Koreans.
00:09:59,00:10:04,"There's photos you can see online where they're like holding like by the arm, another South"
00:10:04,00:10:05,Korean police officer opening a door.
00:10:05,00:10:06,"Yeah, it's amazing."
00:10:06,00:10:07,That's so funny.
00:10:07,00:10:13,Do you know the first ever demarcation between America and Mexico when they first decided to
00:10:13,00:10:14,do it?
00:10:14,00:10:16,They just drew a line.
00:10:16,00:10:17,Really?
00:10:17,00:10:18,"Yeah, drew it."
00:10:18,00:10:19,Just drew a line on the floor.
00:10:19,00:10:20,What?
00:10:20,00:10:21,Really?
00:10:21,00:10:22,It's a pretty one.
00:10:22,00:10:26,"You know, like in old sitcoms where you would draw a line around half of the house and"
00:10:26,00:10:29,you'd draw a lot on your side and you'd draw that on the floor.
00:10:29,00:10:30,What was the marker pen?
00:10:30,00:10:32,I don't know what it was with.
00:10:32,00:10:33,I guess it was just a line on the sand.
00:10:33,00:10:34,It's probably right.
00:10:34,00:10:35,It's a bit sandy.
00:10:35,00:10:36,Yeah.
00:10:36,00:10:37,"Well, that's true."
00:10:37,00:10:38,"Well, you can't paint sand."
00:10:38,00:10:39,You can't paint sand.
00:10:39,00:10:40,You can't paint sand.
00:10:40,00:10:41,"Well, you can move the line."
00:10:41,00:10:42,You can move the line.
00:10:42,00:10:46,It's just quite handy.
00:10:46,00:10:49,Our country looks a bit smaller today.
00:10:49,00:10:51,And then they just started making fences.
00:10:51,00:10:54,And the reason they made fences is because they didn't want Mexican animals to go into
00:10:54,00:10:57,American territory because they had like diseases and stuff like that.
00:10:57,00:10:58,Really?
00:10:58,00:10:59,Yeah.
00:10:59,00:11:00,So it wasn't for people.
00:11:00,00:11:04,"And when they made it for people even, it wasn't stop Mexicans from coming in."
00:11:04,00:11:06,It was to stop Chinese immigrants from coming in.
00:11:06,00:11:07,Really?
00:11:07,00:11:08,Yeah.
00:11:08,00:11:10,So was that like start of the 20th century or something?
00:11:10,00:11:12,"It was during the Depression, I think."
00:11:12,00:11:13,So yeah.
00:11:13,00:11:14,"Right, yeah, OK."
00:11:14,00:11:20,"So last week, Congress approved spending for replacing existing fencing."
00:11:20,00:11:25,"Different building, a new wall, there's a strong argument that this is never going to happen."
00:11:25,00:11:30,"So they approved spending to replace existing fencing along 20 miles, which is 1% of the"
00:11:30,00:11:33,"border, and to add gates to existing barriers, apparently."
00:11:33,00:11:39,"So it'll be, I think, slightly more porous the border than before because it'll have gates."
00:11:39,00:11:42,"But anyway, Sean Spicer got into a matter of row at the press because he was saying, look"
00:11:42,00:11:45,"at this great wall, and everyone said, hang on, that stuff was a fence when you described"
00:11:45,00:11:46,it in January.
00:11:46,00:11:50,It's literally exactly the same structure you were calling it a fence.
00:11:50,00:11:53,"And he said, no, it's a wall, it's definitely a wall."
00:11:53,00:11:55,He got really touchy about it.
00:11:55,00:11:56,"That's clever, though."
00:11:56,00:11:59,It probably cost a lot less to just have a chat with the OED and bribe them to change the
00:11:59,00:12:00,definition of the wall.
00:12:00,00:12:04,A wall to a line of paint in the sand.
00:12:04,00:12:08,But if you just do like they did with their north and south career thing and just say there's
00:12:08,00:12:14,"a wall there, when there isn't a wall there, I don't think that's beyond Trump's."
00:12:14,00:12:15,You're right.
00:12:15,00:12:16,He can do it.
00:12:16,00:12:17,He can do it.
00:12:17,00:12:18,Yeah.
00:12:18,00:12:20,"All he has to do is say, hey guys, we did it."
00:12:20,00:12:21,We made a wall.
00:12:21,00:12:23,"And everyone goes, there's no wall here."
00:12:23,00:12:24,"He's like, yeah, there is."
00:12:24,00:12:25,Yeah.
00:12:25,00:12:26,What do you want about it?
00:12:26,00:12:28,You're a wall.
00:12:28,00:12:30,There was a design that someone came up with in 2009.
00:12:30,00:12:35,"So well before Trump was even thinking about being a candidate, which was a barrier, which"
00:12:35,00:12:37,is lined with burrito carts.
00:12:37,00:12:44,"So it's a proper wall and barrier, but along the ground, like those desks you have to meet"
00:12:44,00:12:47,people in prisons to visit them so you can have a bit of conversation with them.
00:12:47,00:12:48,Yeah.
00:12:48,00:12:51,"So there's a barrier there, which is permeable, you can see through it and you can pass things"
00:12:51,00:12:52,through it.
00:12:52,00:12:53,Burritos.
00:12:53,00:12:54,And you can pass burritos through.
00:12:54,00:12:57,"And he said, who's passing to who?"
00:12:57,00:12:58,I imagine you're selling burritos.
00:12:58,00:13:01,Probably the burrito seller to the burrito buyer.
00:13:01,00:13:02,Yeah.
00:13:02,00:13:03,OK.
00:13:03,00:13:04,But it can go both ways.
00:13:04,00:13:06,"Yeah, because money could go the other direction."
00:13:06,00:13:07,Exactly.
00:13:07,00:13:09,"Or if you wanted to sell hot dogs in the other direction, you could do that."
00:13:09,00:13:10,Yeah.
00:13:10,00:13:11,OK.
00:13:11,00:13:16,"It's called Ronald Rail, and he said the burrito wall accommodates for a food cart to be inserted"
00:13:16,00:13:18,into the wall.
00:13:18,00:13:23,"Seating is built into the wall and food, conversation or a buy national game of footsie can occur across"
00:13:23,00:13:24,the border.
00:13:24,00:13:25,Wait a minute.
00:13:25,00:13:27,So you can play footsie.
00:13:27,00:13:30,"So maybe that's that four-inch gap, you can."
00:13:30,00:13:31,Yeah.
00:13:31,00:13:34,"But you know, there is like, there is an existing wall in various parts, of course."
00:13:34,00:13:35,Yeah.
00:13:35,00:13:37,"And over there, they sometimes play volleyball."
00:13:37,00:13:38,No.
00:13:38,00:13:43,"Historically, they have, yeah. And they'll sometimes have poetry competitions like rap battles."
00:13:43,00:13:44,Wow.
00:13:44,00:13:47,"But volleyball, you wouldn't be able to see which way the bull was going until it was on"
00:13:47,00:13:48,your side of the wall.
00:13:48,00:13:52,That's why the Americans won a one-way mirror.
00:13:52,00:13:56,That's the winner of volleyball.
00:13:56,00:13:57,Not really.
00:13:57,00:13:59,It hasn't touched the ground all the way here.
00:14:05,00:14:11,"Okay, it is time to move on to fact number two and that is James."
00:14:11,00:14:12,Okay.
00:14:12,00:14:18,"I think we might have some North Korean stuff in this book, in this book of 2017, very much"
00:14:18,00:14:19,in the news.
00:14:19,00:14:22,And so here's my North Korea fact.
00:14:22,00:14:28,"North Korea's national airline, Koreo, owns 10 times more taxis than it owns aeroplanes."
00:14:28,00:14:29,Taxis?
00:14:29,00:14:30,Yeah.
00:14:30,00:14:34,They only have 15 aeroplanes.
00:14:34,00:14:38,And I found that they've recently branched out into taxis.
00:14:38,00:14:41,And I found that they have about 150 taxis.
00:14:41,00:14:45,"And what we think might have happened is there's a lot of sanctions, obviously, against North"
00:14:45,00:14:46,Korea.
00:14:46,00:14:49,So they're not allowed to fly to as many places as they used to be.
00:14:49,00:14:52,So they need to find other ways to make money and one of the ways they're doing it is branching
00:14:52,00:14:58,"out into things like soda and cigarettes and, in this case, taxis."
00:14:58,00:15:00,"And this is quite a famous airline, isn't it?"
00:15:00,00:15:06,"Because they're famously rated one star, they're the only one star airline in the world."
00:15:06,00:15:07,Yeah.
00:15:07,00:15:11,"But not for danger, for quality of service, which is important to emphasize."
00:15:11,00:15:16,I think there's only been one fatal accident on Air Koreo and that was 1983.
00:15:16,00:15:20,That was a car crash.
00:15:20,00:15:27,"That was at a time when the airline was called KAC, so CWAK, I suspect that's how you pronounce"
00:15:27,00:15:28,it.
00:15:28,00:15:29,"But yeah, it's perfectly safe."
00:15:29,00:15:31,The service is very bad.
00:15:31,00:15:39,Do they have a drag people off planes who've got a perfectly legal ticket?
00:15:39,00:15:42,But the Inflight Entertainment sounds like fun.
00:15:42,00:15:43,Oh yeah.
00:15:43,00:15:50,You get patriotic songs sung by the band Moran Bong.
00:15:50,00:15:55,"And I looked into Moran Bong a bit more, and he actually put them together, Kim Jong-un."
00:15:55,00:15:57,Did he like the Simon Cowell of North Korea?
00:15:57,00:15:58,Yes.
00:15:58,00:16:04,"No, he put them together, and they are 20 members, and they're all young women, and they're"
00:16:04,00:16:06,all quite senior military ranks as well.
00:16:06,00:16:09,"So sometimes they perform in uniform, and sometimes they perform in mini skirts and"
00:16:09,00:16:10,high heels.
00:16:10,00:16:11,"Well, multi-talented."
00:16:11,00:16:12,Yeah.
00:16:12,00:16:19,"You don't want to get the wrong costume when you're going to wild, are you?"
00:16:19,00:16:22,"Although there was that military march in North Korea a couple of years ago, which showed"
00:16:22,00:16:25,"the female soldiers marching, and they were all wearing really high heels."
00:16:25,00:16:26,Do you remember?
00:16:26,00:16:27,"Oh yeah, yeah."
00:16:27,00:16:28,Yeah.
00:16:28,00:16:32,"You've got to appreciate, because it's quite hard to walk in high heels, isn't it?"
00:16:32,00:16:33,Yeah.
00:16:33,00:16:35,"If you can march in them, then they're good soldiers."
00:16:35,00:16:37,I think that's quite a good policy.
00:16:37,00:16:38,You're right.
00:16:38,00:16:41,"Because if you can do well in high heels, then you're definitely going to do okay in your"
00:16:41,00:16:42,tragedy.
00:16:42,00:16:50,"But they've got songs, sorry, to be obsessed with Moran Bong, but the tracks they say include."
00:16:50,00:16:53,Let's support our supreme commander with arms.
00:16:53,00:16:57,"We think of the martial day and night, the martialist Kim Jong-un."
00:16:57,00:17:00,"They also play the theme from Rocky, and my way."
00:17:00,00:17:01,"Oh, really?"
00:17:01,00:17:04,"But with the original lyrics, or..."
00:17:04,00:17:05,I don't know.
00:17:05,00:17:06,Mmm.
00:17:06,00:17:07,So.
00:17:07,00:17:10,"Sorry, I feel like I went on an extended route about Moran Bong, though."
00:17:10,00:17:15,"So is it a solid 20 people, or are they sort of on a rotational..."
00:17:15,00:17:16,"No, that's solid."
00:17:16,00:17:19,"And then they disappeared for a while, and then they came back with no explanation."
00:17:19,00:17:20,"Like, take that."
00:17:20,00:17:22,Take that.
00:17:22,00:17:26,So a lot of the news when North Korea has been their missile tests.
00:17:26,00:17:27,Yeah.
00:17:27,00:17:30,And their most advanced missile is the Musu Dan.
00:17:30,00:17:35,"That's the Musu Dan, not the Musu Comet Dan, this is the Musu Dan."
00:17:35,00:17:40,"And they've done eight attempts, and it's failed six times, okay?"
00:17:40,00:17:48,"So that's a 75% failure, which is a worse failure percentage than Sunderland have had."
00:17:48,00:17:52,Sunderland have failed to win 67% of their Premier League matches in the bottom of the league.
00:17:52,00:17:53,Wow.
00:17:53,00:17:58,And I believe Donald Trump has actually dispatched a fleet to Sunderland.
00:17:58,00:18:01,"If someone starts doing well, should we be concerned?"
00:18:01,00:18:04,I don't think that's going to happen.
00:18:04,00:18:09,"So the weapon that the US would use, if they were going to launch a strike on North Korea's"
00:18:09,00:18:15,"nuclear facilities, is this thing called a mop, which is a stance for a massive ordinance"
00:18:15,00:18:23,"penetrator, it is a 30,000 pound bomb and it can smash through 200 feet of earth or 60 feet"
00:18:23,00:18:25,of concrete before it explodes.
00:18:25,00:18:26,Oh my god.
00:18:26,00:18:27,60 feet.
00:18:27,00:18:28,Oh my god.
00:18:28,00:18:29,60 feet of concrete.
00:18:29,00:18:30,How's it doing that?
00:18:30,00:18:31,Go ahead.
00:18:31,00:18:36,"It's, I mean, is it just big and it's heavy or is it going to drill on the front?"
00:18:36,00:18:40,"It's a bit like, do you know when you're drilling on the ground, then you get a pocket"
00:18:40,00:18:41,of air and it--
00:18:41,00:18:48,"I don't want to say it, but listeners of a previous episode will notice a similar sounding"
00:18:48,00:18:51,bit of bullshit from--
00:18:51,00:18:54,It's using that same technology then.
00:18:54,00:19:00,"But in reverse, what it is done actually, it's got a little chisel on the front of it."
00:19:00,00:19:03,"I just want to say, I've had multiple people write in and confirm that story was true"
00:19:03,00:19:08,about the guy being sucked through the earth and this one is also true.
00:19:08,00:19:13,"This one's blown through the earth not sucked, but it's the same general event."
00:19:13,00:19:17,"Does it have an explosive as it hits the earth, which is a sort of first explosive and then"
00:19:17,00:19:19,"as soon as it's lower, then it has a big--"
00:19:19,00:19:21,I don't know how the technology works.
00:19:21,00:19:22,That's a really good idea.
00:19:22,00:19:23,So many explosions.
00:19:23,00:19:24,Yeah.
00:19:24,00:19:28,"I thought it was more like a drill, like it dives down so hard into the earth, it just penetrates"
00:19:28,00:19:29,it.
00:19:29,00:19:30,60 feet of concrete.
00:19:30,00:19:31,60 feet of concrete.
00:19:31,00:19:32,A concrete.
00:19:32,00:19:33,200 feet of earth.
00:19:33,00:19:34,Yeah.
00:19:34,00:19:36,"So yeah, that's not something that's--"
00:19:36,00:19:38,"That's a hell, it could get through a hell."
00:19:38,00:19:39,Yeah.
00:19:39,00:19:41,That's mad.
00:19:41,00:19:45,Remember that I said that if you cornered a badger on the street that it could--
00:19:45,00:19:46,Sorry.
00:19:46,00:19:50,"I don't remember this, then."
00:19:50,00:19:51,So hang on.
00:19:51,00:19:52,You're in a street.
00:19:52,00:19:53,And you cornered a badger.
00:19:53,00:19:54,Yeah.
00:19:54,00:19:55,You're in a street corner.
00:19:55,00:19:56,Yeah.
00:19:56,00:19:57,I guess it's a street corner.
00:19:57,00:19:58,You're in a cul-de-sac.
00:19:58,00:19:59,In a cul-de-sac.
00:19:59,00:20:00,Yeah.
00:20:00,00:20:01,The badger doesn't know where to go.
00:20:01,00:20:02,It's a concrete street.
00:20:02,00:20:08,The claws of a badger are so sharp that it can grind its way through the concrete floor.
00:20:08,00:20:12,"So you also just need a badger on the end of this pond, and that it drills down really"
00:20:12,00:20:13,hard.
00:20:13,00:20:14,Or just badger claws.
00:20:14,00:20:17,So it just slices through the ground.
00:20:17,00:20:21,"There are also plants that can go through concrete, aren't there?"
00:20:21,00:20:26,You can get weeds and you can get fungi and stuff that can actually grow through concrete.
00:20:26,00:20:28,So if you work bothered about how long it took--
00:20:28,00:20:29,That's true.
00:20:29,00:20:35,"A plant on the end of your bum, and then when it lands."
00:20:35,00:20:39,It would have to be a negative geotropic plant because it's digging downwards.
00:20:39,00:20:40,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:40,00:20:45,And it has to go with roots that are more than 60 feet long.
00:20:45,00:20:51,"This year, this year, a guy called Quang Song Han became the first North Korean to"
00:20:51,00:20:56,"ever score in Serie A in Italy, which is the top league in Italy."
00:20:56,00:21:04,"So he scored against the goalkeeper who he beat was Joe Hart, the England No. 1 goalkeeper."
00:21:04,00:21:05,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:05,00:21:09,Not the one who was fired for eating a pie.
00:21:09,00:21:13,He's not England's goalkeeper now to use Sutton United's goalkeeper.
00:21:13,00:21:14,This is all right.
00:21:14,00:21:16,I'm confusing Sutton United in England.
00:21:16,00:21:21,"There's a fact that I hope makes it into the book, which James found about that goalkeeper"
00:21:21,00:21:23,who got fired for eating the pie.
00:21:23,00:21:24,Do you remember it?
00:21:24,00:21:25,"He got a new job, didn't he?"
00:21:25,00:21:27,But I can't remember what it was.
00:21:27,00:21:32,His first job after it was that he was a food taster for...
00:21:32,00:21:33,Textmext restaurants.
00:21:33,00:21:34,Textmext restaurants.
00:21:34,00:21:35,Yeah.
00:21:35,00:21:36,Post-being goalie for Sutton.
00:21:36,00:21:41,"Anyway, so it's quite good that England's goalkeeper is the first goalkeeper ever to let"
00:21:41,00:21:44,in a goal from a North Korean in Serie A.
00:21:44,00:21:50,Maybe they might spare us when they sweep the power in gratitude for that.
00:21:50,00:21:55,"They were also speaking of North Korean sport on the nuclear testing site, their main nuclear"
00:21:55,00:21:58,"testing site, which is just outside Pyongyang."
00:21:58,00:22:02,"I think a US satellite, the week before last, spotted a volleyball game being played."
00:22:02,00:22:03,Really?
00:22:03,00:22:06,"So that's nice that these guys are having fun and they're off time, yeah, right on the site."
00:22:06,00:22:10,Are you sure that wasn't by the border wall that you were talking about between South
00:22:10,00:22:11,and North?
00:22:11,00:22:12,"There is no wall, though."
00:22:12,00:22:13,"Oh, there is no wall."
00:22:13,00:22:16,"Well, I think if volleyball's going on, there is a fucking wall."
00:22:16,00:22:22,There's a wall on one side and then a two-mile gradual decrease on the other.
00:22:22,00:22:26,So you hit the ball over the wall and then it just keeps rolling and rolling and you have
00:22:26,00:22:28,to lock two miles to collect it.
00:22:28,00:22:29,Yeah.
00:22:29,00:22:36,I've got a couple of things about just general airline news from around the world.
00:22:36,00:22:43,"Singapore Airlines are flying now, not using your classic airfuel, but cooking oil."
00:22:43,00:22:45,They're flying using cooking oil.
00:22:45,00:22:46,Yeah.
00:22:46,00:22:47,They are.
00:22:47,00:22:52,So this is a thing that they are trying to reduce aviation emissions and they've launched
00:22:52,00:22:53,this thing.
00:22:53,00:22:58,"It's called the green package and it's powered in part by sustainable biofuel, which is"
00:22:58,00:22:59,used from cooking oil.
00:22:59,00:23:03,"So if you're ever flying Singapore Airlines, there might be a moment which I never will"
00:23:03,00:23:05,be able to have on.
00:23:05,00:23:10,Sorry to be a fossil fuel stick in the mud.
00:23:10,00:23:16,"I did it, is it extra virgin or are we talking sunflower oil?"
00:23:16,00:23:17,I don't know.
00:23:17,00:23:18,"No, not sure."
00:23:18,00:23:19,"Because you only want the high quality stuff, I think."
00:23:19,00:23:20,It's true.
00:23:20,00:23:21,Yeah.
00:23:21,00:23:24,Do you remember that was that bus in Bristol that was poo-powered?
00:23:24,00:23:25,Yes.
00:23:25,00:23:27,It was going to be running on...
00:23:27,00:23:31,Would you rather travel on a poo-powered plane or an extra virgin on a oil-powered plane?
00:23:31,00:23:33,"Oh, wow."
00:23:33,00:23:34,Yeah.
00:23:34,00:23:39,"Given the choice, as long as they both work, it doesn't really affect your flight, does"
00:23:39,00:23:40,it?
00:23:40,00:23:41,It might do.
00:23:41,00:23:44,"Do you not think the fumes, if the fumes could seep up through the canteen, but you certainly"
00:23:44,00:23:45,rather the oil.
00:23:45,00:23:49,"But yeah, I rarely got aeroplanes to think, I can just smell kerosene the whole way."
00:23:49,00:23:53,"No, but you do get the smell of it on the runway, don't you?"
00:23:53,00:23:56,"When you're crossing from the terminal building, sometimes to go into the plane, you can smell"
00:23:56,00:23:57,a bit of fuel there.
00:23:57,00:23:58,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:58,00:24:01,"So if it's a tank of poo, I probably would go with the cooking oil."
00:24:01,00:24:03,Or as you had delicious cooking oil.
00:24:03,00:24:04,Yeah.
00:24:04,00:24:05,Cool.
00:24:05,00:24:06,"I've got another one, which is, I'd love to get this in the book."
00:24:06,00:24:09,It's my favourite character that I discovered in the last year or so.
00:24:09,00:24:12,It's the Iraqi Transport Minister.
00:24:12,00:24:18,"So plane, aeroplane news from him that happened in the last month is that while flying in a plane,"
00:24:18,00:24:24,"as a passenger, with 200 other passengers on board, he went to the cockpit and said, I would"
00:24:24,00:24:25,like to land the plane.
00:24:25,00:24:29,"And they said, okay, I guess we have to let you, you're the Iraqi Transport Minister,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,he's quite a powerful guy.
00:24:31,00:24:33,I think it just does that.
00:24:33,00:24:34,Was it an Iraqi plane?
00:24:34,00:24:35,"Yeah, yeah."
00:24:35,00:24:36,Okay.
00:24:36,00:24:38,"No, it wasn't, he wasn't like on British Airways covered it."
00:24:38,00:24:43,"Imagine if John Prescott truly knew he would have covered it, tried to land the plane."
00:24:43,00:24:50,"I've done a poo, and I'd like it to power this plane."
00:24:50,00:24:56,So apparently they let him take control of the planes to land the plane and they said it
00:24:56,00:24:57,was almost fatal.
00:24:57,00:25:03,"Unfortunately, the captain managed to get back into the controls in time in order to stop"
00:25:03,00:25:04,them from dying.
00:25:04,00:25:05,"What, why did he let him?"
00:25:05,00:25:08,"This whole was the Transport Minister, he's an important guy, you don't, yes."
00:25:08,00:25:10,"Yeah, I don't know, maybe he's a massive deal."
00:25:10,00:25:12,"So, okay, this is a quote from the pilots."
00:25:12,00:25:13,I don't know why.
00:25:13,00:25:19,"Then you're on a plane, you don't go, right, he's the most important person here."
00:25:19,00:25:22,"Well, you know, I'm actually the mayor of Swidden."
00:25:22,00:25:28,"Okay, you can land it."
00:25:28,00:25:31,"This is a quote from the pilot, posse event."
00:25:31,00:25:33,The minister did not do a good job.
00:25:33,00:25:37,He slammed the front of the plane into the ground.
00:25:37,00:25:40,"All the Rocky planes in future will have to have a fake cockpit, basically."
00:25:40,00:25:46,"The minister turns up, yeah."
00:25:46,00:25:55,"Okay, there's time to move on to fact number three, and that is my fact, which I am pitching"
00:25:55,00:26:03,"to get into the book, and that fact is that all NASA astronauts are wearing hand-me-downs."
00:26:03,00:26:09,"Now, when a bigger astronaut, when they grow up enough to fit into the suit, they're right."
00:26:09,00:26:13,"Exactly, no, this is a new story that's just come out, and that's a fact that sort of emerge"
00:26:13,00:26:14,from it.
00:26:14,00:26:19,It's that NASA has suddenly realized that of all the functioning spacesuits that they have
00:26:19,00:26:24,"for the astronauts to do there when they go outside of the International Space Station,"
00:26:24,00:26:29,they're running out because they only made a batch of them and they haven't made any more.
00:26:29,00:26:34,"So they're really running low on them, and every time a new astronaut goes up, they're basically"
00:26:34,00:26:35,using a hand-me-down.
00:26:35,00:26:43,"They're using a previously used astronaut suit, space suit, and yeah, so they've got, I think,"
00:26:43,00:26:47,"17 more missions, and let's say the backpack alone that's part of the suit."
00:26:47,00:26:51,"They've only got 11 of those that are left that are functional, and they don't think they're"
00:26:51,00:26:55,"going to survive in order to finish all of the missions, and so they've got more missions"
00:26:55,00:26:57,"than they have suits, basically, at this point."
00:26:57,00:27:01,"I think if you don't have the suit, don't go on the mission, I mean..."
00:27:01,00:27:03,"Well, we put it in now."
00:27:03,00:27:06,It'd be a shame to cancel.
00:27:06,00:27:11,"Last year, NASA had a, what they called, a very tweedy, a poop challenge, which was"
00:27:11,00:27:18,"asking for designs to go to the toilet in your space suit, but it had to be a hands-free"
00:27:18,00:27:23,"in-suit toilet device, right, which could work for up to six days."
00:27:23,00:27:30,"The main winner, and I don't know the full details, but it was a small, crotch-based airlock."
00:27:30,00:27:33,Okay.
00:27:33,00:27:34,It's a poo-through.
00:27:34,00:27:41,"Well, I don't think that's the answer, but you could apparently stick things in through"
00:27:41,00:27:44,"it, which I do not understand either."
00:27:44,00:27:45,I see what it is.
00:27:45,00:27:49,"So it sort of hangs off your bum, and then you press a button, and it opens it, and you"
00:27:49,00:27:50,"throw into it, and then you press a button."
00:27:50,00:27:51,"Wait, no, it's on the crotch."
00:27:51,00:27:52,It's on the crotch.
00:27:52,00:27:56,It's a bit like a burrito working.
00:27:56,00:28:01,"It happens is the poo goes in one side like a burrito, and then closes up, and then someone"
00:28:01,00:28:04,"opens the other side, and then takes a burrito out."
00:28:04,00:28:05,"Oh, okay."
00:28:05,00:28:06,Oh.
00:28:06,00:28:07,Not eating it.
00:28:07,00:28:09,You're Mexican restaurant.
00:28:09,00:28:13,"Well, the Sussan United Goldkeeper said it was very nice."
00:28:13,00:28:14,Oh.
00:28:14,00:28:16,"Anyway, yeah, I'm sorry."
00:28:16,00:28:19,"I don't fully understand the designs of the winner, but there were three winners."
00:28:19,00:28:25,"One was that one, the second place was, it's just words here, an air push, urinary girdle."
00:28:25,00:28:26,I don't know.
00:28:26,00:28:28,The third place was kind of an external catheter thing.
00:28:28,00:28:29,Okay.
00:28:29,00:28:30,Yeah.
00:28:30,00:28:36,"Actually, on air locks, non-feesy space, the new space suit that they're designing now, and"
00:28:36,00:28:39,"they're hoping to get out before they have to cancel all these missions, it's going"
00:28:39,00:28:45,"to cost $4.4 million, and one of the most important innovations on it is that it has"
00:28:45,00:28:50,"got what's called a suit plate interface port, which basically, it means that you don't"
00:28:50,00:28:53,"have to go through an airlock anymore to leave the spaceship, because you just dock into"
00:28:53,00:28:54,your suit.
00:28:54,00:28:58,"So the suit is docked to the outside of the spaceship, and then you just walk into your"
00:28:58,00:28:59,suit.
00:28:59,00:29:00,No.
00:29:00,00:29:02,"And then you don't have to, like, go through, because you usually have to go through an"
00:29:02,00:29:06,"airlock, dock onto the floor, go through an airlock, and then go into the space station"
00:29:06,00:29:07,where that is.
00:29:07,00:29:09,It doesn't sound like a good idea.
00:29:09,00:29:10,Cool.
00:29:10,00:29:14,"That's like, why don't you change into your scuba gear underwater?"
00:29:14,00:29:18,"So if something goes wrong, if anything goes wrong in space, and you're exposed to the vacuum"
00:29:18,00:29:21,"of space, you're dead in seconds, you'd have a couple of minutes."
00:29:21,00:29:22,Yeah.
00:29:22,00:29:23,"Come on, Dad."
00:29:23,00:29:24,What?
00:29:24,00:29:25,Chill out.
00:29:25,00:29:26,A couple of minutes to put a suit.
00:29:26,00:29:27,They're really good.
00:29:27,00:29:28,They take some about 45 minutes to put those suits on.
00:29:28,00:29:32,"Is the space suit part of the outside of the ship, though?"
00:29:32,00:29:33,No.
00:29:33,00:29:35,"So I don't think it's like, you put it on, and then there's just a big hole in the ship"
00:29:35,00:29:36,as you leave.
00:29:36,00:29:37,No.
00:29:37,00:29:38,What?
00:29:38,00:29:39,Whoops.
00:29:39,00:29:43,But it doesn't bury a clothes behind the suit.
00:29:43,00:29:44,I'm not sure.
00:29:44,00:29:45,So this is what the woman said to design them.
00:29:45,00:29:51,She said it allows astronauts to enter and exit the outfit by docking with the vehicle.
00:29:51,00:29:55,"So I'm not sure exactly how it would work, but I'm sure they've worked out a way of sealing"
00:29:55,00:29:56,the vehicle behind them.
00:29:56,00:29:57,Mm.
00:29:57,00:29:58,I think that's pretty cool.
00:29:58,00:29:59,You would hope.
00:29:59,00:30:00,That's not cool.
00:30:00,00:30:01,Yeah.
00:30:01,00:30:06,"I was reading a thing about-- so in the news of the last few weeks, Peggy Witson, who is"
00:30:06,00:30:09,"the commander of the International Space Station, she broke the record for the longest"
00:30:09,00:30:11,"time, and American has been in space."
00:30:11,00:30:16,"She already holds a number of other records for being in space, and she's commanding it"
00:30:16,00:30:18,for the second time as well.
00:30:18,00:30:23,"And she's an amazing person, and they did a broadcast between the International Space"
00:30:23,00:30:28,"Station and the White House, the Oval Office, so Trump and Ivanka and another astronaut--"
00:30:28,00:30:29,Why was Ivanka there?
00:30:29,00:30:30,She was everywhere.
00:30:30,00:30:31,Why?
00:30:31,00:30:32,She's pretty important.
00:30:32,00:30:35,She was going to fly the thing.
00:30:35,00:30:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:36,00:30:37,Yeah.
00:30:37,00:30:43,"So there was a chat that was going on between them, and you could see both at the same time."
00:30:43,00:30:47,"And there was this moment, which they were a bit confused about, and they're not sure if"
00:30:47,00:30:48,Trump was joking.
00:30:48,00:30:50,"They were talking, but he said, ""When are we going to get to Mars?"""
00:30:50,00:30:55,"And Peggy said, ""Well, you know, we're doing all these amazing bits of research up here"
00:30:55,00:31:00,"and down on Earth, and we think by 2030s we could start getting to it."""
00:31:00,00:31:03,"And he said, ""No, I think we need to do it in my first term."
00:31:03,00:31:07,"It'd be disappointing if it was in my second term, but that's still OK."""
00:31:07,00:31:10,"And so she was like, ""Ha-ha-ha."""
00:31:10,00:31:13,"And then people at NASA were like, ""Was that like a JFK moment?"""
00:31:13,00:31:14,Did he mean that?
00:31:14,00:31:17,And we have to get to Mars in three years.
00:31:17,00:31:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:18,00:31:24,"So yeah, I don't know, but we've got nothing to worry."
00:31:24,00:31:29,"It was a weird broadcast, because at points, I watched most of it, Trump just suddenly gets"
00:31:29,00:31:30,bored.
00:31:30,00:31:33,It just looks quite bored talking to astronauts in space.
00:31:33,00:31:36,"And he also looks like he's thinking, ""I wonder what studio in Hollywood they're filming"
00:31:36,00:31:37,"this in?"""
00:31:37,00:31:42,"Like, I imagine he's a moon landing denier, and he just thinks, ""Yeah, you're not there,"
00:31:42,00:31:43,are you?
00:31:43,00:31:44,I know.
00:31:44,00:31:45,"I know about you guys."""
00:31:45,00:31:46,"They actually discussed the urine thing, didn't they?"
00:31:46,00:31:47,He asked about how you eat.
00:31:47,00:31:49,"Wait, which, the Trump urine thing or the astronaut urine thing?"
00:31:49,00:31:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:50,00:31:55,"He probably actually might have lied in his answer given that, because they discussed the"
00:31:55,00:31:56,astronaut urine thing.
00:31:56,00:31:59,"They avoided the Trump urine thing, actually."
00:31:59,00:32:04,"And about the recycling the urine, so they drink recycled urine when they're up in space."
00:32:04,00:32:07,"And she said to him, ""It's really not as bad as it sounds."""
00:32:07,00:32:08,"And he said, ""Well, that's good."
00:32:08,00:32:09,Glad to hear it.
00:32:09,00:32:10,"Better use than me."""
00:32:10,00:32:14,"So one of the problems is that with these suits, the ones that are breaking."
00:32:14,00:32:20,So one of the ones that broke not too long ago started letting the water supply and the
00:32:20,00:32:23,astronaut potentially could have drowned inside his own suit.
00:32:23,00:32:26,They had to get immediately back into the International Space Station and take all the
00:32:26,00:32:27,stuff off.
00:32:27,00:32:33,"So the big problem is, as soon as something goes wrong inside the suit, taking the astronaut"
00:32:33,00:32:37,"out of the suit in time to save them, it does take a super long time."
00:32:37,00:32:38,Wow.
00:32:38,00:32:40,I'm really surprised it takes so long to make them.
00:32:40,00:32:47,"You would think, like, okay, we need one before 2024, it can't be beyond the realm of"
00:32:47,00:32:48,mud to be able to do that.
00:32:48,00:32:49,That's true.
00:32:49,00:32:52,"If you have a million quid, you would think you'd be able to do it."
00:32:52,00:32:53,I don't know.
00:32:53,00:32:56,"From Kennedy announcing, we're going to go to the moon to get to the moon."
00:32:56,00:32:57,It was about nine years.
00:32:57,00:33:00,We're now saying that it'll take us roughly that long to make a suit.
00:33:00,00:33:04,"Well, we're getting a Mars in three years, so it's actually good."
00:33:04,00:33:07,No one's going to have any suits on.
00:33:07,00:33:11,Mars mission ends in immediate disaster.
00:33:11,00:33:18,No one could have foreseen as they stepped out.
00:33:18,00:33:25,"Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show."
00:33:25,00:33:27,That is Tzizinski.
00:33:27,00:33:32,"Yes, my fact that I would like to get into the news book is that, as of last week, whenever"
00:33:32,00:33:38,"state media in Tajikistan mentions the president, they now legally have to refer to him by his"
00:33:38,00:33:43,"full title, which is, ""The founder of peace and national unity, leader of the nation,"
00:33:43,00:33:48,"president of the Republic of Tajikistan, his excellency, Emma Marley-Raman."""
00:33:48,00:33:50,And they have to do that every time they mention him.
00:33:50,00:33:57,"What can they cough after it and say, ""Wanker!"""
00:33:57,00:34:01,So I think this might be the only news book that comes out this year that has a full section
00:34:01,00:34:02,on Tajikistan.
00:34:02,00:34:05,So get it for that.
00:34:05,00:34:06,Wow.
00:34:06,00:34:11,"Apparently, it takes 15 seconds for it to scroll along the screen on the news."
00:34:11,00:34:15,"Which is if you're trying to show a news bulletin, the president's announced, 15 seconds is"
00:34:15,00:34:17,a long time to have one name scrolling for.
00:34:17,00:34:22,"But apparently you're allowed to say, ""Leader of the nation,"" like if it's really a short"
00:34:22,00:34:23,"bulletin or something, you're allowed to call it."
00:34:23,00:34:24,It does nice.
00:34:24,00:34:25,"It's nice to be in full, isn't it?"
00:34:25,00:34:27,"Please, just call me ""Leader of the nation."""
00:34:27,00:34:29,"Well, they've speculated."
00:34:29,00:34:34,"I think this is something the BBC picked up, and it was reported by Radio Azad-Lic."
00:34:34,00:34:38,"And it was the director of Tajik State Radio, who made the announcement."
00:34:38,00:34:43,"And he just said, ""The mandatory use of the full title is required by law and didn't"
00:34:43,00:34:44,"elaborate."""
00:34:44,00:34:47,"So I think, unless I think we're still just speculating going, ""I think you're"
00:34:47,00:34:51,"probably okay if you say, ""Leader of the nation"" sometimes, we'll only find out when someone"
00:34:51,00:34:52,tries it.
00:34:52,00:34:53,Yep.
00:34:53,00:34:59,"So Emma Marley-Ramon, the president of Tajik Stan, has been, say his full name, sorry,"
00:34:59,00:35:07,"the founder of the National University, he is a very undemocratic guy."
00:35:07,00:35:11,"As in, in May last year, he made people vote over whether he should be president of the"
00:35:11,00:35:12,life.
00:35:12,00:35:13,He won remarkably.
00:35:13,00:35:14,That's not undemocratic.
00:35:14,00:35:15,"No, you're right."
00:35:15,00:35:18,He won 94.5% of the vote.
00:35:18,00:35:19,"Well, they like him."
00:35:19,00:35:20,Yeah.
00:35:20,00:35:21,They'd better.
00:35:21,00:35:24,"Because there's a lot of human rights repression, a lot of torture and things like this."
00:35:24,00:35:25,Yeah.
00:35:25,00:35:30,They're 149th out of 180 on the free press listing.
00:35:30,00:35:31,Wow.
00:35:31,00:35:32,So pretty low down.
00:35:32,00:35:33,Yeah.
00:35:33,00:35:37,"And he's passed a law which gives him immunity from all criminal charges for life, which"
00:35:37,00:35:43,"is exactly the sort of thing that you normal, honest guys always tend to dig."
00:35:43,00:35:44,Yeah.
00:35:44,00:35:45,It does.
00:35:45,00:35:49,"So he's banned a few things generally that I've just got, obviously he's done that if he's"
00:35:49,00:35:53,making news outlets call him by that full name.
00:35:53,00:35:56,One thing he's blocked is YouTube.
00:35:56,00:36:01,"YouTube not allowed there anymore, mainly because of a video that went online of him dancing"
00:36:01,00:36:06,drunkenly at a wedding and singing karaoke really badly.
00:36:06,00:36:07,Yeah.
00:36:07,00:36:09,"So he said, okay, this needs to be banned."
00:36:09,00:36:11,So he's banned the whole website.
00:36:11,00:36:12,YouTube.
00:36:12,00:36:13,Yes.
00:36:13,00:36:20,"People would do that if I had the power, there'd be no Facebook, no YouTube."
00:36:20,00:36:21,Pretty much nothing.
00:36:21,00:36:23,"No, it's not all banning things that he does."
00:36:23,00:36:26,We should say he has taken a lot of positive steps too.
00:36:26,00:36:32,"So policing to Tiki's down, I've been told that they have to go to the theatre once a month,"
00:36:32,00:36:33,but on different days.
00:36:33,00:36:35,So there isn't one incredibly large audience on one day.
00:36:35,00:36:38,I don't know how they coordinate all going on different days.
00:36:38,00:36:41,"If they all go on the same day, there's going to be no police around."
00:36:41,00:36:42,That's true.
00:36:42,00:36:47,"Mark me in that one theatre, imagine your bad luck if you go to rob that theatre."
00:36:47,00:36:52,I could have literally robbed anyone else in the country.
00:36:52,00:36:56,But it's meant to be to help their spiritual and moral awareness and there is a photo going
00:36:56,00:37:01,with the news story of these incredibly bored looking men in suits.
00:37:01,00:37:02,Yeah.
00:37:02,00:37:07,It is just because though the interior minister who's called Ramazon Rahim Zoda just went
00:37:07,00:37:11,"to the theatre last month and said, oh my god, this is really fun."
00:37:11,00:37:12,I like this.
00:37:12,00:37:14,"And so said, I think everyone should do it."
00:37:14,00:37:16,"He just went, I thought it was good, thought they should do it too."
00:37:16,00:37:17,I quite like that.
00:37:17,00:37:19,Imagine if everything Theresa May didn't enjoy it.
00:37:19,00:37:21,We all then had to do.
00:37:21,00:37:22,Would that be good?
00:37:22,00:37:23,"Oh, we're all going fuck Sunsini."
00:37:23,00:37:26,Come on guys.
00:37:26,00:37:32,"He, another thing that he has put in place as a ban is that so everywhere in Tajikistan"
00:37:32,00:37:35,"there are pictures of him, giant billboard pictures of him."
00:37:35,00:37:41,"And he's ordered that in all of the smaller towns and cities, any mayor or anyone in"
00:37:41,00:37:46,the position of power there has to take down the picture if they're in it with him because
00:37:46,00:37:51,"he doesn't want to be associated with giving them the publicity of friendship on, yeah."
00:37:51,00:37:56,"So he said, and the way that they did it was, they called up all the local officials on"
00:37:56,00:38:00,"the phone and they said, hi, are you the local official?"
00:38:00,00:38:01,"Yes, I am."
00:38:01,00:38:06,I have a message here from the president and then they played a voice recording of him
00:38:06,00:38:10,"down the phone line to them where he says, you are no longer allowed to have my photo"
00:38:10,00:38:12,up if you're in the photo with me.
00:38:12,00:38:15,And so it's an audio message they played down the phone to each person that they called
00:38:15,00:38:16,up.
00:38:16,00:38:17,It's embarrassing.
00:38:17,00:38:18,That's so weird.
00:38:18,00:38:23,"It's a bit like when you split up with your ex, but you kind of like the photo so you kind"
00:38:23,00:38:25,"of get rid of them from the photo, isn't it?"
00:38:25,00:38:26,Right.
00:38:26,00:38:27,Yes.
00:38:27,00:38:31,Or when you call up their best friend and you play a recording of yourself down the phone
00:38:31,00:38:35,"at them saying, I want my stereo back."
00:38:35,00:38:41,I want the canvas with the CD.
00:38:41,00:38:45,"And it's like that, do you remember during the coup in Turkey, President Erdogan appeared"
00:38:45,00:38:48,"on TV, but it wasn't him appearing on TV."
00:38:48,00:38:52,It was someone holding up a phone on the camera while they were mid-skipping him.
00:38:52,00:38:53,Yeah.
00:38:53,00:38:56,"That's not actually one other thing that we'll probably go in the book is Melanchor, just"
00:38:56,00:38:59,speaking of people appearing in weird technological ways.
00:38:59,00:39:03,"Melanchor, who was voted out of the French election the first round, but was the very left"
00:39:03,00:39:04,wing candidate.
00:39:04,00:39:08,"It was appearing by holograms, so he was appearing in seven or eight states at once."
00:39:08,00:39:11,But it wasn't even a hologram found out.
00:39:11,00:39:13,"It was a, what was it called?"
00:39:13,00:39:14,Hepers Ghost.
00:39:14,00:39:17,"It was called Peppers Ghost, which is a cool or name than hologram."
00:39:17,00:39:20,"So he's like, he's like Tupac."
00:39:20,00:39:21,Yeah.
00:39:21,00:39:22,Exactly.
00:39:22,00:39:23,Tupac did the same thing.
00:39:23,00:39:25,"And it basically means you appear in a similar way, but it's two-dimensional, whereas"
00:39:25,00:39:26,a hologram is three-dimensional.
00:39:26,00:39:27,But it's basically a hologram.
00:39:27,00:39:28,It's not a hologram.
00:39:28,00:39:29,"Yeah, but it looks like one."
00:39:29,00:39:32,It doesn't understand what I'm saying when I say it's basically that.
00:39:32,00:39:36,"Yeah, but you know what I'm saying when I say Montereyl, but it's a hyperloop."
00:39:36,00:39:37,Yeah.
00:39:37,00:39:40,I think we're going to turn each other.
00:39:40,00:39:41,"Oh, I just know."
00:39:41,00:39:42,It's got very tense.
00:39:42,00:39:46,"I'm just saying maybe if he used a hologram, he might have got to the second round."
00:39:46,00:39:51,Melanchol did campaign partly via computer game.
00:39:51,00:39:52,What?
00:39:52,00:39:53,What?
00:39:53,00:39:56,"What, like infiltrated Diddy Kong racing again?"
00:39:56,00:39:57,Like in Minecraft.
00:39:57,00:39:59,"No, his supporters."
00:39:59,00:40:04,"He was quite tech savvy, and it didn't as much good as it could have done, but his supporters"
00:40:04,00:40:11,developed a computer game called Fiscal Combat with a sort of K-lack in Mortal Combat.
00:40:11,00:40:15,"And you played Melanchol in it, and you had to go around finding businessmen and then"
00:40:15,00:40:17,shaking them up and down.
00:40:17,00:40:18,Right.
00:40:18,00:40:21,"And as you shook them up and down, their coins flew out of their pockets, and you were taking"
00:40:21,00:40:22,tax from the wealthy.
00:40:22,00:40:24,It doesn't sound fun to me.
00:40:24,00:40:25,I've played it.
00:40:25,00:40:26,It is quite fun.
00:40:26,00:40:29,Because it's exactly that 2D style.
00:40:29,00:40:30,It's pretty good.
00:40:30,00:40:34,"I mean, James, you're the only person left alive still playing Pokemon Go, so I don't"
00:40:34,00:40:36,know if you're a good arbiter of what is fun.
00:40:36,00:40:42,"Well, I'm going to be trying to get some Pokemon Go facts into this book."
00:40:42,00:40:44,We were almost late just for the listeners.
00:40:44,00:40:49,"We were almost late to the meeting for our book deal, because we thought James was in charge"
00:40:49,00:40:52,of the Google Maps leading us the way to the building.
00:40:52,00:40:56,"But in fact, we were following a man chasing Dad Pokemon."
00:40:56,00:40:57,We got the book.
00:40:57,00:41:00,The alumni got an onyx.
00:41:00,00:41:04,"Something about elections in Tajikistan, actually, which is quite interesting."
00:41:04,00:41:09,"You can run for opposition, but there was no real proper opposition in the last election."
00:41:09,00:41:14,"The closest person who came to being a proper opponent was someone called Oynahol Bob-Zerova,"
00:41:14,00:41:16,which is a cool name.
00:41:16,00:41:21,So what you have to do to be eligible to run as a candidate for election in Tajikistan
00:41:21,00:41:27,"is you need to get 210,000 signatures to be eligible to run."
00:41:27,00:41:30,So let's just put this in context to remind you how the British system works.
00:41:30,00:41:35,"In the UK, you need to get 10 signatures to be a candidate for election here, just 10"
00:41:35,00:41:37,signatures to be your consistency.
00:41:37,00:41:42,"In the US, if you want to run for Senate, you need between 1 and 2,000, I think, in most places."
00:41:42,00:41:49,"Sorry, between 1,000 and 2,000, or between 1 and 2,000, it'll be over 1,000."
00:41:49,00:41:54,"Yeah, and in Tajikistan, which only has a population of 8 million, you need to get one in 40 people"
00:41:54,00:41:58,in the country just saying that you should be a candidate.
00:41:58,00:42:01,"And she still managed to get 202,000."
00:42:01,00:42:03,"And she was 8,000,000 sure."
00:42:03,00:42:04,Oh my god.
00:42:04,00:42:05,That is nuts.
00:42:05,00:42:06,I think I'd fudge a few.
00:42:06,00:42:07,Yeah.
00:42:07,00:42:08,"I mean, I'd duplicate a few."
00:42:08,00:42:12,I think you might get you in trouble with this guy.
00:42:12,00:42:14,But I'm not going to check the mall.
00:42:14,00:42:15,He's taking a linear view of it.
00:42:15,00:42:16,I'm sure.
00:42:16,00:42:18,"Isn't that such a slap on my face, though?"
00:42:18,00:42:20,She's a super cool woman.
00:42:20,00:42:21,Look her up.
00:42:21,00:42:25,"She won a wall given by Michelle Obama last year or the year before, like, most influential,"
00:42:25,00:42:27,good women in the world or something.
00:42:27,00:42:28,"Oh, really?"
00:42:28,00:42:29,"But yeah, hard luck on her."
00:42:29,00:42:30,Yeah.
00:42:30,00:42:36,Tajikistan has the cheapest pint of beer in the world that you can buy.
00:42:36,00:42:37,Really?
00:42:37,00:42:38,How much is it?
00:42:38,00:42:39,"30p, per pint."
00:42:39,00:42:40,That's pretty good.
00:42:40,00:42:41,"Yeah, 30p."
00:42:41,00:42:42,That's quite good.
00:42:42,00:42:48,"And I think the second cheapest is 36p, which is made by Bhutanese monks."
00:42:48,00:42:50,So that's the next cheapest one.
00:42:50,00:42:51,I think so.
00:42:51,00:42:52,I drunk beer in Bhutan.
00:42:52,00:42:53,I remember it being quite expensive.
00:42:53,00:42:54,You got overcharged late.
00:42:54,00:42:55,You found it all night.
00:42:55,00:42:56,Sorry.
00:42:56,00:42:57,They saw you coming.
00:42:57,00:43:00,"I'm pretty sure it was expensive, actually."
00:43:00,00:43:01,Maybe only one?
00:43:01,00:43:02,Six quid for a pint.
00:43:02,00:43:03,Yeah.
00:43:03,00:43:04,Sorry.
00:43:04,00:43:08,We have to bring him for Tajikistan.
00:43:08,00:43:15,"Another thing Tajikistan has, which is kind of cool, is the world's most dangerous tunnel."
00:43:15,00:43:16,Yeah.
00:43:16,00:43:19,That sounds awesome.
00:43:19,00:43:21,"That sounds kind of cool, I'd say."
00:43:21,00:43:23,I did say kind of.
00:43:23,00:43:24,In what way?
00:43:24,00:43:26,And who decides that it's the most dangerous?
00:43:26,00:43:27,I think just the general public.
00:43:27,00:43:29,"So it's nicknamed death tunnel, I think."
00:43:29,00:43:34,"And the reason it was built, it was built in, I think it was started being built in 2007."
00:43:34,00:43:38,And the reason it was built was because before that you couldn't drive from North to South
00:43:38,00:43:41,Tajikistan without having to cut through it as Bekastan.
00:43:41,00:43:44,"And as Bekastan, it's not very friendly to Tajikistan a lot."
00:43:44,00:43:48,"So actually quite a dangerous trip, if you have to go visit your mum in the north, to go"
00:43:48,00:43:49,there.
00:43:49,00:43:50,So they built this tunnel.
00:43:50,00:43:51,It's five kilometres long.
00:43:51,00:43:57,"And it opened up a few years ago, but it had no lighting, so it's pitch dark in there."
00:43:57,00:44:01,"It's got massive potholes, it has falling rocks all over the place."
00:44:01,00:44:04,And you actually have to sign a form before you go into the tunnel saying that you understand
00:44:04,00:44:09,"the danger of driving through this tunnel, of being hit by falling rocks or something."
00:44:09,00:44:11,It's got no ventilation at all.
00:44:11,00:44:14,"Oh, I think it's got maybe one fan right in the middle."
00:44:14,00:44:18,"And so that means that it's filled with exhaust fumes, so visibility is only a few feet."
00:44:18,00:44:22,"And this does mean that if you break down, for instance, in the middle of it, you will"
00:44:22,00:44:26,get carbon monoxide poisoning within a very short amount of time.
00:44:26,00:44:29,So people who are driving through this tunnel say they get dizzy and nauseous as they do
00:44:29,00:44:34,"it, because it's so blocked up with carbon monoxide."
00:44:34,00:44:40,But it is a great way to get from North to South Tajikistan.
00:44:40,00:44:41,"How long is it, sorry?"
00:44:41,00:44:42,Five kilometres.
00:44:42,00:44:43,Five kilometres.
00:44:43,00:44:44,That is quite a long way.
00:44:44,00:44:45,It's a long way.
00:44:45,00:44:46,It's a long way to go.
00:44:46,00:44:47,It's a long way to go.
00:44:47,00:44:48,It's a long way to go.
00:44:48,00:44:49,It's a long way to go.
00:44:49,00:44:50,It's a long way to go.
00:44:50,00:44:51,It's a long way to go.
00:44:51,00:44:52,It's a long way to go.
00:44:52,00:44:53,It's a long way to go.
00:44:53,00:44:54,It's a long way to go.
00:44:54,00:44:55,It's a long way to go.
00:44:55,00:44:56,It's a long way to go.
00:44:56,00:44:57,I think they are improving it.
00:44:57,00:44:58,There was a thing last year when they said they like it.
