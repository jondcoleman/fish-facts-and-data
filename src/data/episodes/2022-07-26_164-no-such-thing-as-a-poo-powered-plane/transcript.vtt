00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.240
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.400
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.280
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.200
 Anna Chazinski, and once again we've gathered around the microphone only this time, we've

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.280
 got a big announcement to make right at the top of this show. We are releasing our first

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.400
 ever book. I forgot to mention that to you, actually.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.960
 One of the last to know everything in this episode.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.160
 You're not involved.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.880
 So yeah, No Such Thing as a Fish, we're releasing a book, we've signed a deal, and the book

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.680
 is being released in November. If you're hearing these words, you can pre-order it now.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.160
 Go to Amazon and click the button, it's a book that click the button, it's a Amazon.com

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.240
 and click the button. It's on the front page.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.240
 It's on the front page.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.320
 It's on the middle of the page saying, "By the fish book now."

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.040
 I think what you want to do is go to qi.com/shop, and we're going to have a link there that

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.160
 you click on, which will take you to the page where you can pre-order the book. And it's

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.480
 going to be called the book of the year, and it's going to be about the year that's happening

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.720
 right now, and it's by us, go to Amazon, or go to qi.com/shop, and you'll be able to pre-order

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.720
 it.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.360
 Yeah, and it's going to be packed with all the most interesting stories that we found from

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.520
 2017. This is one that I want to get into the book. Mafia members in Sicily have been banned

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.720
 from becoming godfathers. So this is an archbishop who has said that at baptisms, if you are involved

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.240
 in the mafia, you are now not allowed to become a godfather.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.280
 This is one that I've got, when they voted for the UK general election, there was only 13

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.440
 MPs that didn't vote for it, and one of them did it because it was going to interfere with

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.440
 his honeymoon.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.840
 Okay, this is one that I'd like to get in. This is something that's been revealed in the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.520
 last couple of weeks, and it's that a Norwegian slow TV show that follows my grating reindeer

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.720
 has had to be suspended after the reindeer stopped moving all together.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.720
 I've got the fact that I'd like to get into the book, which is that Jeremy Corbyn has

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.120
 won seven elections for Parliamentary Beard of the Year.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.120
 Wow.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.120
 Really?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.480
 Yeah, and it's practically unparalleled in modern history.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.760
 Is he the current reigning champ?

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.040
 He's the current Labour leader. Yeah, it's depending on when you're listening to this.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.640
 Is that what he spends all his time campaigning for then?

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.400
 Yes, he's supposed all the actual beard of the year, quite a long time ago, I think.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.800
 Yeah, as opposed to the niche Parliamentary beard of the year.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.280
 Yeah, I think that's like qualifying round time.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.560
 I think I'll make the regionals.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.560
 Yeah.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.880
 He made global beard of the year.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.880
 Oh, I think it's British beard.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.880
 It's British beard.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.880
 A British beard of the year.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.880
 I can't.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.040
 He is the reigning champion, yes, and he won, I think, with 64% of the vote last year, which

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.440
 is slightly more than he won that year's leadership contest with.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.480
 When is the next championship?

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.480
 It'll be this year.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.080
 In time for our book, I think it will be in time for the book, so we'll be able to announce

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.000
 whether he's won it a record seven time.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.960
 That's hope so, because if we had a book of news of 2017, we weren't able to get in the

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960
 results of beard of the year.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.960
 It would just be a joke.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.040
 Sorry, I think it'd be Parliamentary beard of the year.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040
 Yeah.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.800
 Yeah, so that's it.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.360
 The book's going to be just packed with all that sort of stuff.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.080
 And we thought we would spend this episode not telling you our most interesting fact

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.600
 that we've learned over the last seven days, strictly from all of history, but we would

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.880
 pick something that we want to go into this book and pitch it to each other.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.440
 So that's what we're going to do, starting with you, Andy.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.720
 My fact that I would like to get into the book is that ideas proposed for the U.S. border

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.880
 wall include a trench full of nuclear waste, a one-way mirror, and three million hammocks

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.880
 next to each other.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.880
 What?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.880
 Three million hammocks?

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.880
 Yeah.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.600
 It's so much a serious proposal, but-- No, because you could just go under them.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.800
 Or over them, depending on how high up the tree they're tied.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.720
 Ah, so they're going to be trees along this border.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.440
 I think it's not a fixed proposal, yeah.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.960
 I think you could plant the trees.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.840
 You'd have to have something to attack the hammocks, too.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.840
 Yeah.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.160
 It's the idea that you get to a hammock.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.160
 It looks so comfortable.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.520
 You lie down, happen that, and you never make it across.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.200
 I think that's the idea, yeah.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.560
 There is an artist whose name is Jennifer Meridian, whose proposed that one she's proposed

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.200
 also a wall of pipe organs and a wall of lighthouses, thousands and thousands of lighthouses.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.400
 So this was a big push, wasn't it, for proposals to be sent in?

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.400
 Yeah.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.440
 So they had a little five-day window where you could submit your proposals, and then they're

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.560
 going to pick around 20 finalists in about a month or so, and they're going to build prototypes

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.600
 of their sections of the wall.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.840
 How are they going to build a prototype of the nuclear waste one?

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.440
 Just a little bit of depleted Uranium.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.440
 Yeah, exactly.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.440
 Yeah.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.440
 I don't know.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.040
 The Mero is a very interesting idea.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040
 Incredible idea.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.120
 You can see Mexico from the USA, but they can't see you.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.120
 Yeah.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.120
 What's the point in that?

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.680
 I have no idea.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.760
 You could still see someone approaching if they were going to try and climb the mirror.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.600
 And you don't know if you're approaching for the Mexican side.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.120
 You don't know if anyone is watching that.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.120
 If you're watching that.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.120
 What's this?

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.120
 Yeah.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.120
 Okay.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.120
 I thought it was just that the Mexicans go to war and go, "Oh no, it's just exactly like

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.120
 here, we might as well say."

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.120
 There are loads of proposals.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.960
 One of them has a monorail going all the way along the top.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960
 Like a hyperloop, they're calling it, right?

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960
 Yeah, but it's a monorail.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.960
 Is it a monorail?

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960
 Yeah, okay.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.960
 What's the difference between those two things?

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.000
 Oh, one sounds super futuristic, and the other sounds like monorail.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Yeah.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.040
 We've all seen that episode of The Simpsons.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:46.440
 I read the rules for the proposals, the idea of what the wall needs to withstand.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.640
 It's, "Nesawidstand attacks from," here's the quote, "Sledgehammer, Carjack, Pickaxe, Chisel,

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.240
 Battery Operated Impact Tools, any kind of handheld tools, and not only does it have

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.720
 to sort of deal with the impacts, but it should be able to deal with it for up to four hours."

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.720
 So specifically--

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.720
 Four hours.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.720
 So it's four hours of a sledgehammer.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.320
 Meanwhile, there's some luck next to you who are the chisel, right?

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.320
 That's it.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.720
 It's like, "Why do you need to specify the chisel when you've also got the car jacker smashing

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.720
 into it?"

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.720
 The four hours.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.720
 We've made it.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.720
 We've made it car jackproof, but there's a chisel weakness of what we're going to do.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720
 It's like the Death Star.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.720
 There's going to be a chisel one.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.720
 A little weak spot.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.160
 So it's a very stupid idea, obviously.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.160
 Yeah.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.760
 And they want it ideally to be 30-foot tall, and so all the proposals had-- so it's a 30-foot

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.760
 tall mirror.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.760
 It's quite cool.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.760
 Wow.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.760
 He's become more flexible on the 30-foot thing.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.760
 Yes.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.760
 I think he's gone.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.760
 He said anything over 18 feet, might be okay.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.760
 18 feet.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.760
 Yeah.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.920
 One of the problems is that they obviously need to build the wall on their side of the land,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.920
 on the American side of the land.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.560
 But there's a lot of American landowners who have houses and property that go on the

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.280
 other side of these rivers and bits of land, generally.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.360
 So to build the wall, he's actually going to be sealing out a lot of Americans, and they're

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.080
 going to be stuck in Mexico unless they sell their land.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.080
 So he's trying to buy the land back from them for the government.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.640
 He knows there's going to be problems.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.240
 So he's planning to effectively go into legal war with a lot of Americans over there.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.240
 So in 2006, they started building a lot of walls at various points, and there were

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:26.680
 442 lawsuits that were reviewed by CNN from the time, and 93 of them are still open.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.680
 Wow.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.320
 And that was for a much shorter wall.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.760
 Was that because also in 2006, I think George Bush approved a virtual wall.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.160
 I think we've talked about the idea of virtual wall before, but he worked on that.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.920
 The project was shelved in 2011, and it cost a billion dollars.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.720
 Sorry, is that a billion real dollars or a billion virtual dollars?

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.120
 It's sadly, I think it's real dollars.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:53.840
 But the thing about the virtual wall was that it worked by a system of censors that was

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.960
 supposed to be able to tell where migrants were crossing the border, but apparently it

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.000
 was really ineffective in windy conditions, in mistook trees and plants for people.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.680
 It was constantly thinking that animals crossing the border represent a suspicious

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.680
 activity.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.680
 Right.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.560
 One person has proposed leaving a four-inch gap at the bottom of the wall, so that little

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.080
 animals can cross.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.600
 One problem is that there are 111 species, which cross the area currently proposed for the

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.600
 wall, and so lots of them will struggle to mate and breed and live a full, fulfilling

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.600
 life.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.800
 I wonder if all the animals will then evolve to be four-inch as tall, like tidy buffaloes

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.480
 going over the range.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.480
 I've got an idea.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.480
 What about this?

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:43.680
 You kind of make a very slight incline from about two miles out, and it just gets more and

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.000
 more incline, incline, incline, incline.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.240
 And then on the Mexican side, it's a sheer drop.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.240
 Do you know what I mean?

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240
 Like a cliff.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.520
 So from the American side, it just looks like a normal bit of like a har-har in an English

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520
 country garden.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.520
 Exactly like that.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.040
 Well, that's a bit like the apparent border between North and South Korea, right?

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.040
 Really?

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.960
 So about North Korea claims there's a wall dividing it from South Korea, and that the

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.880
 US and South Korea built this wall a few decades ago during the Cold War.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.200
 And they say on their side, it's got like little crenellations where guns are, and it's got

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.160
 checkpoints along it, and it's this big wall.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.120
 And then it says on the other side, on the South Korea side, it's just covered in turf

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.120
 and grass.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.680
 And so nobody knows that it's there from the other side.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.280
 And the US and South Korea totally deny that they ever built this wall.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:35.000
 But there's evidence, someone did a documentary, I think, where they claim to be showing pictures.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.920
 So we've got no idea if North Korea is divided from South Korea by a wall.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.680
 I saw a photo of, because there are doors on the border where the North Koreans and South

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.040
 Koreans have police, and they open up to either let people in.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.200
 And when they open up the door, if it's a police officer opening the door on the South Korean

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.680
 side, the rule is, is that another South Korean officer has to be holding onto them, because

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.960
 they might be pulled through by the North Koreans.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.120
 There's photos you can see online where they're like holding like by the arm, another South

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.920
 Korean police officer opening a door.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.920
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.920
 That's so funny.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:13.880
 Do you know the first ever demarcation between America and Mexico when they first decided to

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.880
 do it?

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.880
 They just drew a line.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.880
 Really?

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.880
 Yeah, drew it.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.880
 Just drew a line on the floor.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.880
 What?

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.880
 Really?

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.880
 It's a pretty one.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.480
 You know, like in old sitcoms where you would draw a line around half of the house and

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.320
 you'd draw a lot on your side and you'd draw that on the floor.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.840
 What was the marker pen?

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.200
 I don't know what it was with.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.680
 I guess it was just a line on the sand.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.680
 It's probably right.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.680
 It's a bit sandy.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.680
 Yeah.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.680
 Well, that's true.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.680
 Well, you can't paint sand.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.680
 You can't paint sand.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.680
 You can't paint sand.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.680
 Well, you can move the line.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.680
 You can move the line.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.680
 It's just quite handy.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.480
 Our country looks a bit smaller today.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.440
 And then they just started making fences.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.800
 And the reason they made fences is because they didn't want Mexican animals to go into

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.800
 American territory because they had like diseases and stuff like that.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.800
 Really?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.800
 Yeah.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.800
 So it wasn't for people.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.040
 And when they made it for people even, it wasn't stop Mexicans from coming in.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.000
 It was to stop Chinese immigrants from coming in.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Really?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 Yeah.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.200
 So was that like start of the 20th century or something?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.400
 It was during the Depression, I think.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.400
 So yeah.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.400
 Right, yeah, OK.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:20.400
 So last week, Congress approved spending for replacing existing fencing.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.600
 Different building, a new wall, there's a strong argument that this is never going to happen.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.200
 So they approved spending to replace existing fencing along 20 miles, which is 1% of the

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.800
 border, and to add gates to existing barriers, apparently.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:39.200
 So it'll be, I think, slightly more porous the border than before because it'll have gates.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.200
 But anyway, Sean Spicer got into a matter of row at the press because he was saying, look

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.800
 at this great wall, and everyone said, hang on, that stuff was a fence when you described

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.800
 it in January.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.520
 It's literally exactly the same structure you were calling it a fence.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.000
 And he said, no, it's a wall, it's definitely a wall.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 He got really touchy about it.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 That's clever, though.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.400
 It probably cost a lot less to just have a chat with the OED and bribe them to change the

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.400
 definition of the wall.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.400
 A wall to a line of paint in the sand.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.800
 But if you just do like they did with their north and south career thing and just say there's

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:14.400
 a wall there, when there isn't a wall there, I don't think that's beyond Trump's.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.400
 You're right.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.400
 He can do it.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.400
 He can do it.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.400
 Yeah.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.600
 All he has to do is say, hey guys, we did it.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.600
 We made a wall.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.000
 And everyone goes, there's no wall here.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 He's like, yeah, there is.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 Yeah.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 What do you want about it?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 You're a wall.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.960
 There was a design that someone came up with in 2009.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.960
 So well before Trump was even thinking about being a candidate, which was a barrier, which

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.680
 is lined with burrito carts.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:44.080
 So it's a proper wall and barrier, but along the ground, like those desks you have to meet

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.680
 people in prisons to visit them so you can have a bit of conversation with them.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.680
 Yeah.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.600
 So there's a barrier there, which is permeable, you can see through it and you can pass things

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.600
 through it.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.600
 Burritos.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.600
 And you can pass burritos through.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.360
 And he said, who's passing to who?

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.840
 I imagine you're selling burritos.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.240
 Probably the burrito seller to the burrito buyer.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.240
 Yeah.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.240
 OK.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.240
 But it can go both ways.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.240
 Yeah, because money could go the other direction.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.240
 Exactly.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.880
 Or if you wanted to sell hot dogs in the other direction, you could do that.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.880
 Yeah.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.880
 OK.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.480
 It's called Ronald Rail, and he said the burrito wall accommodates for a food cart to be inserted

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.200
 into the wall.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:23.600
 Seating is built into the wall and food, conversation or a buy national game of footsie can occur across

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.600
 the border.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.600
 Wait a minute.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.080
 So you can play footsie.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.160
 So maybe that's that four-inch gap, you can.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.160
 Yeah.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.960
 But you know, there is like, there is an existing wall in various parts, of course.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.960
 Yeah.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.360
 And over there, they sometimes play volleyball.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.360
 No.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:43.680
 Historically, they have, yeah. And they'll sometimes have poetry competitions like rap battles.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.680
 Wow.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.680
 But volleyball, you wouldn't be able to see which way the bull was going until it was on

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.680
 your side of the wall.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.240
 That's why the Americans won a one-way mirror.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.160
 That's the winner of volleyball.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.160
 Not really.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.960
 It hasn't touched the ground all the way here.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:11.640
 Okay, it is time to move on to fact number two and that is James.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.640
 Okay.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:18.840
 I think we might have some North Korean stuff in this book, in this book of 2017, very much

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840
 in the news.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.080
 And so here's my North Korea fact.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:28.840
 North Korea's national airline, Koreo, owns 10 times more taxis than it owns aeroplanes.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.840
 Taxis?

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.840
 Yeah.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.080
 They only have 15 aeroplanes.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.280
 And I found that they've recently branched out into taxis.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.200
 And I found that they have about 150 taxis.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.560
 And what we think might have happened is there's a lot of sanctions, obviously, against North

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.560
 Korea.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.160
 So they're not allowed to fly to as many places as they used to be.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.840
 So they need to find other ways to make money and one of the ways they're doing it is branching

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:58.040
 out into things like soda and cigarettes and, in this case, taxis.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.520
 And this is quite a famous airline, isn't it?

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:06.240
 Because they're famously rated one star, they're the only one star airline in the world.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.240
 Yeah.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.840
 But not for danger, for quality of service, which is important to emphasize.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.120
 I think there's only been one fatal accident on Air Koreo and that was 1983.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.680
 That was a car crash.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:27.320
 That was at a time when the airline was called KAC, so CWAK, I suspect that's how you pronounce

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.320
 it.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.320
 But yeah, it's perfectly safe.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.600
 The service is very bad.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:39.640
 Do they have a drag people off planes who've got a perfectly legal ticket?

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.400
 But the Inflight Entertainment sounds like fun.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.400
 Oh yeah.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:50.280
 You get patriotic songs sung by the band Moran Bong.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.240
 And I looked into Moran Bong a bit more, and he actually put them together, Kim Jong-un.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.560
 Did he like the Simon Cowell of North Korea?

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.560
 Yes.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:04.400
 No, he put them together, and they are 20 members, and they're all young women, and they're

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.640
 all quite senior military ranks as well.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.800
 So sometimes they perform in uniform, and sometimes they perform in mini skirts and

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.800
 high heels.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.800
 Well, multi-talented.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.800
 Yeah.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:19.120
 You don't want to get the wrong costume when you're going to wild, are you?

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.840
 Although there was that military march in North Korea a couple of years ago, which showed

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.760
 the female soldiers marching, and they were all wearing really high heels.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.760
 Do you remember?

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.760
 Oh yeah, yeah.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.760
 Yeah.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.640
 You've got to appreciate, because it's quite hard to walk in high heels, isn't it?

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.640
 Yeah.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.680
 If you can march in them, then they're good soldiers.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.480
 I think that's quite a good policy.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.480
 You're right.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.560
 Because if you can do well in high heels, then you're definitely going to do okay in your

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.560
 tragedy.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:50.080
 But they've got songs, sorry, to be obsessed with Moran Bong, but the tracks they say include.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.280
 Let's support our supreme commander with arms.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.760
 We think of the martial day and night, the martialist Kim Jong-un.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.960
 They also play the theme from Rocky, and my way.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.960
 Oh, really?

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.120
 But with the original lyrics, or...

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.120
 I don't know.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.120
 Mmm.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.120
 So.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.880
 Sorry, I feel like I went on an extended route about Moran Bong, though.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.240
 So is it a solid 20 people, or are they sort of on a rotational...

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.240
 No, that's solid.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.520
 And then they disappeared for a while, and then they came back with no explanation.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.520
 Like, take that.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.840
 Take that.

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.560
 So a lot of the news when North Korea has been their missile tests.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.560
 Yeah.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.760
 And their most advanced missile is the Musu Dan.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.320
 That's the Musu Dan, not the Musu Comet Dan, this is the Musu Dan.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:40.680
 And they've done eight attempts, and it's failed six times, okay?

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:48.240
 So that's a 75% failure, which is a worse failure percentage than Sunderland have had.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.960
 Sunderland have failed to win 67% of their Premier League matches in the bottom of the league.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.960
 Wow.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.360
 And I believe Donald Trump has actually dispatched a fleet to Sunderland.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.800
 If someone starts doing well, should we be concerned?

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.840
 I don't think that's going to happen.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:09.560
 So the weapon that the US would use, if they were going to launch a strike on North Korea's

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:15.520
 nuclear facilities, is this thing called a mop, which is a stance for a massive ordinance

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:23.680
 penetrator, it is a 30,000 pound bomb and it can smash through 200 feet of earth or 60 feet

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.680
 of concrete before it explodes.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.680
 Oh my god.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.680
 60 feet.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.680
 Oh my god.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.680
 60 feet of concrete.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.680
 How's it doing that?

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.680
 Go ahead.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.760
 It's, I mean, is it just big and it's heavy or is it going to drill on the front?

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.080
 It's a bit like, do you know when you're drilling on the ground, then you get a pocket

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.080
 of air and it--

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:48.280
 I don't want to say it, but listeners of a previous episode will notice a similar sounding

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.280
 bit of bullshit from--

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.080
 It's using that same technology then.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:19:00.240
 But in reverse, what it is done actually, it's got a little chisel on the front of it.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.640
 I just want to say, I've had multiple people write in and confirm that story was true

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:08.840
 about the guy being sucked through the earth and this one is also true.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.160
 This one's blown through the earth not sucked, but it's the same general event.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.360
 Does it have an explosive as it hits the earth, which is a sort of first explosive and then

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.560
 as soon as it's lower, then it has a big--

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.200
 I don't know how the technology works.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.200
 That's a really good idea.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.200
 So many explosions.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.200
 Yeah.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.320
 I thought it was more like a drill, like it dives down so hard into the earth, it just penetrates

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.320
 it.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.320
 60 feet of concrete.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.320
 60 feet of concrete.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.320
 A concrete.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.360
 200 feet of earth.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.360
 Yeah.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.160
 So yeah, that's not something that's--

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.960
 That's a hell, it could get through a hell.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.960
 Yeah.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.960
 That's mad.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.560
 Remember that I said that if you cornered a badger on the street that it could--

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.560
 Sorry.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.240
 I don't remember this, then.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.240
 So hang on.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.240
 You're in a street.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.240
 And you cornered a badger.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.240
 Yeah.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.240
 You're in a street corner.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.240
 Yeah.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.240
 I guess it's a street corner.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.240
 You're in a cul-de-sac.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.240
 In a cul-de-sac.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.240
 Yeah.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.240
 The badger doesn't know where to go.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.240
 It's a concrete street.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:08.360
 The claws of a badger are so sharp that it can grind its way through the concrete floor.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.960
 So you also just need a badger on the end of this pond, and that it drills down really

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.960
 hard.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.960
 Or just badger claws.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.520
 So it just slices through the ground.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.280
 There are also plants that can go through concrete, aren't there?

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.080
 You can get weeds and you can get fungi and stuff that can actually grow through concrete.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.520
 So if you work bothered about how long it took--

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.520
 That's true.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:35.240
 A plant on the end of your bum, and then when it lands.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:39.160
 It would have to be a negative geotropic plant because it's digging downwards.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:45.160
 And it has to go with roots that are more than 60 feet long.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:51.640
 This year, this year, a guy called Quang Song Han became the first North Korean to

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:56.080
 ever score in Serie A in Italy, which is the top league in Italy.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:04.920
 So he scored against the goalkeeper who he beat was Joe Hart, the England No. 1 goalkeeper.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.240
 Not the one who was fired for eating a pie.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:13.480
 He's not England's goalkeeper now to use Sutton United's goalkeeper.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.480
 This is all right.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.760
 I'm confusing Sutton United in England.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.960
 There's a fact that I hope makes it into the book, which James found about that goalkeeper

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.560
 who got fired for eating the pie.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.880
 Do you remember it?

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.880
 He got a new job, didn't he?

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.160
 But I can't remember what it was.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:32.000
 His first job after it was that he was a food taster for...

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 Textmext restaurants.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Textmext restaurants.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Yeah.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.240
 Post-being goalie for Sutton.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.720
 Anyway, so it's quite good that England's goalkeeper is the first goalkeeper ever to let

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.680
 in a goal from a North Korean in Serie A.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:50.360
 Maybe they might spare us when they sweep the power in gratitude for that.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:55.840
 They were also speaking of North Korean sport on the nuclear testing site, their main nuclear

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.000
 testing site, which is just outside Pyongyang.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.920
 I think a US satellite, the week before last, spotted a volleyball game being played.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.920
 Really?

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.680
 So that's nice that these guys are having fun and they're off time, yeah, right on the site.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.040
 Are you sure that wasn't by the border wall that you were talking about between South

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040
 and North?

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.040
 There is no wall, though.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.040
 Oh, there is no wall.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.480
 Well, I think if volleyball's going on, there is a fucking wall.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:22.840
 There's a wall on one side and then a two-mile gradual decrease on the other.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.960
 So you hit the ball over the wall and then it just keeps rolling and rolling and you have

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.960
 to lock two miles to collect it.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.960
 Yeah.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:36.040
 I've got a couple of things about just general airline news from around the world.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:43.880
 Singapore Airlines are flying now, not using your classic airfuel, but cooking oil.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.840
 They're flying using cooking oil.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.840
 Yeah.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.840
 They are.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.440
 So this is a thing that they are trying to reduce aviation emissions and they've launched

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.440
 this thing.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:58.080
 It's called the green package and it's powered in part by sustainable biofuel, which is

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.720
 used from cooking oil.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.560
 So if you're ever flying Singapore Airlines, there might be a moment which I never will

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.560
 be able to have on.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:10.160
 Sorry to be a fossil fuel stick in the mud.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:16.800
 I did it, is it extra virgin or are we talking sunflower oil?

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.800
 I don't know.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.800
 No, not sure.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:19.800
 Because you only want the high quality stuff, I think.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.800
 It's true.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.800
 Yeah.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.160
 Do you remember that was that bus in Bristol that was poo-powered?

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.160
 Yes.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.000
 It was going to be running on...

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.720
 Would you rather travel on a poo-powered plane or an extra virgin on a oil-powered plane?

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.160
 Oh, wow.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.160
 Yeah.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.840
 Given the choice, as long as they both work, it doesn't really affect your flight, does

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.840
 it?

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.840
 It might do.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.160
 Do you not think the fumes, if the fumes could seep up through the canteen, but you certainly

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.160
 rather the oil.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.760
 But yeah, I rarely got aeroplanes to think, I can just smell kerosene the whole way.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.360
 No, but you do get the smell of it on the runway, don't you?

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.600
 When you're crossing from the terminal building, sometimes to go into the plane, you can smell

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.600
 a bit of fuel there.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.400
 So if it's a tank of poo, I probably would go with the cooking oil.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.320
 Or as you had delicious cooking oil.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.320
 Yeah.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.320
 Cool.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.800
 I've got another one, which is, I'd love to get this in the book.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.920
 It's my favourite character that I discovered in the last year or so.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.280
 It's the Iraqi Transport Minister.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:18.120
 So plane, aeroplane news from him that happened in the last month is that while flying in a plane,

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:24.080
 as a passenger, with 200 other passengers on board, he went to the cockpit and said, I would

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.560
 like to land the plane.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.760
 And they said, okay, I guess we have to let you, you're the Iraqi Transport Minister,

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.360
 he's quite a powerful guy.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.360
 I think it just does that.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.360
 Was it an Iraqi plane?

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.360
 Okay.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.840
 No, it wasn't, he wasn't like on British Airways covered it.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.360
 Imagine if John Prescott truly knew he would have covered it, tried to land the plane.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:50.680
 I've done a poo, and I'd like it to power this plane.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:56.080
 So apparently they let him take control of the planes to land the plane and they said it

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.080
 was almost fatal.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:03.080
 Unfortunately, the captain managed to get back into the controls in time in order to stop

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.080
 them from dying.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.080
 What, why did he let him?

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.680
 This whole was the Transport Minister, he's an important guy, you don't, yes.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.200
 Yeah, I don't know, maybe he's a massive deal.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.200
 So, okay, this is a quote from the pilots.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.200
 I don't know why.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:19.240
 Then you're on a plane, you don't go, right, he's the most important person here.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.920
 Well, you know, I'm actually the mayor of Swidden.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:28.280
 Okay, you can land it.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.040
 This is a quote from the pilot, posse event.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.840
 The minister did not do a good job.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.080
 He slammed the front of the plane into the ground.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.760
 All the Rocky planes in future will have to have a fake cockpit, basically.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:46.360
 The minister turns up, yeah.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:55.840
 Okay, there's time to move on to fact number three, and that is my fact, which I am pitching

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:03.440
 to get into the book, and that fact is that all NASA astronauts are wearing hand-me-downs.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:09.280
 Now, when a bigger astronaut, when they grow up enough to fit into the suit, they're right.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.680
 Exactly, no, this is a new story that's just come out, and that's a fact that sort of emerge

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.680
 from it.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:19.040
 It's that NASA has suddenly realized that of all the functioning spacesuits that they have

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:24.480
 for the astronauts to do there when they go outside of the International Space Station,

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.880
 they're running out because they only made a batch of them and they haven't made any more.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.400
 So they're really running low on them, and every time a new astronaut goes up, they're basically

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.400
 using a hand-me-down.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:43.040
 They're using a previously used astronaut suit, space suit, and yeah, so they've got, I think,

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.320
 17 more missions, and let's say the backpack alone that's part of the suit.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.560
 They've only got 11 of those that are left that are functional, and they don't think they're

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.360
 going to survive in order to finish all of the missions, and so they've got more missions

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.880
 than they have suits, basically, at this point.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.880
 I think if you don't have the suit, don't go on the mission, I mean...

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.880
 Well, we put it in now.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.680
 It'd be a shame to cancel.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.000
 Last year, NASA had a, what they called, a very tweedy, a poop challenge, which was

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 asking for designs to go to the toilet in your space suit, but it had to be a hands-free

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.280
 in-suit toilet device, right, which could work for up to six days.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:30.280
 The main winner, and I don't know the full details, but it was a small, crotch-based airlock.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.280
 Okay.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.280
 It's a poo-through.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:41.160
 Well, I don't think that's the answer, but you could apparently stick things in through

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.720
 it, which I do not understand either.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.720
 I see what it is.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.560
 So it sort of hangs off your bum, and then you press a button, and it opens it, and you

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.560
 throw into it, and then you press a button.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.560
 Wait, no, it's on the crotch.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.560
 It's on the crotch.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.280
 It's a bit like a burrito working.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:01.200
 It happens is the poo goes in one side like a burrito, and then closes up, and then someone

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.240
 opens the other side, and then takes a burrito out.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.240
 Oh, okay.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.240
 Oh.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.240
 Not eating it.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.040
 You're Mexican restaurant.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.560
 Well, the Sussan United Goldkeeper said it was very nice.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.560
 Oh.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.040
 Anyway, yeah, I'm sorry.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.360
 I don't fully understand the designs of the winner, but there were three winners.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:25.040
 One was that one, the second place was, it's just words here, an air push, urinary girdle.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.040
 I don't know.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.280
 The third place was kind of an external catheter thing.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.280
 Okay.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.280
 Yeah.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:36.480
 Actually, on air locks, non-feesy space, the new space suit that they're designing now, and

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.360
 they're hoping to get out before they have to cancel all these missions, it's going

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:45.400
 to cost $4.4 million, and one of the most important innovations on it is that it has

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:50.120
 got what's called a suit plate interface port, which basically, it means that you don't

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.400
 have to go through an airlock anymore to leave the spaceship, because you just dock into

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.400
 your suit.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.640
 So the suit is docked to the outside of the spaceship, and then you just walk into your

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.640
 suit.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.640
 No.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.940
 And then you don't have to, like, go through, because you usually have to go through an

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.640
 airlock, dock onto the floor, go through an airlock, and then go into the space station

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.640
 where that is.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.240
 It doesn't sound like a good idea.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.240
 Cool.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.360
 That's like, why don't you change into your scuba gear underwater?

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.160
 So if something goes wrong, if anything goes wrong in space, and you're exposed to the vacuum

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.640
 of space, you're dead in seconds, you'd have a couple of minutes.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.640
 Yeah.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.640
 Come on, Dad.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.640
 What?

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.640
 Chill out.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.640
 A couple of minutes to put a suit.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.640
 They're really good.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.640
 They take some about 45 minutes to put those suits on.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.400
 Is the space suit part of the outside of the ship, though?

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.400
 No.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.800
 So I don't think it's like, you put it on, and then there's just a big hole in the ship

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.800
 as you leave.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.800
 No.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.800
 What?

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.800
 Whoops.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.160
 But it doesn't bury a clothes behind the suit.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.160
 I'm not sure.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.760
 So this is what the woman said to design them.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:51.520
 She said it allows astronauts to enter and exit the outfit by docking with the vehicle.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.240
 So I'm not sure exactly how it would work, but I'm sure they've worked out a way of sealing

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.240
 the vehicle behind them.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.240
 Mm.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.240
 I think that's pretty cool.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.240
 You would hope.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.240
 That's not cool.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.240
 Yeah.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:06.200
 I was reading a thing about-- so in the news of the last few weeks, Peggy Witson, who is

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.720
 the commander of the International Space Station, she broke the record for the longest

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.880
 time, and American has been in space.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.360
 She already holds a number of other records for being in space, and she's commanding it

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.480
 for the second time as well.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.440
 And she's an amazing person, and they did a broadcast between the International Space

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.640
 Station and the White House, the Oval Office, so Trump and Ivanka and another astronaut--

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.640
 Why was Ivanka there?

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.640
 She was everywhere.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.640
 Why?

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.640
 She's pretty important.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.120
 She was going to fly the thing.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.120
 Yeah.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:43.480
 So there was a chat that was going on between them, and you could see both at the same time.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.600
 And there was this moment, which they were a bit confused about, and they're not sure if

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.600
 Trump was joking.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.960
 They were talking, but he said, "When are we going to get to Mars?"

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.900
 And Peggy said, "Well, you know, we're doing all these amazing bits of research up here

00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.280
 and down on Earth, and we think by 2030s we could start getting to it."

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.480
 And he said, "No, I think we need to do it in my first term.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:07.920
 It'd be disappointing if it was in my second term, but that's still OK."

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.440
 And so she was like, "Ha-ha-ha."

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.600
 And then people at NASA were like, "Was that like a JFK moment?"

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.600
 Did he mean that?

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.800
 And we have to get to Mars in three years.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:24.560
 So yeah, I don't know, but we've got nothing to worry.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:29.000
 It was a weird broadcast, because at points, I watched most of it, Trump just suddenly gets

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 bored.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 It just looks quite bored talking to astronauts in space.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.980
 And he also looks like he's thinking, "I wonder what studio in Hollywood they're filming

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:37.980
 this in?"

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:42.040
 Like, I imagine he's a moon landing denier, and he just thinks, "Yeah, you're not there,

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.040
 are you?

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.040
 I know.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.040
 I know about you guys."

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.040
 They actually discussed the urine thing, didn't they?

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.040
 He asked about how you eat.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.960
 Wait, which, the Trump urine thing or the astronaut urine thing?

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.960
 He probably actually might have lied in his answer given that, because they discussed the

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:56.960
 astronaut urine thing.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.600
 They avoided the Trump urine thing, actually.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.920
 And about the recycling the urine, so they drink recycled urine when they're up in space.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.080
 And she said to him, "It's really not as bad as it sounds."

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.440
 And he said, "Well, that's good.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.440
 Glad to hear it.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.440
 Better use than me."

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.920
 So one of the problems is that with these suits, the ones that are breaking.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:20.560
 So one of the ones that broke not too long ago started letting the water supply and the

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.600
 astronaut potentially could have drowned inside his own suit.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.800
 They had to get immediately back into the International Space Station and take all the

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.800
 stuff off.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:33.520
 So the big problem is, as soon as something goes wrong inside the suit, taking the astronaut

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.640
 out of the suit in time to save them, it does take a super long time.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.640
 Wow.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.280
 I'm really surprised it takes so long to make them.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:47.160
 You would think, like, okay, we need one before 2024, it can't be beyond the realm of

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.960
 mud to be able to do that.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.960
 That's true.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.160
 If you have a million quid, you would think you'd be able to do it.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.160
 I don't know.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.360
 From Kennedy announcing, we're going to go to the moon to get to the moon.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.360
 It was about nine years.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.480
 We're now saying that it'll take us roughly that long to make a suit.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:04.040
 Well, we're getting a Mars in three years, so it's actually good.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.800
 No one's going to have any suits on.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.400
 Mars mission ends in immediate disaster.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:18.400
 No one could have foreseen as they stepped out.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:25.600
 Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.520
 That is Tzizinski.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:32.040
 Yes, my fact that I would like to get into the news book is that, as of last week, whenever

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:38.200
 state media in Tajikistan mentions the president, they now legally have to refer to him by his

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:43.880
 full title, which is, "The founder of peace and national unity, leader of the nation,

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.960
 president of the Republic of Tajikistan, his excellency, Emma Marley-Raman."

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.960
 And they have to do that every time they mention him.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:57.200
 What can they cough after it and say, "Wanker!"

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:01.520
 So I think this might be the only news book that comes out this year that has a full section

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.520
 on Tajikistan.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.360
 So get it for that.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.360
 Wow.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:11.040
 Apparently, it takes 15 seconds for it to scroll along the screen on the news.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.040
 Which is if you're trying to show a news bulletin, the president's announced, 15 seconds is

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.640
 a long time to have one name scrolling for.

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:22.320
 But apparently you're allowed to say, "Leader of the nation," like if it's really a short

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.840
 bulletin or something, you're allowed to call it.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.840
 It does nice.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.840
 It's nice to be in full, isn't it?

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.360
 Please, just call me "Leader of the nation."

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.160
 Well, they've speculated.

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:34.440
 I think this is something the BBC picked up, and it was reported by Radio Azad-Lic.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.680
 And it was the director of Tajik State Radio, who made the announcement.

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:43.160
 And he just said, "The mandatory use of the full title is required by law and didn't

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.160
 elaborate."

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.480
 So I think, unless I think we're still just speculating going, "I think you're

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:51.080
 probably okay if you say, "Leader of the nation" sometimes, we'll only find out when someone

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.080
 tries it.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.080
 Yep.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:59.760
 So Emma Marley-Ramon, the president of Tajik Stan, has been, say his full name, sorry,

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:07.240
 the founder of the National University, he is a very undemocratic guy.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.000
 As in, in May last year, he made people vote over whether he should be president of the

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 life.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 He won remarkably.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 That's not undemocratic.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 No, you're right.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.440
 He won 94.5% of the vote.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.440
 Well, they like him.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.440
 Yeah.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.440
 They'd better.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.960
 Because there's a lot of human rights repression, a lot of torture and things like this.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.960
 Yeah.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:30.640
 They're 149th out of 180 on the free press listing.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.640
 Wow.

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.640
 So pretty low down.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.640
 Yeah.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.560
 And he's passed a law which gives him immunity from all criminal charges for life, which

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:43.600
 is exactly the sort of thing that you normal, honest guys always tend to dig.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.600
 Yeah.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.600
 It does.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.920
 So he's banned a few things generally that I've just got, obviously he's done that if he's

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.880
 making news outlets call him by that full name.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.440
 One thing he's blocked is YouTube.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:01.880
 YouTube not allowed there anymore, mainly because of a video that went online of him dancing

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:06.920
 drunkenly at a wedding and singing karaoke really badly.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.920
 Yeah.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.520
 So he said, okay, this needs to be banned.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.280
 So he's banned the whole website.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.280
 YouTube.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.280
 Yes.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:20.480
 People would do that if I had the power, there'd be no Facebook, no YouTube.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.480
 Pretty much nothing.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.400
 No, it's not all banning things that he does.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.560
 We should say he has taken a lot of positive steps too.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:32.340
 So policing to Tiki's down, I've been told that they have to go to the theatre once a month,

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.340
 but on different days.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.840
 So there isn't one incredibly large audience on one day.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.400
 I don't know how they coordinate all going on different days.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.000
 If they all go on the same day, there's going to be no police around.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 That's true.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.440
 Mark me in that one theatre, imagine your bad luck if you go to rob that theatre.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:52.940
 I could have literally robbed anyone else in the country.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.940
 But it's meant to be to help their spiritual and moral awareness and there is a photo going

00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.600
 with the news story of these incredibly bored looking men in suits.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.600
 Yeah.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:07.600
 It is just because though the interior minister who's called Ramazon Rahim Zoda just went

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.440
 to the theatre last month and said, oh my god, this is really fun.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.800
 I like this.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.320
 And so said, I think everyone should do it.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.520
 He just went, I thought it was good, thought they should do it too.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.520
 I quite like that.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.400
 Imagine if everything Theresa May didn't enjoy it.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.160
 We all then had to do.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.160
 Would that be good?

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.640
 Oh, we're all going fuck Sunsini.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.560
 Come on guys.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:32.360
 He, another thing that he has put in place as a ban is that so everywhere in Tajikistan

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.360
 there are pictures of him, giant billboard pictures of him.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:41.400
 And he's ordered that in all of the smaller towns and cities, any mayor or anyone in

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:46.240
 the position of power there has to take down the picture if they're in it with him because

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:51.120
 he doesn't want to be associated with giving them the publicity of friendship on, yeah.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:56.080
 So he said, and the way that they did it was, they called up all the local officials on

00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:00.360
 the phone and they said, hi, are you the local official?

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.360
 Yes, I am.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:06.680
 I have a message here from the president and then they played a voice recording of him

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.200
 down the phone line to them where he says, you are no longer allowed to have my photo

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.120
 up if you're in the photo with me.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.560
 And so it's an audio message they played down the phone to each person that they called

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.560
 up.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.560
 It's embarrassing.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:18.560
 That's so weird.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:23.480
 It's a bit like when you split up with your ex, but you kind of like the photo so you kind

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.400
 of get rid of them from the photo, isn't it?

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.400
 Right.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.400
 Yes.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:31.360
 Or when you call up their best friend and you play a recording of yourself down the phone

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.880
 at them saying, I want my stereo back.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:41.280
 I want the canvas with the CD.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.840
 And it's like that, do you remember during the coup in Turkey, President Erdogan appeared

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.200
 on TV, but it wasn't him appearing on TV.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:52.400
 It was someone holding up a phone on the camera while they were mid-skipping him.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.400
 Yeah.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.720
 That's not actually one other thing that we'll probably go in the book is Melanchor, just

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.720
 speaking of people appearing in weird technological ways.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.960
 Melanchor, who was voted out of the French election the first round, but was the very left

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:04.960
 wing candidate.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.800
 It was appearing by holograms, so he was appearing in seven or eight states at once.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.480
 But it wasn't even a hologram found out.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.080
 It was a, what was it called?

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.080
 Hepers Ghost.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.800
 It was called Peppers Ghost, which is a cool or name than hologram.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.000
 So he's like, he's like Tupac.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 Yeah.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 Exactly.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 Tupac did the same thing.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.200
 And it basically means you appear in a similar way, but it's two-dimensional, whereas

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.200
 a hologram is three-dimensional.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.200
 But it's basically a hologram.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.200
 It's not a hologram.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.200
 Yeah, but it looks like one.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.600
 It doesn't understand what I'm saying when I say it's basically that.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:36.080
 Yeah, but you know what I'm saying when I say Montereyl, but it's a hyperloop.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.080
 Yeah.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.160
 I think we're going to turn each other.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.160
 Oh, I just know.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.160
 It's got very tense.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:46.680
 I'm just saying maybe if he used a hologram, he might have got to the second round.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:51.680
 Melanchol did campaign partly via computer game.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.680
 What?

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:53.680
 What?

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.400
 What, like infiltrated Diddy Kong racing again?

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.400
 Like in Minecraft.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.000
 No, his supporters.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.200
 He was quite tech savvy, and it didn't as much good as it could have done, but his supporters

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:11.400
 developed a computer game called Fiscal Combat with a sort of K-lack in Mortal Combat.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.800
 And you played Melanchol in it, and you had to go around finding businessmen and then

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.040
 shaking them up and down.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.040
 Right.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:21.720
 And as you shook them up and down, their coins flew out of their pockets, and you were taking

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.720
 tax from the wealthy.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.200
 It doesn't sound fun to me.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.200
 I've played it.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.200
 It is quite fun.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.520
 Because it's exactly that 2D style.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.520
 It's pretty good.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:34.000
 I mean, James, you're the only person left alive still playing Pokemon Go, so I don't

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.840
 know if you're a good arbiter of what is fun.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:42.440
 Well, I'm going to be trying to get some Pokemon Go facts into this book.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.480
 We were almost late just for the listeners.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:49.520
 We were almost late to the meeting for our book deal, because we thought James was in charge

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.480
 of the Google Maps leading us the way to the building.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.600
 But in fact, we were following a man chasing Dad Pokemon.

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.600
 We got the book.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.840
 The alumni got an onyx.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.160
 Something about elections in Tajikistan, actually, which is quite interesting.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:09.600
 You can run for opposition, but there was no real proper opposition in the last election.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.440
 The closest person who came to being a proper opponent was someone called Oynahol Bob-Zerova,

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.680
 which is a cool name.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:21.040
 So what you have to do to be eligible to run as a candidate for election in Tajikistan

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:27.280
 is you need to get 210,000 signatures to be eligible to run.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.880
 So let's just put this in context to remind you how the British system works.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.200
 In the UK, you need to get 10 signatures to be a candidate for election here, just 10

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.040
 signatures to be your consistency.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:42.440
 In the US, if you want to run for Senate, you need between 1 and 2,000, I think, in most places.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:49.560
 Sorry, between 1,000 and 2,000, or between 1 and 2,000, it'll be over 1,000.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:54.760
 Yeah, and in Tajikistan, which only has a population of 8 million, you need to get one in 40 people

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.800
 in the country just saying that you should be a candidate.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.480
 And she still managed to get 202,000.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.480
 And she was 8,000,000 sure.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.480
 Oh my god.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.480
 That is nuts.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.720
 I think I'd fudge a few.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.720
 Yeah.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.720
 I mean, I'd duplicate a few.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.880
 I think you might get you in trouble with this guy.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.480
 But I'm not going to check the mall.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.960
 He's taking a linear view of it.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.960
 I'm sure.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.960
 Isn't that such a slap on my face, though?

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.400
 She's a super cool woman.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.400
 Look her up.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.400
 She won a wall given by Michelle Obama last year or the year before, like, most influential,

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.400
 good women in the world or something.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.400
 Oh, really?

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.400
 But yeah, hard luck on her.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.400
 Yeah.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:36.000
 Tajikistan has the cheapest pint of beer in the world that you can buy.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 Really?

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 How much is it?

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 30p, per pint.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 That's pretty good.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 Yeah, 30p.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 That's quite good.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.360
 And I think the second cheapest is 36p, which is made by Bhutanese monks.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.280
 So that's the next cheapest one.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.280
 I think so.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.280
 I drunk beer in Bhutan.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.800
 I remember it being quite expensive.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.800
 You got overcharged late.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.800
 You found it all night.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.800
 Sorry.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.800
 They saw you coming.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.880
 I'm pretty sure it was expensive, actually.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.880
 Maybe only one?

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.880
 Six quid for a pint.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.880
 Yeah.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.880
 Sorry.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.880
 We have to bring him for Tajikistan.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:15.880
 Another thing Tajikistan has, which is kind of cool, is the world's most dangerous tunnel.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.880
 Yeah.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.280
 That sounds awesome.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.680
 That sounds kind of cool, I'd say.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.680
 I did say kind of.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.680
 In what way?

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.680
 And who decides that it's the most dangerous?

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:27.960
 I think just the general public.

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.800
 So it's nicknamed death tunnel, I think.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:34.840
 And the reason it was built, it was built in, I think it was started being built in 2007.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:38.560
 And the reason it was built was because before that you couldn't drive from North to South

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.720
 Tajikistan without having to cut through it as Bekastan.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.360
 And as Bekastan, it's not very friendly to Tajikistan a lot.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:48.640
 So actually quite a dangerous trip, if you have to go visit your mum in the north, to go

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.640
 there.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.640
 So they built this tunnel.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.640
 It's five kilometres long.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:57.520
 And it opened up a few years ago, but it had no lighting, so it's pitch dark in there.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.120
 It's got massive potholes, it has falling rocks all over the place.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.960
 And you actually have to sign a form before you go into the tunnel saying that you understand

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:09.760
 the danger of driving through this tunnel, of being hit by falling rocks or something.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.560
 It's got no ventilation at all.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.120
 Oh, I think it's got maybe one fan right in the middle.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:18.800
 And so that means that it's filled with exhaust fumes, so visibility is only a few feet.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:22.200
 And this does mean that if you break down, for instance, in the middle of it, you will

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:26.200
 get carbon monoxide poisoning within a very short amount of time.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.960
 So people who are driving through this tunnel say they get dizzy and nauseous as they do

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:34.120
 it, because it's so blocked up with carbon monoxide.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:40.360
 But it is a great way to get from North to South Tajikistan.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.360
 How long is it, sorry?

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.360
 Five kilometres.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.360
 Five kilometres.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.360
 That is quite a long way.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.360
 It's a long way.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.360
 It's a long way to go.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.360
 It's a long way to go.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.360
 It's a long way to go.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.360
 It's a long way to go.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.360
 It's a long way to go.

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.360
 It's a long way to go.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.360
 It's a long way to go.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.360
 It's a long way to go.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.360
 It's a long way to go.

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.360
 It's a long way to go.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.360
 It's a long way to go.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.360
 I think they are improving it.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.360
 There was a thing last year when they said they like it.

00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.360
 They got extra fun.

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.360
 Yeah, they're improving it.

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.360
 You're not allowed to sign the form.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.360
 Okay, that's it.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:11.840
 That is all of the potential facts that are going to be making it into the book.

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.840
 Again, it comes out in November.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:18.840
 Do go to Amazon right now and click the big button on the front page.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:24.840
 Or go to Amazon and look up the book of the year by no such thing as a fish.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.840
 Or go to qi.com/shop.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.840
 That's right.

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:32.840
 And it's going to contain everything from all the scientific discoveries that happened

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:38.840
 this year through to stuff like to Jekestan presidents, to Trump's wall, Trump generally North Korea.

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.840
 Kim Jong Un.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.840
 We're all on our Twitter accounts.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:41.840
 I'm on @Sriberland.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.840
 James.

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.840
 @X8.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:44.840

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:46.840
 And Shazinski.

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.840

 We've got all of our previous episodes.

 We have all of our tour tickets that are available up there.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.840
 We're going on tour in November.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.840
 We're not only going to record a show, but we're going to be bringing our book with us.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.840
 The book that you can buy, the book of the year.

 Goodbye.

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:17.840
 You can imagine the popular.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:27.840
