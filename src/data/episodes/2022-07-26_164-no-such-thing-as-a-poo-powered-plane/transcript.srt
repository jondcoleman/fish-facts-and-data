00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,240
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,400
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,280
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,200
 Anna Chazinski, and once again we've gathered around the microphone only this time, we've

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,280
 got a big announcement to make right at the top of this show. We are releasing our first

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,400
 ever book. I forgot to mention that to you, actually.

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,960
 One of the last to know everything in this episode.

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,160
 You're not involved.

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,880
 So yeah, No Such Thing as a Fish, we're releasing a book, we've signed a deal, and the book

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,680
 is being released in November. If you're hearing these words, you can pre-order it now.

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,160
 Go to Amazon and click the button, it's a book that click the button, it's a Amazon.com

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,240
 and click the button. It's on the front page.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
 It's on the front page.

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,320
 It's on the middle of the page saying, "By the fish book now."

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,040
 I think what you want to do is go to qi.com/shop, and we're going to have a link there that

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,160
 you click on, which will take you to the page where you can pre-order the book. And it's

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,480
 going to be called the book of the year, and it's going to be about the year that's happening

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,720
 right now, and it's by us, go to Amazon, or go to qi.com/shop, and you'll be able to pre-order

19
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
 it.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,360
 Yeah, and it's going to be packed with all the most interesting stories that we found from

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,520
 2017. This is one that I want to get into the book. Mafia members in Sicily have been banned

22
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,720
 from becoming godfathers. So this is an archbishop who has said that at baptisms, if you are involved

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,240
 in the mafia, you are now not allowed to become a godfather.

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,280
 This is one that I've got, when they voted for the UK general election, there was only 13

25
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,440
 MPs that didn't vote for it, and one of them did it because it was going to interfere with

26
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
 his honeymoon.

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,840
 Okay, this is one that I'd like to get in. This is something that's been revealed in the

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,520
 last couple of weeks, and it's that a Norwegian slow TV show that follows my grating reindeer

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,720
 has had to be suspended after the reindeer stopped moving all together.

30
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,720
 I've got the fact that I'd like to get into the book, which is that Jeremy Corbyn has

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,120
 won seven elections for Parliamentary Beard of the Year.

32
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
 Wow.

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
 Really?

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,480
 Yeah, and it's practically unparalleled in modern history.

35
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,760
 Is he the current reigning champ?

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,040
 He's the current Labour leader. Yeah, it's depending on when you're listening to this.

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,640
 Is that what he spends all his time campaigning for then?

38
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,400
 Yes, he's supposed all the actual beard of the year, quite a long time ago, I think.

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,800
 Yeah, as opposed to the niche Parliamentary beard of the year.

40
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,280
 Yeah, I think that's like qualifying round time.

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,560
 I think I'll make the regionals.

42
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
 Yeah.

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,880
 He made global beard of the year.

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
 Oh, I think it's British beard.

45
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
 It's British beard.

46
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
 A British beard of the year.

47
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
 I can't.

48
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,040
 He is the reigning champion, yes, and he won, I think, with 64% of the vote last year, which

49
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,440
 is slightly more than he won that year's leadership contest with.

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,480
 When is the next championship?

51
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
 It'll be this year.

52
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:11,080
 In time for our book, I think it will be in time for the book, so we'll be able to announce

53
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,000
 whether he's won it a record seven time.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,960
 That's hope so, because if we had a book of news of 2017, we weren't able to get in the

55
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
 results of beard of the year.

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
 It would just be a joke.

57
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,040
 Sorry, I think it'd be Parliamentary beard of the year.

58
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
 Yeah.

59
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,800
 Yeah, so that's it.

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,360
 The book's going to be just packed with all that sort of stuff.

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,080
 And we thought we would spend this episode not telling you our most interesting fact

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,600
 that we've learned over the last seven days, strictly from all of history, but we would

63
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,880
 pick something that we want to go into this book and pitch it to each other.

64
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,440
 So that's what we're going to do, starting with you, Andy.

65
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,720
 My fact that I would like to get into the book is that ideas proposed for the U.S. border

66
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,880
 wall include a trench full of nuclear waste, a one-way mirror, and three million hammocks

67
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
 next to each other.

68
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
 What?

69
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
 Three million hammocks?

70
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
 Yeah.

71
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,600
 It's so much a serious proposal, but-- No, because you could just go under them.

72
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,800
 Or over them, depending on how high up the tree they're tied.

73
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,720
 Ah, so they're going to be trees along this border.

74
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,440
 I think it's not a fixed proposal, yeah.

75
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,960
 I think you could plant the trees.

76
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,840
 You'd have to have something to attack the hammocks, too.

77
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,840
 Yeah.

78
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,160
 It's the idea that you get to a hammock.

79
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
 It looks so comfortable.

80
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,520
 You lie down, happen that, and you never make it across.

81
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,200
 I think that's the idea, yeah.

82
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:30,560
 There is an artist whose name is Jennifer Meridian, whose proposed that one she's proposed

83
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,200
 also a wall of pipe organs and a wall of lighthouses, thousands and thousands of lighthouses.

84
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,400
 So this was a big push, wasn't it, for proposals to be sent in?

85
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
 Yeah.

86
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,440
 So they had a little five-day window where you could submit your proposals, and then they're

87
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,560
 going to pick around 20 finalists in about a month or so, and they're going to build prototypes

88
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,600
 of their sections of the wall.

89
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,840
 How are they going to build a prototype of the nuclear waste one?

90
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
 [LAUGHTER]

91
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,440
 Just a little bit of depleted Uranium.

92
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
 Yeah, exactly.

93
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,440
 Yeah.

94
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
 I don't know.

95
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,040
 The Mero is a very interesting idea.

96
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
 Incredible idea.

97
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,120
 You can see Mexico from the USA, but they can't see you.

98
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
 Yeah.

99
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
 What's the point in that?

100
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,680
 I have no idea.

101
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,760
 You could still see someone approaching if they were going to try and climb the mirror.

102
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,600
 And you don't know if you're approaching for the Mexican side.

103
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,120
 You don't know if anyone is watching that.

104
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
 If you're watching that.

105
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
 What's this?

106
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
 Yeah.

107
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
 Okay.

108
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
 I thought it was just that the Mexicans go to war and go, "Oh no, it's just exactly like

109
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
 here, we might as well say."

110
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
 [LAUGHTER]

111
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
 There are loads of proposals.

112
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,960
 One of them has a monorail going all the way along the top.

113
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
 Oh, yeah.

114
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
 Like a hyperloop, they're calling it, right?

115
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
 Yeah, but it's a monorail.

116
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
 Is it a monorail?

117
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
 Yeah, okay.

118
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
 What's the difference between those two things?

119
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,000
 Oh, one sounds super futuristic, and the other sounds like monorail.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Yeah.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,040
 We've all seen that episode of The Simpsons.

122
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:46,440
 I read the rules for the proposals, the idea of what the wall needs to withstand.

123
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,640
 It's, "Nesawidstand attacks from," here's the quote, "Sledgehammer, Carjack, Pickaxe, Chisel,

124
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,240
 Battery Operated Impact Tools, any kind of handheld tools, and not only does it have

125
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,720
 to sort of deal with the impacts, but it should be able to deal with it for up to four hours."

126
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
 So specifically--

127
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
 Four hours.

128
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
 So it's four hours of a sledgehammer.

129
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,320
 Meanwhile, there's some luck next to you who are the chisel, right?

130
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
 That's it.

131
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,720
 It's like, "Why do you need to specify the chisel when you've also got the car jacker smashing

132
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
 into it?"

133
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
 The four hours.

134
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
 We've made it.

135
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,720
 We've made it car jackproof, but there's a chisel weakness of what we're going to do.

136
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
 It's like the Death Star.

137
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
 There's going to be a chisel one.

138
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
 [LAUGHTER]

139
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
 A little weak spot.

140
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,160
 So it's a very stupid idea, obviously.

141
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
 Yeah.

142
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,760
 And they want it ideally to be 30-foot tall, and so all the proposals had-- so it's a 30-foot

143
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
 tall mirror.

144
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
 It's quite cool.

145
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
 Wow.

146
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,760
 He's become more flexible on the 30-foot thing.

147
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
 Yes.

148
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
 I think he's gone.

149
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
 He said anything over 18 feet, might be okay.

150
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
 18 feet.

151
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
 Yeah.

152
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,920
 One of the problems is that they obviously need to build the wall on their side of the land,

153
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
 on the American side of the land.

154
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,560
 But there's a lot of American landowners who have houses and property that go on the

155
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,280
 other side of these rivers and bits of land, generally.

156
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,360
 So to build the wall, he's actually going to be sealing out a lot of Americans, and they're

157
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,080
 going to be stuck in Mexico unless they sell their land.

158
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,080
 So he's trying to buy the land back from them for the government.

159
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,640
 He knows there's going to be problems.

160
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,240
 So he's planning to effectively go into legal war with a lot of Americans over there.

161
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,240
 So in 2006, they started building a lot of walls at various points, and there were

162
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,680
 442 lawsuits that were reviewed by CNN from the time, and 93 of them are still open.

163
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
 Wow.

164
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,320
 And that was for a much shorter wall.

165
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,760
 Was that because also in 2006, I think George Bush approved a virtual wall.

166
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,160
 I think we've talked about the idea of virtual wall before, but he worked on that.

167
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,920
 The project was shelved in 2011, and it cost a billion dollars.

168
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,720
 Sorry, is that a billion real dollars or a billion virtual dollars?

169
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,120
 It's sadly, I think it's real dollars.

170
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,840
 But the thing about the virtual wall was that it worked by a system of censors that was

171
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,960
 supposed to be able to tell where migrants were crossing the border, but apparently it

172
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,000
 was really ineffective in windy conditions, in mistook trees and plants for people.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,680
 It was constantly thinking that animals crossing the border represent a suspicious

174
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
 activity.

175
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
 Right.

176
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,560
 One person has proposed leaving a four-inch gap at the bottom of the wall, so that little

177
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,080
 animals can cross.

178
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,600
 One problem is that there are 111 species, which cross the area currently proposed for the

179
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,600
 wall, and so lots of them will struggle to mate and breed and live a full, fulfilling

180
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
 life.

181
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,800
 I wonder if all the animals will then evolve to be four-inch as tall, like tidy buffaloes

182
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,480
 going over the range.

183
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
 I've got an idea.

184
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
 What about this?

185
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:43,680
 You kind of make a very slight incline from about two miles out, and it just gets more and

186
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,000
 more incline, incline, incline, incline.

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,240
 And then on the Mexican side, it's a sheer drop.

188
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
 Do you know what I mean?

189
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
 Like a cliff.

190
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,520
 So from the American side, it just looks like a normal bit of like a har-har in an English

191
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
 country garden.

192
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
 Exactly like that.

193
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,040
 Well, that's a bit like the apparent border between North and South Korea, right?

194
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
 Really?

195
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,960
 So about North Korea claims there's a wall dividing it from South Korea, and that the

196
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,880
 US and South Korea built this wall a few decades ago during the Cold War.

197
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,200
 And they say on their side, it's got like little crenellations where guns are, and it's got

198
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,160
 checkpoints along it, and it's this big wall.

199
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,120
 And then it says on the other side, on the South Korea side, it's just covered in turf

200
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
 and grass.

201
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,680
 And so nobody knows that it's there from the other side.

202
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,280
 And the US and South Korea totally deny that they ever built this wall.

203
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,000
 But there's evidence, someone did a documentary, I think, where they claim to be showing pictures.

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,920
 So we've got no idea if North Korea is divided from South Korea by a wall.

205
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,680
 I saw a photo of, because there are doors on the border where the North Koreans and South

206
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,040
 Koreans have police, and they open up to either let people in.

207
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,200
 And when they open up the door, if it's a police officer opening the door on the South Korean

208
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,680
 side, the rule is, is that another South Korean officer has to be holding onto them, because

209
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,960
 they might be pulled through by the North Koreans.

210
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,120
 There's photos you can see online where they're like holding like by the arm, another South

211
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,920
 Korean police officer opening a door.

212
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
 Yeah, it's amazing.

213
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
 That's so funny.

214
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,880
 Do you know the first ever demarcation between America and Mexico when they first decided to

215
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
 do it?

216
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
 They just drew a line.

217
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
 Really?

218
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
 Yeah, drew it.

219
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
 Just drew a line on the floor.

220
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
 What?

221
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
 Really?

222
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
 It's a pretty one.

223
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,480
 You know, like in old sitcoms where you would draw a line around half of the house and

224
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,320
 you'd draw a lot on your side and you'd draw that on the floor.

225
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,840
 What was the marker pen?

226
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,200
 I don't know what it was with.

227
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,680
 I guess it was just a line on the sand.

228
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
 It's probably right.

229
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
 It's a bit sandy.

230
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
 Yeah.

231
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,680
 Well, that's true.

232
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
 Well, you can't paint sand.

233
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
 You can't paint sand.

234
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
 You can't paint sand.

235
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
 Well, you can move the line.

236
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
 You can move the line.

237
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,680
 It's just quite handy.

238
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,480
 Our country looks a bit smaller today.

239
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,440
 And then they just started making fences.

240
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,800
 And the reason they made fences is because they didn't want Mexican animals to go into

241
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,800
 American territory because they had like diseases and stuff like that.

242
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
 Really?

243
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
 Yeah.

244
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
 So it wasn't for people.

245
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,040
 And when they made it for people even, it wasn't stop Mexicans from coming in.

246
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,000
 It was to stop Chinese immigrants from coming in.

247
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Really?

248
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Yeah.

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,200
 So was that like start of the 20th century or something?

250
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,400
 It was during the Depression, I think.

251
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
 So yeah.

252
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
 Right, yeah, OK.

253
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:20,400
 So last week, Congress approved spending for replacing existing fencing.

254
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,600
 Different building, a new wall, there's a strong argument that this is never going to happen.

255
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,200
 So they approved spending to replace existing fencing along 20 miles, which is 1% of the

256
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,800
 border, and to add gates to existing barriers, apparently.

257
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,200
 So it'll be, I think, slightly more porous the border than before because it'll have gates.

258
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,200
 But anyway, Sean Spicer got into a matter of row at the press because he was saying, look

259
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,800
 at this great wall, and everyone said, hang on, that stuff was a fence when you described

260
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
 it in January.

261
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,520
 It's literally exactly the same structure you were calling it a fence.

262
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,000
 And he said, no, it's a wall, it's definitely a wall.

263
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 He got really touchy about it.

264
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 That's clever, though.

265
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,400
 It probably cost a lot less to just have a chat with the OED and bribe them to change the

266
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
 definition of the wall.

267
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,400
 A wall to a line of paint in the sand.

268
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,800
 But if you just do like they did with their north and south career thing and just say there's

269
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,400
 a wall there, when there isn't a wall there, I don't think that's beyond Trump's.

270
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
 You're right.

271
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
 He can do it.

272
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
 He can do it.

273
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
 Yeah.

274
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,600
 All he has to do is say, hey guys, we did it.

275
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
 We made a wall.

276
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,000
 And everyone goes, there's no wall here.

277
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 He's like, yeah, there is.

278
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Yeah.

279
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 What do you want about it?

280
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 You're a wall.

281
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,960
 There was a design that someone came up with in 2009.

282
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,960
 So well before Trump was even thinking about being a candidate, which was a barrier, which

283
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,680
 is lined with burrito carts.

284
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,080
 So it's a proper wall and barrier, but along the ground, like those desks you have to meet

285
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,680
 people in prisons to visit them so you can have a bit of conversation with them.

286
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,680
 Yeah.

287
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,600
 So there's a barrier there, which is permeable, you can see through it and you can pass things

288
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
 through it.

289
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
 Burritos.

290
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
 And you can pass burritos through.

291
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,360
 And he said, who's passing to who?

292
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,840
 I imagine you're selling burritos.

293
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,240
 Probably the burrito seller to the burrito buyer.

294
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
 Yeah.

295
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
 OK.

296
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
 But it can go both ways.

297
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
 Yeah, because money could go the other direction.

298
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
 Exactly.

299
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,880
 Or if you wanted to sell hot dogs in the other direction, you could do that.

300
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
 Yeah.

301
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
 OK.

302
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,480
 It's called Ronald Rail, and he said the burrito wall accommodates for a food cart to be inserted

303
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,200
 into the wall.

304
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,600
 Seating is built into the wall and food, conversation or a buy national game of footsie can occur across

305
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
 the border.

306
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
 Wait a minute.

307
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,080
 So you can play footsie.

308
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,160
 So maybe that's that four-inch gap, you can.

309
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
 Yeah.

310
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,960
 But you know, there is like, there is an existing wall in various parts, of course.

311
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
 Yeah.

312
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,360
 And over there, they sometimes play volleyball.

313
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
 No.

314
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,680
 Historically, they have, yeah. And they'll sometimes have poetry competitions like rap battles.

315
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
 Wow.

316
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,680
 But volleyball, you wouldn't be able to see which way the bull was going until it was on

317
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
 your side of the wall.

318
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,240
 That's why the Americans won a one-way mirror.

319
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,160
 That's the winner of volleyball.

320
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
 Not really.

321
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,960
 It hasn't touched the ground all the way here.

322
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,640
 Okay, it is time to move on to fact number two and that is James.

323
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
 Okay.

324
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:18,840
 I think we might have some North Korean stuff in this book, in this book of 2017, very much

325
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
 in the news.

326
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,080
 And so here's my North Korea fact.

327
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:28,840
 North Korea's national airline, Koreo, owns 10 times more taxis than it owns aeroplanes.

328
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
 Taxis?

329
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
 Yeah.

330
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,080
 They only have 15 aeroplanes.

331
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,280
 And I found that they've recently branched out into taxis.

332
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,200
 And I found that they have about 150 taxis.

333
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,560
 And what we think might have happened is there's a lot of sanctions, obviously, against North

334
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
 Korea.

335
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,160
 So they're not allowed to fly to as many places as they used to be.

336
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,840
 So they need to find other ways to make money and one of the ways they're doing it is branching

337
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:58,040
 out into things like soda and cigarettes and, in this case, taxis.

338
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,520
 And this is quite a famous airline, isn't it?

339
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:06,240
 Because they're famously rated one star, they're the only one star airline in the world.

340
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
 Yeah.

341
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,840
 But not for danger, for quality of service, which is important to emphasize.

342
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,120
 I think there's only been one fatal accident on Air Koreo and that was 1983.

343
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,680
 That was a car crash.

344
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:27,320
 That was at a time when the airline was called KAC, so CWAK, I suspect that's how you pronounce

345
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
 it.

346
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
 But yeah, it's perfectly safe.

347
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,600
 The service is very bad.

348
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:39,640
 Do they have a drag people off planes who've got a perfectly legal ticket?

349
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,400
 But the Inflight Entertainment sounds like fun.

350
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
 Oh yeah.

351
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:50,280
 You get patriotic songs sung by the band Moran Bong.

352
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,240
 And I looked into Moran Bong a bit more, and he actually put them together, Kim Jong-un.

353
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,560
 Did he like the Simon Cowell of North Korea?

354
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
 Yes.

355
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,400
 No, he put them together, and they are 20 members, and they're all young women, and they're

356
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,640
 all quite senior military ranks as well.

357
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,800
 So sometimes they perform in uniform, and sometimes they perform in mini skirts and

358
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
 high heels.

359
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
 Well, multi-talented.

360
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
 Yeah.

361
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,120
 You don't want to get the wrong costume when you're going to wild, are you?

362
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,840
 Although there was that military march in North Korea a couple of years ago, which showed

363
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,760
 the female soldiers marching, and they were all wearing really high heels.

364
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
 Do you remember?

365
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
 Oh yeah, yeah.

366
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
 Yeah.

367
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,640
 You've got to appreciate, because it's quite hard to walk in high heels, isn't it?

368
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,640
 Yeah.

369
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,680
 If you can march in them, then they're good soldiers.

370
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,480
 I think that's quite a good policy.

371
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
 You're right.

372
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,560
 Because if you can do well in high heels, then you're definitely going to do okay in your

373
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
 tragedy.

374
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:50,080
 But they've got songs, sorry, to be obsessed with Moran Bong, but the tracks they say include.

375
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,280
 Let's support our supreme commander with arms.

376
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,760
 We think of the martial day and night, the martialist Kim Jong-un.

377
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,960
 They also play the theme from Rocky, and my way.

378
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
 Oh, really?

379
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,120
 But with the original lyrics, or...

380
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,120
 I don't know.

381
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
 Mmm.

382
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
 So.

383
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,880
 Sorry, I feel like I went on an extended route about Moran Bong, though.

384
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,240
 So is it a solid 20 people, or are they sort of on a rotational...

385
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,240
 No, that's solid.

386
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,520
 And then they disappeared for a while, and then they came back with no explanation.

387
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
 Like, take that.

388
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,840
 Take that.

389
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,560
 So a lot of the news when North Korea has been their missile tests.

390
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
 Yeah.

391
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,760
 And their most advanced missile is the Musu Dan.

392
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,320
 That's the Musu Dan, not the Musu Comet Dan, this is the Musu Dan.

393
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,680
 And they've done eight attempts, and it's failed six times, okay?

394
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:48,240
 So that's a 75% failure, which is a worse failure percentage than Sunderland have had.

395
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,960
 Sunderland have failed to win 67% of their Premier League matches in the bottom of the league.

396
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
 Wow.

397
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,360
 And I believe Donald Trump has actually dispatched a fleet to Sunderland.

398
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,800
 If someone starts doing well, should we be concerned?

399
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,840
 I don't think that's going to happen.

400
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,560
 So the weapon that the US would use, if they were going to launch a strike on North Korea's

401
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,520
 nuclear facilities, is this thing called a mop, which is a stance for a massive ordinance

402
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:23,680
 penetrator, it is a 30,000 pound bomb and it can smash through 200 feet of earth or 60 feet

403
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,680
 of concrete before it explodes.

404
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
 Oh my god.

405
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
 60 feet.

406
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
 Oh my god.

407
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
 60 feet of concrete.

408
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
 How's it doing that?

409
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
 Go ahead.

410
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,760
 It's, I mean, is it just big and it's heavy or is it going to drill on the front?

411
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,080
 It's a bit like, do you know when you're drilling on the ground, then you get a pocket

412
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
 of air and it--

413
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:48,280
 I don't want to say it, but listeners of a previous episode will notice a similar sounding

414
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,280
 bit of bullshit from--

415
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,080
 It's using that same technology then.

416
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,240
 But in reverse, what it is done actually, it's got a little chisel on the front of it.

417
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,640
 I just want to say, I've had multiple people write in and confirm that story was true

418
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,840
 about the guy being sucked through the earth and this one is also true.

419
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,160
 This one's blown through the earth not sucked, but it's the same general event.

420
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,360
 Does it have an explosive as it hits the earth, which is a sort of first explosive and then

421
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,560
 as soon as it's lower, then it has a big--

422
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,200
 I don't know how the technology works.

423
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
 That's a really good idea.

424
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
 So many explosions.

425
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
 Yeah.

426
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,320
 I thought it was more like a drill, like it dives down so hard into the earth, it just penetrates

427
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
 it.

428
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
 60 feet of concrete.

429
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
 60 feet of concrete.

430
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
 A concrete.

431
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,360
 200 feet of earth.

432
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
 Yeah.

433
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,160
 So yeah, that's not something that's--

434
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,960
 That's a hell, it could get through a hell.

435
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
 Yeah.

436
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
 That's mad.

437
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,560
 Remember that I said that if you cornered a badger on the street that it could--

438
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
 Sorry.

439
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,240
 I don't remember this, then.

440
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,240
 So hang on.

441
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,240
 You're in a street.

442
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
 And you cornered a badger.

443
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,240
 Yeah.

444
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
 You're in a street corner.

445
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
 Yeah.

446
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
 I guess it's a street corner.

447
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
 You're in a cul-de-sac.

448
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
 In a cul-de-sac.

449
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
 Yeah.

450
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
 The badger doesn't know where to go.

451
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
 It's a concrete street.

452
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,360
 The claws of a badger are so sharp that it can grind its way through the concrete floor.

453
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,960
 So you also just need a badger on the end of this pond, and that it drills down really

454
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
 hard.

455
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
 Or just badger claws.

456
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,520
 So it just slices through the ground.

457
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,280
 There are also plants that can go through concrete, aren't there?

458
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,080
 You can get weeds and you can get fungi and stuff that can actually grow through concrete.

459
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,520
 So if you work bothered about how long it took--

460
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
 That's true.

461
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,240
 A plant on the end of your bum, and then when it lands.

462
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,160
 It would have to be a negative geotropic plant because it's digging downwards.

463
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
 Oh, yeah.

464
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,160
 And it has to go with roots that are more than 60 feet long.

465
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:51,640
 This year, this year, a guy called Quang Song Han became the first North Korean to

466
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,080
 ever score in Serie A in Italy, which is the top league in Italy.

467
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:04,920
 So he scored against the goalkeeper who he beat was Joe Hart, the England No. 1 goalkeeper.

468
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
 Oh, yeah.

469
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,240
 Not the one who was fired for eating a pie.

470
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,480
 He's not England's goalkeeper now to use Sutton United's goalkeeper.

471
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
 This is all right.

472
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,760
 I'm confusing Sutton United in England.

473
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,960
 There's a fact that I hope makes it into the book, which James found about that goalkeeper

474
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,560
 who got fired for eating the pie.

475
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,880
 Do you remember it?

476
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
 He got a new job, didn't he?

477
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,160
 But I can't remember what it was.

478
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,000
 His first job after it was that he was a food taster for...

479
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Textmext restaurants.

480
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Textmext restaurants.

481
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Yeah.

482
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,240
 Post-being goalie for Sutton.

483
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,720
 Anyway, so it's quite good that England's goalkeeper is the first goalkeeper ever to let

484
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,680
 in a goal from a North Korean in Serie A.

485
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:50,360
 Maybe they might spare us when they sweep the power in gratitude for that.

486
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,840
 They were also speaking of North Korean sport on the nuclear testing site, their main nuclear

487
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,000
 testing site, which is just outside Pyongyang.

488
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,920
 I think a US satellite, the week before last, spotted a volleyball game being played.

489
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
 Really?

490
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,680
 So that's nice that these guys are having fun and they're off time, yeah, right on the site.

491
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,040
 Are you sure that wasn't by the border wall that you were talking about between South

492
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
 and North?

493
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
 There is no wall, though.

494
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
 Oh, there is no wall.

495
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,480
 Well, I think if volleyball's going on, there is a fucking wall.

496
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,840
 There's a wall on one side and then a two-mile gradual decrease on the other.

497
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,960
 So you hit the ball over the wall and then it just keeps rolling and rolling and you have

498
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
 to lock two miles to collect it.

499
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
 Yeah.

500
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:36,040
 I've got a couple of things about just general airline news from around the world.

501
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:43,880
 Singapore Airlines are flying now, not using your classic airfuel, but cooking oil.

502
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,840
 They're flying using cooking oil.

503
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
 Yeah.

504
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,840
 They are.

505
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,440
 So this is a thing that they are trying to reduce aviation emissions and they've launched

506
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
 this thing.

507
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,080
 It's called the green package and it's powered in part by sustainable biofuel, which is

508
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,720
 used from cooking oil.

509
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,560
 So if you're ever flying Singapore Airlines, there might be a moment which I never will

510
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,560
 be able to have on.

511
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,160
 Sorry to be a fossil fuel stick in the mud.

512
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:16,800
 I did it, is it extra virgin or are we talking sunflower oil?

513
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
 I don't know.

514
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
 No, not sure.

515
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
 Because you only want the high quality stuff, I think.

516
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
 It's true.

517
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
 Yeah.

518
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,160
 Do you remember that was that bus in Bristol that was poo-powered?

519
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
 Yes.

520
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,000
 It was going to be running on...

521
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,720
 Would you rather travel on a poo-powered plane or an extra virgin on a oil-powered plane?

522
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,160
 Oh, wow.

523
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
 Yeah.

524
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,840
 Given the choice, as long as they both work, it doesn't really affect your flight, does

525
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
 it?

526
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
 It might do.

527
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,160
 Do you not think the fumes, if the fumes could seep up through the canteen, but you certainly

528
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
 rather the oil.

529
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,760
 But yeah, I rarely got aeroplanes to think, I can just smell kerosene the whole way.

530
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,360
 No, but you do get the smell of it on the runway, don't you?

531
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,600
 When you're crossing from the terminal building, sometimes to go into the plane, you can smell

532
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
 a bit of fuel there.

533
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
 Oh, yeah.

534
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,400
 So if it's a tank of poo, I probably would go with the cooking oil.

535
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,320
 Or as you had delicious cooking oil.

536
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
 Yeah.

537
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
 Cool.

538
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,800
 I've got another one, which is, I'd love to get this in the book.

539
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,920
 It's my favourite character that I discovered in the last year or so.

540
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,280
 It's the Iraqi Transport Minister.

541
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:18,120
 So plane, aeroplane news from him that happened in the last month is that while flying in a plane,

542
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,080
 as a passenger, with 200 other passengers on board, he went to the cockpit and said, I would

543
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,560
 like to land the plane.

544
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,760
 And they said, okay, I guess we have to let you, you're the Iraqi Transport Minister,

545
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,360
 he's quite a powerful guy.

546
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
 I think it just does that.

547
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
 Was it an Iraqi plane?

548
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
 Yeah, yeah.

549
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,360
 Okay.

550
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,840
 No, it wasn't, he wasn't like on British Airways covered it.

551
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,360
 Imagine if John Prescott truly knew he would have covered it, tried to land the plane.

552
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:50,680
 I've done a poo, and I'd like it to power this plane.

553
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:56,080
 So apparently they let him take control of the planes to land the plane and they said it

554
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
 was almost fatal.

555
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,080
 Unfortunately, the captain managed to get back into the controls in time in order to stop

556
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,080
 them from dying.

557
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
 What, why did he let him?

558
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,680
 This whole was the Transport Minister, he's an important guy, you don't, yes.

559
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,200
 Yeah, I don't know, maybe he's a massive deal.

560
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
 So, okay, this is a quote from the pilots.

561
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
 I don't know why.

562
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,240
 Then you're on a plane, you don't go, right, he's the most important person here.

563
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,920
 Well, you know, I'm actually the mayor of Swidden.

564
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,280
 Okay, you can land it.

565
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,040
 This is a quote from the pilot, posse event.

566
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,840
 The minister did not do a good job.

567
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,080
 He slammed the front of the plane into the ground.

568
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,760
 All the Rocky planes in future will have to have a fake cockpit, basically.

569
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,360
 The minister turns up, yeah.

570
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:55,840
 Okay, there's time to move on to fact number three, and that is my fact, which I am pitching

571
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:03,440
 to get into the book, and that fact is that all NASA astronauts are wearing hand-me-downs.

572
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,280
 Now, when a bigger astronaut, when they grow up enough to fit into the suit, they're right.

573
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,680
 Exactly, no, this is a new story that's just come out, and that's a fact that sort of emerge

574
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
 from it.

575
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,040
 It's that NASA has suddenly realized that of all the functioning spacesuits that they have

576
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,480
 for the astronauts to do there when they go outside of the International Space Station,

577
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,880
 they're running out because they only made a batch of them and they haven't made any more.

578
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,400
 So they're really running low on them, and every time a new astronaut goes up, they're basically

579
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
 using a hand-me-down.

580
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:43,040
 They're using a previously used astronaut suit, space suit, and yeah, so they've got, I think,

581
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,320
 17 more missions, and let's say the backpack alone that's part of the suit.

582
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,560
 They've only got 11 of those that are left that are functional, and they don't think they're

583
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,360
 going to survive in order to finish all of the missions, and so they've got more missions

584
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,880
 than they have suits, basically, at this point.

585
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,880
 I think if you don't have the suit, don't go on the mission, I mean...

586
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,880
 Well, we put it in now.

587
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,680
 It'd be a shame to cancel.

588
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,000
 Last year, NASA had a, what they called, a very tweedy, a poop challenge, which was

589
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 asking for designs to go to the toilet in your space suit, but it had to be a hands-free

590
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,280
 in-suit toilet device, right, which could work for up to six days.

591
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:30,280
 The main winner, and I don't know the full details, but it was a small, crotch-based airlock.

592
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,280
 Okay.

593
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
 It's a poo-through.

594
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:41,160
 Well, I don't think that's the answer, but you could apparently stick things in through

595
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,720
 it, which I do not understand either.

596
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
 I see what it is.

597
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,560
 So it sort of hangs off your bum, and then you press a button, and it opens it, and you

598
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
 throw into it, and then you press a button.

599
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
 Wait, no, it's on the crotch.

600
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
 It's on the crotch.

601
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,280
 It's a bit like a burrito working.

602
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,200
 It happens is the poo goes in one side like a burrito, and then closes up, and then someone

603
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,240
 opens the other side, and then takes a burrito out.

604
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
 Oh, okay.

605
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,240
 Oh.

606
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
 Not eating it.

607
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,040
 You're Mexican restaurant.

608
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,560
 Well, the Sussan United Goldkeeper said it was very nice.

609
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
 Oh.

610
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,040
 Anyway, yeah, I'm sorry.

611
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,360
 I don't fully understand the designs of the winner, but there were three winners.

612
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,040
 One was that one, the second place was, it's just words here, an air push, urinary girdle.

613
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
 I don't know.

614
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,280
 The third place was kind of an external catheter thing.

615
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
 Okay.

616
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
 Yeah.

617
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:36,480
 Actually, on air locks, non-feesy space, the new space suit that they're designing now, and

618
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,360
 they're hoping to get out before they have to cancel all these missions, it's going

619
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,400
 to cost $4.4 million, and one of the most important innovations on it is that it has

620
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,120
 got what's called a suit plate interface port, which basically, it means that you don't

621
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,400
 have to go through an airlock anymore to leave the spaceship, because you just dock into

622
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
 your suit.

623
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,640
 So the suit is docked to the outside of the spaceship, and then you just walk into your

624
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
 suit.

625
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,640
 No.

626
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,940
 And then you don't have to, like, go through, because you usually have to go through an

627
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,640
 airlock, dock onto the floor, go through an airlock, and then go into the space station

628
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,640
 where that is.

629
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,240
 It doesn't sound like a good idea.

630
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
 Cool.

631
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,360
 That's like, why don't you change into your scuba gear underwater?

632
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,160
 So if something goes wrong, if anything goes wrong in space, and you're exposed to the vacuum

633
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,640
 of space, you're dead in seconds, you'd have a couple of minutes.

634
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
 Yeah.

635
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
 Come on, Dad.

636
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
 What?

637
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,640
 Chill out.

638
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,640
 A couple of minutes to put a suit.

639
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,640
 They're really good.

640
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
 They take some about 45 minutes to put those suits on.

641
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,400
 Is the space suit part of the outside of the ship, though?

642
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
 No.

643
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,800
 So I don't think it's like, you put it on, and then there's just a big hole in the ship

644
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
 as you leave.

645
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
 No.

646
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
 What?

647
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
 Whoops.

648
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,160
 But it doesn't bury a clothes behind the suit.

649
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
 I'm not sure.

650
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,760
 So this is what the woman said to design them.

651
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,520
 She said it allows astronauts to enter and exit the outfit by docking with the vehicle.

652
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,240
 So I'm not sure exactly how it would work, but I'm sure they've worked out a way of sealing

653
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
 the vehicle behind them.

654
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
 Mm.

655
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
 I think that's pretty cool.

656
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
 You would hope.

657
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
 That's not cool.

658
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,240
 Yeah.

659
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,200
 I was reading a thing about-- so in the news of the last few weeks, Peggy Witson, who is

660
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,720
 the commander of the International Space Station, she broke the record for the longest

661
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,880
 time, and American has been in space.

662
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,360
 She already holds a number of other records for being in space, and she's commanding it

663
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,480
 for the second time as well.

664
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,440
 And she's an amazing person, and they did a broadcast between the International Space

665
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,640
 Station and the White House, the Oval Office, so Trump and Ivanka and another astronaut--

666
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
 Why was Ivanka there?

667
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
 She was everywhere.

668
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
 Why?

669
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,640
 She's pretty important.

670
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,120
 She was going to fly the thing.

671
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
 [LAUGHTER]

672
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
 Yeah.

673
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,480
 So there was a chat that was going on between them, and you could see both at the same time.

674
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,600
 And there was this moment, which they were a bit confused about, and they're not sure if

675
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
 Trump was joking.

676
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,960
 They were talking, but he said, "When are we going to get to Mars?"

677
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,900
 And Peggy said, "Well, you know, we're doing all these amazing bits of research up here

678
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,280
 and down on Earth, and we think by 2030s we could start getting to it."

679
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,480
 And he said, "No, I think we need to do it in my first term.

680
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,920
 It'd be disappointing if it was in my second term, but that's still OK."

681
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,440
 And so she was like, "Ha-ha-ha."

682
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,600
 And then people at NASA were like, "Was that like a JFK moment?"

683
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
 Did he mean that?

684
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,800
 And we have to get to Mars in three years.

685
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
 [LAUGHTER]

686
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,560
 So yeah, I don't know, but we've got nothing to worry.

687
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,000
 It was a weird broadcast, because at points, I watched most of it, Trump just suddenly gets

688
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 bored.

689
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 It just looks quite bored talking to astronauts in space.

690
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,980
 And he also looks like he's thinking, "I wonder what studio in Hollywood they're filming

691
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,980
 this in?"

692
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,040
 Like, I imagine he's a moon landing denier, and he just thinks, "Yeah, you're not there,

693
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
 are you?

694
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
 I know.

695
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
 I know about you guys."

696
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
 They actually discussed the urine thing, didn't they?

697
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
 He asked about how you eat.

698
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,960
 Wait, which, the Trump urine thing or the astronaut urine thing?

699
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
 [LAUGHTER]

700
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,960
 He probably actually might have lied in his answer given that, because they discussed the

701
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,960
 astronaut urine thing.

702
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,600
 They avoided the Trump urine thing, actually.

703
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,920
 And about the recycling the urine, so they drink recycled urine when they're up in space.

704
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,080
 And she said to him, "It's really not as bad as it sounds."

705
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,440
 And he said, "Well, that's good.

706
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,440
 Glad to hear it.

707
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,440
 Better use than me."

708
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,920
 So one of the problems is that with these suits, the ones that are breaking.

709
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:20,560
 So one of the ones that broke not too long ago started letting the water supply and the

710
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,600
 astronaut potentially could have drowned inside his own suit.

711
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,800
 They had to get immediately back into the International Space Station and take all the

712
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
 stuff off.

713
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:33,520
 So the big problem is, as soon as something goes wrong inside the suit, taking the astronaut

714
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,640
 out of the suit in time to save them, it does take a super long time.

715
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
 Wow.

716
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,280
 I'm really surprised it takes so long to make them.

717
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:47,160
 You would think, like, okay, we need one before 2024, it can't be beyond the realm of

718
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,960
 mud to be able to do that.

719
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,960
 That's true.

720
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,160
 If you have a million quid, you would think you'd be able to do it.

721
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
 I don't know.

722
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,360
 From Kennedy announcing, we're going to go to the moon to get to the moon.

723
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
 It was about nine years.

724
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,480
 We're now saying that it'll take us roughly that long to make a suit.

725
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,040
 Well, we're getting a Mars in three years, so it's actually good.

726
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,800
 No one's going to have any suits on.

727
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,400
 Mars mission ends in immediate disaster.

728
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:18,400
 No one could have foreseen as they stepped out.

729
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:25,600
 Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show.

730
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,520
 That is Tzizinski.

731
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:32,040
 Yes, my fact that I would like to get into the news book is that, as of last week, whenever

732
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:38,200
 state media in Tajikistan mentions the president, they now legally have to refer to him by his

733
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,880
 full title, which is, "The founder of peace and national unity, leader of the nation,

734
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,960
 president of the Republic of Tajikistan, his excellency, Emma Marley-Raman."

735
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
 And they have to do that every time they mention him.

736
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,200
 What can they cough after it and say, "Wanker!"

737
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,520
 So I think this might be the only news book that comes out this year that has a full section

738
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,520
 on Tajikistan.

739
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,360
 So get it for that.

740
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
 Wow.

741
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,040
 Apparently, it takes 15 seconds for it to scroll along the screen on the news.

742
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,040
 Which is if you're trying to show a news bulletin, the president's announced, 15 seconds is

743
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,640
 a long time to have one name scrolling for.

744
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:22,320
 But apparently you're allowed to say, "Leader of the nation," like if it's really a short

745
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,840
 bulletin or something, you're allowed to call it.

746
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
 It does nice.

747
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
 It's nice to be in full, isn't it?

748
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,360
 Please, just call me "Leader of the nation."

749
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,160
 Well, they've speculated.

750
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:34,440
 I think this is something the BBC picked up, and it was reported by Radio Azad-Lic.

751
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,680
 And it was the director of Tajik State Radio, who made the announcement.

752
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:43,160
 And he just said, "The mandatory use of the full title is required by law and didn't

753
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
 elaborate."

754
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,480
 So I think, unless I think we're still just speculating going, "I think you're

755
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,080
 probably okay if you say, "Leader of the nation" sometimes, we'll only find out when someone

756
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,080
 tries it.

757
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,080
 Yep.

758
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:59,760
 So Emma Marley-Ramon, the president of Tajik Stan, has been, say his full name, sorry,

759
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:07,240
 the founder of the National University, he is a very undemocratic guy.

760
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,000
 As in, in May last year, he made people vote over whether he should be president of the

761
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 life.

762
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 He won remarkably.

763
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 That's not undemocratic.

764
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 No, you're right.

765
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,440
 He won 94.5% of the vote.

766
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
 Well, they like him.

767
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
 Yeah.

768
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
 They'd better.

769
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,960
 Because there's a lot of human rights repression, a lot of torture and things like this.

770
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
 Yeah.

771
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,640
 They're 149th out of 180 on the free press listing.

772
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
 Wow.

773
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,640
 So pretty low down.

774
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
 Yeah.

775
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,560
 And he's passed a law which gives him immunity from all criminal charges for life, which

776
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:43,600
 is exactly the sort of thing that you normal, honest guys always tend to dig.

777
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
 Yeah.

778
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
 It does.

779
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,920
 So he's banned a few things generally that I've just got, obviously he's done that if he's

780
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,880
 making news outlets call him by that full name.

781
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,440
 One thing he's blocked is YouTube.

782
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,880
 YouTube not allowed there anymore, mainly because of a video that went online of him dancing

783
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,920
 drunkenly at a wedding and singing karaoke really badly.

784
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
 Yeah.

785
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,520
 So he said, okay, this needs to be banned.

786
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,280
 So he's banned the whole website.

787
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
 YouTube.

788
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
 Yes.

789
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:20,480
 People would do that if I had the power, there'd be no Facebook, no YouTube.

790
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
 Pretty much nothing.

791
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,400
 No, it's not all banning things that he does.

792
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,560
 We should say he has taken a lot of positive steps too.

793
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,340
 So policing to Tiki's down, I've been told that they have to go to the theatre once a month,

794
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,340
 but on different days.

795
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,840
 So there isn't one incredibly large audience on one day.

796
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,400
 I don't know how they coordinate all going on different days.

797
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,000
 If they all go on the same day, there's going to be no police around.

798
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 That's true.

799
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,440
 Mark me in that one theatre, imagine your bad luck if you go to rob that theatre.

800
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,940
 I could have literally robbed anyone else in the country.

801
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,940
 But it's meant to be to help their spiritual and moral awareness and there is a photo going

802
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,600
 with the news story of these incredibly bored looking men in suits.

803
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
 Yeah.

804
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,600
 It is just because though the interior minister who's called Ramazon Rahim Zoda just went

805
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,440
 to the theatre last month and said, oh my god, this is really fun.

806
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,800
 I like this.

807
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,320
 And so said, I think everyone should do it.

808
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,520
 He just went, I thought it was good, thought they should do it too.

809
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,520
 I quite like that.

810
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,400
 Imagine if everything Theresa May didn't enjoy it.

811
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,160
 We all then had to do.

812
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
 Would that be good?

813
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,640
 Oh, we're all going fuck Sunsini.

814
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,560
 Come on guys.

815
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,360
 He, another thing that he has put in place as a ban is that so everywhere in Tajikistan

816
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,360
 there are pictures of him, giant billboard pictures of him.

817
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,400
 And he's ordered that in all of the smaller towns and cities, any mayor or anyone in

818
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,240
 the position of power there has to take down the picture if they're in it with him because

819
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,120
 he doesn't want to be associated with giving them the publicity of friendship on, yeah.

820
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,080
 So he said, and the way that they did it was, they called up all the local officials on

821
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,360
 the phone and they said, hi, are you the local official?

822
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
 Yes, I am.

823
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,680
 I have a message here from the president and then they played a voice recording of him

824
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,200
 down the phone line to them where he says, you are no longer allowed to have my photo

825
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,120
 up if you're in the photo with me.

826
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,560
 And so it's an audio message they played down the phone to each person that they called

827
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,560
 up.

828
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
 It's embarrassing.

829
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,560
 That's so weird.

830
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,480
 It's a bit like when you split up with your ex, but you kind of like the photo so you kind

831
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,400
 of get rid of them from the photo, isn't it?

832
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
 Right.

833
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
 Yes.

834
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,360
 Or when you call up their best friend and you play a recording of yourself down the phone

835
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,880
 at them saying, I want my stereo back.

836
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,280
 I want the canvas with the CD.

837
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,840
 And it's like that, do you remember during the coup in Turkey, President Erdogan appeared

838
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,200
 on TV, but it wasn't him appearing on TV.

839
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,400
 It was someone holding up a phone on the camera while they were mid-skipping him.

840
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
 Yeah.

841
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,720
 That's not actually one other thing that we'll probably go in the book is Melanchor, just

842
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,720
 speaking of people appearing in weird technological ways.

843
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,960
 Melanchor, who was voted out of the French election the first round, but was the very left

844
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
 wing candidate.

845
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,800
 It was appearing by holograms, so he was appearing in seven or eight states at once.

846
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,480
 But it wasn't even a hologram found out.

847
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,080
 It was a, what was it called?

848
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
 Hepers Ghost.

849
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,800
 It was called Peppers Ghost, which is a cool or name than hologram.

850
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,000
 So he's like, he's like Tupac.

851
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 Yeah.

852
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 Exactly.

853
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 Tupac did the same thing.

854
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,200
 And it basically means you appear in a similar way, but it's two-dimensional, whereas

855
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
 a hologram is three-dimensional.

856
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
 But it's basically a hologram.

857
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
 It's not a hologram.

858
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
 Yeah, but it looks like one.

859
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,600
 It doesn't understand what I'm saying when I say it's basically that.

860
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,080
 Yeah, but you know what I'm saying when I say Montereyl, but it's a hyperloop.

861
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
 Yeah.

862
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,160
 I think we're going to turn each other.

863
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
 Oh, I just know.

864
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
 It's got very tense.

865
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,680
 I'm just saying maybe if he used a hologram, he might have got to the second round.

866
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,680
 Melanchol did campaign partly via computer game.

867
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,680
 What?

868
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,680
 What?

869
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,400
 What, like infiltrated Diddy Kong racing again?

870
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
 Like in Minecraft.

871
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,000
 No, his supporters.

872
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,200
 He was quite tech savvy, and it didn't as much good as it could have done, but his supporters

873
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:11,400
 developed a computer game called Fiscal Combat with a sort of K-lack in Mortal Combat.

874
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,800
 And you played Melanchol in it, and you had to go around finding businessmen and then

875
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,040
 shaking them up and down.

876
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
 Right.

877
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,720
 And as you shook them up and down, their coins flew out of their pockets, and you were taking

878
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,720
 tax from the wealthy.

879
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,200
 It doesn't sound fun to me.

880
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
 I've played it.

881
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
 It is quite fun.

882
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,520
 Because it's exactly that 2D style.

883
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,520
 It's pretty good.

884
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,000
 I mean, James, you're the only person left alive still playing Pokemon Go, so I don't

885
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,840
 know if you're a good arbiter of what is fun.

886
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:42,440
 Well, I'm going to be trying to get some Pokemon Go facts into this book.

887
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,480
 We were almost late just for the listeners.

888
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,520
 We were almost late to the meeting for our book deal, because we thought James was in charge

889
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,480
 of the Google Maps leading us the way to the building.

890
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,600
 But in fact, we were following a man chasing Dad Pokemon.

891
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
 We got the book.

892
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,840
 The alumni got an onyx.

893
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,160
 Something about elections in Tajikistan, actually, which is quite interesting.

894
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,600
 You can run for opposition, but there was no real proper opposition in the last election.

895
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,440
 The closest person who came to being a proper opponent was someone called Oynahol Bob-Zerova,

896
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,680
 which is a cool name.

897
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,040
 So what you have to do to be eligible to run as a candidate for election in Tajikistan

898
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:27,280
 is you need to get 210,000 signatures to be eligible to run.

899
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,880
 So let's just put this in context to remind you how the British system works.

900
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,200
 In the UK, you need to get 10 signatures to be a candidate for election here, just 10

901
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,040
 signatures to be your consistency.

902
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,440
 In the US, if you want to run for Senate, you need between 1 and 2,000, I think, in most places.

903
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:49,560
 Sorry, between 1,000 and 2,000, or between 1 and 2,000, it'll be over 1,000.

904
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,760
 Yeah, and in Tajikistan, which only has a population of 8 million, you need to get one in 40 people

905
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,800
 in the country just saying that you should be a candidate.

906
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,480
 And she still managed to get 202,000.

907
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
 And she was 8,000,000 sure.

908
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
 Oh my god.

909
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,480
 That is nuts.

910
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,720
 I think I'd fudge a few.

911
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,720
 Yeah.

912
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,720
 I mean, I'd duplicate a few.

913
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,880
 I think you might get you in trouble with this guy.

914
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,480
 But I'm not going to check the mall.

915
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,960
 He's taking a linear view of it.

916
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,960
 I'm sure.

917
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
 Isn't that such a slap on my face, though?

918
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,400
 She's a super cool woman.

919
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
 Look her up.

920
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,400
 She won a wall given by Michelle Obama last year or the year before, like, most influential,

921
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
 good women in the world or something.

922
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
 Oh, really?

923
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,400
 But yeah, hard luck on her.

924
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
 Yeah.

925
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,000
 Tajikistan has the cheapest pint of beer in the world that you can buy.

926
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 Really?

927
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 How much is it?

928
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 30p, per pint.

929
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 That's pretty good.

930
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 Yeah, 30p.

931
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 That's quite good.

932
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,360
 And I think the second cheapest is 36p, which is made by Bhutanese monks.

933
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,280
 So that's the next cheapest one.

934
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,280
 I think so.

935
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,280
 I drunk beer in Bhutan.

936
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,800
 I remember it being quite expensive.

937
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,800
 You got overcharged late.

938
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,800
 You found it all night.

939
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,800
 Sorry.

940
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
 They saw you coming.

941
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,880
 I'm pretty sure it was expensive, actually.

942
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,880
 Maybe only one?

943
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,880
 Six quid for a pint.

944
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,880
 Yeah.

945
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,880
 Sorry.

946
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,880
 We have to bring him for Tajikistan.

947
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:15,880
 Another thing Tajikistan has, which is kind of cool, is the world's most dangerous tunnel.

948
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
 Yeah.

949
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,280
 That sounds awesome.

950
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,680
 That sounds kind of cool, I'd say.

951
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,680
 I did say kind of.

952
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,680
 In what way?

953
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,680
 And who decides that it's the most dangerous?

954
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,960
 I think just the general public.

955
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,800
 So it's nicknamed death tunnel, I think.

956
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,840
 And the reason it was built, it was built in, I think it was started being built in 2007.

957
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,560
 And the reason it was built was because before that you couldn't drive from North to South

958
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,720
 Tajikistan without having to cut through it as Bekastan.

959
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,360
 And as Bekastan, it's not very friendly to Tajikistan a lot.

960
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,640
 So actually quite a dangerous trip, if you have to go visit your mum in the north, to go

961
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,640
 there.

962
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,640
 So they built this tunnel.

963
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,640
 It's five kilometres long.

964
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:57,520
 And it opened up a few years ago, but it had no lighting, so it's pitch dark in there.

965
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,120
 It's got massive potholes, it has falling rocks all over the place.

966
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,960
 And you actually have to sign a form before you go into the tunnel saying that you understand

967
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,760
 the danger of driving through this tunnel, of being hit by falling rocks or something.

968
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,560
 It's got no ventilation at all.

969
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,120
 Oh, I think it's got maybe one fan right in the middle.

970
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:18,800
 And so that means that it's filled with exhaust fumes, so visibility is only a few feet.

971
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,200
 And this does mean that if you break down, for instance, in the middle of it, you will

972
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,200
 get carbon monoxide poisoning within a very short amount of time.

973
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,960
 So people who are driving through this tunnel say they get dizzy and nauseous as they do

974
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,120
 it, because it's so blocked up with carbon monoxide.

975
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:40,360
 But it is a great way to get from North to South Tajikistan.

976
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,360
 How long is it, sorry?

977
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,360
 Five kilometres.

978
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,360
 Five kilometres.

979
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,360
 That is quite a long way.

980
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,360
 It's a long way.

981
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,360
 It's a long way to go.

982
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,360
 It's a long way to go.

983
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,360
 It's a long way to go.

984
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,360
 It's a long way to go.

985
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,360
 It's a long way to go.

986
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,360
 It's a long way to go.

987
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,360
 It's a long way to go.

988
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,360
 It's a long way to go.

989
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,360
 It's a long way to go.

990
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,360
 It's a long way to go.

991
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,360
 It's a long way to go.

992
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,360
 I think they are improving it.

993
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,360
 There was a thing last year when they said they like it.

994
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,360
 They got extra fun.

995
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,360
 Yeah, they're improving it.

996
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,360
 You're not allowed to sign the form.

997
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,360
 Okay, that's it.

998
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:11,840
 That is all of the potential facts that are going to be making it into the book.

999
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,840
 Again, it comes out in November.

1000
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,840
 Do go to Amazon right now and click the big button on the front page.

1001
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:24,840
 Or go to Amazon and look up the book of the year by no such thing as a fish.

1002
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,840
 Or go to qi.com/shop.

1003
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,840
 That's right.

1004
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,840
 And it's going to contain everything from all the scientific discoveries that happened

1005
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:38,840
 this year through to stuff like to Jekestan presidents, to Trump's wall, Trump generally North Korea.

1006
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,840
 Kim Jong Un.

1007
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,840
 We're all on our Twitter accounts.

1008
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,840
 I'm on @Sriberland.

1009
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,840
 James.

1010
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,840
 @X8.

1011
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,840
 Andy.

1012
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,840
