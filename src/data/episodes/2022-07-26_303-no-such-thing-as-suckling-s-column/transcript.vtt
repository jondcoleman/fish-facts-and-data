00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 [band playing]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Chazinski, and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Starting with fact number one, that's my fact.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 My fact is, in 1996, a wind surfer successfully broke into Alcatraz prison while it was hosting the movie premiere of The Rock, a film about people trying to break into Alcatraz.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Wow, that's good.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 So he broke into the prison.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 This is a guy called Jeff Bunch, and he was a wind surfer who was on the outskirts of it, and he wanted to go, so he wore a sort of tuxedo over his wetsuit, and he got to the island.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Over his wetsuit? I know, a bit weird, right? I guess he didn't plan on falling in, so if you don't fall in, you're dry.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 I guess so. That is sensible, actually, yeah. Because actually James Bunch does it the wrong way, doesn't he? Like he has wetsuit over his tuxedo, doesn't he?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 And then he has to go to the changing room. He's wide-a-pound to put it in the locker, take his wetsuit off.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 And it actually doesn't make any sense because the wetsuit doesn't stop you getting wet underneath, so actually when he reveals a tuxedo, James Bunch, it should be drenched.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Yeah, I started to wonder if that scene in the movie had just made it up.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 So this guy did it the right way around. He wanted to get to the premiere.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Yeah, he wanted to get to the premiere, and supposedly he did. He was arrested and taken off premises, but he said he managed to get a cocktail with Sean Connery.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 So I haven't seen the rock.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 What? I know, but I gather it's Michael Bay's best film.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Well, I gather that in a crowded field of other films, Michael Bay has made.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Better than Transformers 3?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 I know, I know, I know, it's a controversial opinion. I've read, I've read a thing saying it says, I think it's supposed to be quite good, isn't it?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 I love it. Yeah, okay.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 It's an awesome movie, and I think it's his favourite movie that he's made.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 All I saw was it, I got 66% on Rotten Tomatoes, which to me is definitely not worth this.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Yeah, but to Michael Bay, that is an absolute triumph.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 It's real Michael Bay slamming today.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 It's awesome.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Okay, so it is about, and it has Sean Connery in it, and it has apparently Navy Seals trying to break into the island in the film, and they use real Navy Seals.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 In the production, didn't they?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Absolutely, so just for anyone who doesn't know the movie, which apparently no one does.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 The idea is that many, many years ago, someone successfully escaped from Alcatraz, and he was put in prison when he was caught on the other side.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 He's been in solitary confinement for years, and suddenly the rock, as he is known, is taken over by a bunch of militaries, people have gone rogue.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 So they need to break back into it, and they get this guy, Sean Connery, out of jail, to help them back in with Nicholas Cage.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 That's the basic premise, so the rock is in it.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 The rock is not in it, the island plays the role of the rock in it.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Alcatraz is known as the rock.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 This party sounds really cool, actually.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 There were 500 guests, and they were told to dress in formally, this is according to an article I read in SF Gate, and Patricia Raquette was there,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 and she was wearing a chocolate brown, 3/4 length satin coat, with matching pants by Dolce and Gabbana, and an aqua silk blouse that matched her iridescent eyeshadow.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 So that was her dressing in formally.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 And Sean Connery was wearing a tan parker, a fisherman sweater, and no toupee.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 No toupee, according to SF Gate.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 That's the dress down Friday.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 You never get asked on the red carpet, and who's toupee are you wearing tonight?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 He was a tiny little funny fact, I found, about the actual making of the rock.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 The script was done, but they brought in some writers to sort of punch up the script, add some jokes, but also to do some rewrites.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 And the two people they brought in, with the guys who wrote "poorage", the British sitcom.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Wow!

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 This is a Michael Bay action, and yeah, the creator of the "Likely Lads" came into the script.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 That's a great bit of trivia.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 So the rock of Alcatraz, this is not the only time that a former criminal from Alcatraz has gone back to it.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 I think that happens fictionally in the film, but it's happened in real life as well.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 So they're pretty sure that Whitey Bulger, he was a gangster, he was involved in lots of murders, not a nice guy.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 He was there for four years when it was operating as a prison.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 And then later on, he went back as a tourist.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 He went there with a girlfriend.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Really?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 And he did a girlfriend just take you back to my old house.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Well, when they were there, they did all the tourist stuff.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 So he dressed up in a striped uniform.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 What is that you do?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Wow.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 And he had a photo taken behind a set of replica bars.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 That is a nice one.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 When was this?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Because he wasn't here in the ages ago.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 I think he was in the late 60s, early 70s.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 And he went back?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 He was close in the 60s, didn't it?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 62.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Ah, okay, my six degree was close.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Okay, but he went back, obviously later, when it was a tourist attraction.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Yeah, I wonder what date you bring up that you were far back Alcatraz.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Yeah, person.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 I think it's on the Tinder profile.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 It's quite right, or else.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Because if you were going out with someone who'd been in Alcatraz,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 that would be a really cool little thing to say about your boyfriend, wouldn't it?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 And you'd want to go there and experience it.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 You think that's a cool thing to say?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 My boyfriend was at Alcatraz, the most secure for the worst of worst criminals?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 It's not actually for the worst of worst criminals.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 That is a bit of a misconception.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Really?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 So that would be the first thing I said about my boyfriend when someone said that.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Although White Ability was involved in 19 murders.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 So I don't know if he's in minimum security.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 Maybe that didn't come up to the third date.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Some of them were just tax avoiders.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Like Al Capone.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 So this is the thing.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 The real mixed ability prison, isn't it?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 The thing with the Alcatraz was really was a prison to cure people who were in other prisons

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 who kept on trying to break out or misbehaving,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 pulling pranks on the prison officers, that kind of thing.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Pulling pranks.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 Yeah, like trying to kill them.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 So that's why it's kind of a amusing idea in a way.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Because basically, that's what it was.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 My boyfriend Whitey, we say murderies.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 More of a prankster, really.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 He was about guilty of 17 pranks.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 So it's basically a prison of people who had experience of escaping from other prisons.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 So in fact, I think the most famous escape probably was of Frank Morris

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 and John and Clarence Anglin.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 And they inspired the film Escape from Alcatraz, the 1979 film.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 And they got out in 1962.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 But they'd all come there because they'd escaped or attempted to escape other prisons.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 And their escape is incredible, isn't it?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 It's unbelievable.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 So I just read the count of Monte Cristo and I thought this is implausible.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Everything he does to get out.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 So they chipped away at their cell walls with spoons for ages.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 And then they would conceal their work with kind of painted cardboard that they'd access somehow.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 They made an improvised drill from a vacuum cleaner.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 Which I mean, how do you do that?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 And somehow they disguise the noise of the vacuum cleaner working as a drill

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 by having one of them play the accordion the whole time.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 They should have played the spoons.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Well, the spoon was busy.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Who's letting them get all this stuff, though?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 I mean, who's letting the accordion in, I think, is the big question.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Well, they had a band there.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Alcapone was part of the band.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 One of the famous prisoners.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Yeah, I think he was on banjo or something like that.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 He was.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 He started the band, I think.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 So this was way, way before this escape, wasn't it, in the 30s when Alcapone was there?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Yeah.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 It was a very long-running band.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 And I guess it's very easy to do a reunion tour,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 because you're all still in Alcapone.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 So more on this escape, we didn't get to the end of it.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Oh, they had papier-mache.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 They made papier-mache heads of themselves.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 And they made it, not, they didn't have actual papier-mache.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 They had to use toilet paper and soap.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 And they made these, they sculpted these heads of themselves.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 And then they covered them in real hair,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 which they got from the prison barber shop.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Brilliant. Yeah. So good.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 They stole over 50 raincoats.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 Again, don't know where they're getting 50 raincoats probably.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 They stole these raincoats and they made them into makeshift life jackets.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 And they vulcanized them properly using steam pipes in the prison.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 They worked this out from some kind of magazine they'd had smuggled in.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 And they also, I think, converted one of them into a life raft.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 And apparently they converted a musical instrument, according to the FBI,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 into a tool to inflate the life raft.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Oh, and you just use the accordion, you squeeze it up and down, don't you?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 That sounds like the one, doesn't it?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 But then they'll hear you blowing up the heat.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 It can't be that.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 In fact, the whole point of musical instruments is they all make a noise when you pass wind through them.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 True.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 I went on the FBI website and they said that they officially closed the case

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 on December 31st, 1979, about this escape.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 But they have turned the responsibility over to the US Marshal Service who continue to investigate.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 So if you at home have any leads or information to share about this escape from 1962,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 then please call Deputy US Marshal Michael Dyke on 415-436-7677.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 Do you cop?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 He thinks they made it.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 He doesn't make it to the mainland, definitely.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 And that they made it away because some people think that the raft, which was made of raincoats,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 and it was also made of cement.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 That was the other ingredient, because they're often raincoats and cement.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 But he thinks they got away.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 And the family of the Anglin brothers, two of the escapees,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 they think that they attended their mother's funeral.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Really?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 Yeah, because their mother died several years later.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 But obviously, the funeral was place was crawling with FBI agents,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 and they think they might have attended dressed as women.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 And all three of them will be pardoned.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 But only if they make it to the age of 100.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 There was a team of Dutch scientists who did some computer simulations

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 about whether the rafts would have made it to the mainland.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 They launched 50 virtual rafts every half hour between 8pm and 4am

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 by looking at all the tides that would have happened at the time,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 and from different locations on the island.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 And they found that if they left it exactly midnight on the night,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 they might have made it.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 They would have been sucked out towards a golden gate bridge,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 but at the moment they were close to the golden gate,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 the tide would have reversed, and that would have sent them to the north side of the bridge,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 and they would have been able to get to the land.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Wow.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 And that's the only specific time.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Every other time they would have got sucked out to sea.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 But this is assuming that they weren't just there controlling the rafts, right?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 Yes, they did actually put into the computer that they might be able to do some steering.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Because they had some oars, they made a couple of oars.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 They did have a couple of oars, but they were both made out of accordion.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 [laughter]

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 On the escaping via the only method through the ocean,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 there was a theory that so Alcatraz was meant to be actually quite a pleasant experience

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 in terms of food, in terms of their showers.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 They had hot showers.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Prisons don't really have that.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Prisons are strong words, we should clarify.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Well, maybe it's not, it wasn't such awful.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Yeah.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 You got your own cell, which actually was, according to a bunch of people who've written about it

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 since having come out saying that that's a really pleasant experience, not to be...

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 I think what I'm saying is it's like pleasant experience, compared to being in prison.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 No, yeah.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 It's not unobjectively pleasant experience.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 It's like saying that the rock is a good movie, compared to the other Michael Bay movies.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Yes, yes, okay.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 No, that's sound.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 But you know why they had hot showers?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Well, this is, yeah, I was about to say, because of the ocean.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 So the theory was that they were so used to hot water

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 that when they got into the ocean, that would immediately give them hypothermia.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Or they wouldn't be used to it as opposed to cold showers, getting them used to a cold swim.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 It is swimmable, so people have swum.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 So I think in, oh, when was it?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 It was, the year before the prison opened actually, a 17-year-old girl swam it in 47 minutes.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Wow.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 And she's not even the youngest person who had done it.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Obviously, you need to be very lucky with the currents and the tides, because it's pretty treacherous.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 But in 2006, a seven-year-old boy swam it.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 No.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Also in 47 minutes.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 What?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 Isn't that crazy?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 Wow.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Do you think that maybe it's like, you know when you go to a water park, and there's that ride where you just sit in a ring

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 and it just takes you around in exactly 47 minutes?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 It seems like there must be just a current that switches on once a day, and that just takes pretty much helps.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Some of the people who are in Alcatraz?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Yeah.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Basil Banghart, he was known as the owl, because he had big eyes.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Ellsworth Raymond Johnson was known as Bumpy, because he had a bump on the back of his head.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 And Joseph Bowers was known as Dutch, because he was born in Austria.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Pigeonably, they just, they heard he was European and just gave that so funny.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 Okay, it is tied for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 My fact is that Horatio Nelson had a brother whose name was Suckling Nelson.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 So, not the most heroic of the Nelson siblings?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 No, it feels like he was given a shot shrift in life, wasn't he?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 Yeah.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 By getting that name.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Definitely.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 He was never going to become the head of a baby.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Well, maybe it means he was the only one who was breastfed.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Do we know if that was the reason?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 That was not the reason.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 Right.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 That was a great theory.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 So this fact actually comes from, friend of the podcast, Carrie Adloid, who sent it to me saying,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 "You're the only person who will find this interesting."

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 That's great. So it's because of the Suckling side of the family.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 So his mother was called Catherine Suckling.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Okay.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 And she had a brother called Morris Suckling.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 And so, Nelson was one of 11 children, eight of whom survived Adloidhood.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 So a lot of siblings, and I think they were running a bit short of names.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 And Suckling was one of the last brothers born.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 And he was not very impressive, I think.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 So there's almost no references to him in biographies of Nelson.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 One of them just describes him as the feckless Suckling.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 He was a struggling Vicka, and Nelson got him a job.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 He was a draper in Beckles, who tried to be a draper, but failed.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 And then he became a Vicka when his father, who was a Vicka retired.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 And he became the Vicka, and then he died a few years later.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 And I don't think he was very close to Horatio Nelson, because Horatio wrote to his wife in 1799,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 "I am not surprised at my brother's death.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Three are dead younger than myself."

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 That was his response to the death of his brother.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 Oh, God.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 He died quite young.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 And actually his father, so their father, wrote to Kitty,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 who was Nelson's sister, about Suckling.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 He will no doubt pass amongst a crowd of undistinguished preachers

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 and gain some respect in the village from his quiet disposition,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 his liking to a little conviviality and his passion for Greyhound racing.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 Wow.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 Got this podcast that turned into a roaster.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Poor guy.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 Dead for ages brought back finally via Carried.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 I know.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 We've been taken down again.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 The name Suckling came from the surname of the family,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 which comes from the word to suck.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 And in ancient times it was a baptismal or patronomic name of endearment.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 So it's like how you have the surname darling.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Okay.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 There's a poet called Sir John Suckling.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Do you know what?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 So I was reading about Sir John Suckling.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 And he's related directly.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 So he was an English poet.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 He wrote ballad upon a wedding.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 He also is credited as having invented the card game "Cribbage".

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Really?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Yeah.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 I studied Sir John Suckling at school.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 Did you?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Yeah, he was one of this group called the Cavalier Poets,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 who are a lot of sort of roistering lads who are all in favor of King Charles.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 I think you've mentioned him before.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 I think so.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 And the poet ballad upon a wedding contains one of the early masturbation joke.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 Look, that's it.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 I don't mind it.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 Yes.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 It's not in the ceremony.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 Do you have the joke?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 I think it's talking about how beautiful the bride is.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 And it's saying that if so hard I had a wife.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 I think it's saying that if the groom had slept with the bride,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 as often as all the sort of invited male friends had imagined themselves doing it,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 it would have spoiled him surely.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 Wow.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 Is that a masturbation joke?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Yeah, because they're all imagining that they're sleeping with her.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 Of course, sorry.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 Yes.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Anyway.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Yeah, but he was probably the most dominant of the Sucklings.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 It's thanks to the Sucklings that Nelson went to see in the first place,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 because it was the Nelson's uncle Morris Suckling,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 who, when Nelson's mother Catherine died,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 Nelson was only, I think, eight or ten years old who was quite used very young.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 And Uncle Morris said, well, I'll take one of the children off your hands.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 And that happened to be Horatio.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 And then Morris got command of a ship.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 And Nelson wrote to him saying, take me to sea.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Please, I want to go to sea.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 I want to go and have a ventures.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 So that's how he got into the Navy.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 He could have been a draper.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 Car.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 A missed opportunity.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 We could have such amazing curtains.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 You could have Suckling's column.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 The thing about his mother, that he remembers.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 So I got his mother died when he was nine.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 So I like you skirted around that with eight and ten.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 Between eight and ten.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 So I think his mother died when he was either eight or nine or ten.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 And he said to you remember, well, he claimed to remember her well.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 But then the only concrete thing he said to you remember about her was that she hated the French.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 It's the whole thing, just an attempt to police his mum.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 It sounds like it might be.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 The whole thing.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 He was not very impressive in adulthood.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 I mean, to crowds who were observing it.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 Horatio Nelson.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Horatio, yeah, yeah.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 So crowds thought he was rubbish.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 He was very short and a German onlooker who had crowd.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 It said, "A more miserable collection of bones and a wizard frame I have never yet come across."

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 Out.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 I know.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Yeah, but he had the crap kicked out of him at war.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 He lost an arm.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 He lost an arm.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Yeah, this isn't a guy who had a hernia.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 There you go.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 You can't see that on the outside, though, can you?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 You can.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 If you put your top off, but I don't think he did not.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Although he was very good at his own PR, so if he had a six pack.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 And he also invented the phrase "The Nelson Touch" to...

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 What does that mean?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 It's about having some kind of brilliant naval strategy.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 It's amazing.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 And people use it, you know, even today in the Navy.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Yeah, yeah, it's a phrase.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 It's not used much outside navies, I think.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 No.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 If we talked about Lady Hamilton.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 No.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 Or Emma Hamilton and stuff.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 So Nelson was married to Fanny and then decided to leave her for Emma Hamilton,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 who was married to William Hamilton at the time.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 And Nelson was sending love letters to Emma Hamilton.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 But William Hamilton knew the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 so was opening all of his mail and reading whatever he was saying and sending it to the government.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 So whenever he was sending letters like to Emma Hamilton saying,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 "I kissed you fervently and we enjoyed the height of love.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 Emma, I pour out my soul to you."

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 Her husband was reading all that stuff, and I guess scanning over it and getting to the important naval stuff.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 So he completely knew about the whole thing.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 But then of course they ended up living in some kind of weird manacia time.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Yeah.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 They lived in the same house, was it?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 Yeah.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 They've seemed pretty open by the end of it.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Everyone was kind of cool with it.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 It was a very modern sort of force.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 And Fanny seemed not to have too much of an issue.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 And...

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 They had a really unhappy marriage with him as well.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Yeah.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 So I think it was probably a relief for both of them when he bugled off with the lady.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 If they kept the family surname, if she could have been called Fanny Suckling.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Oh, that would have been the dream, wouldn't it?

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Actually as well, Emma Hamilton used to call Fanny Tom Titt as a nickname.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 So she could have been Tom Titt Suckling.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Titt Suckling.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Oh God.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 And that was because it was really not very nice.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 So she suffered from rheumatism in her legs and supposedly walked a bit like a bird.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 And so Emma Hamilton being a bit not very nice.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 That's catchy.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 It's a bit Rebecca Vardy, isn't it?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 Yeah.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 I read a really random thing about Fanny Nisbit.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 So before she married Nelson, she was guardian to these three children

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 who were the kids of a plantation owner who was away in the Caribbean with his wife.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 And Tim and his wife returned and Fanny Nisbit's looking after these kids.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 And Fanny brought the three kids in to say, "Hey, his daddy."

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 And T said, "Who are north of these children?"

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 And she Fanny said, "Good God, don't you know them? You know, didn't recognise his own kids. They're your children."

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 And so neither of the couple had recognised their own children.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 And it said that his wife was so surprised that she set her headdress on fire on a nearby candle.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 What?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 That story.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 It's really random.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 It's just so random.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 It's like, you come home.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 You must know you have three children.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 So when three children stabbed in front of you?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 Yeah.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 There's a process of deduction going on there, isn't it?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 He would have thought she hadn't figured it out.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 She was astonished.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Did she set her headdress on fire deliberately as a protest against the looks of these children?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 Or did she stagger back into a candle?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 It's not clear. It's written in letter by her husband and he doesn't specify.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 He just says she set her headdress on fire.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 That's an amazing start.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 It's like an episode of Miranda.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 You know the Hardy.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 Kiss Me Hardy.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 People have mentioned before his dying words. Kiss Me Hardy to one of his officers.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 He later became First Lord of the Admiralty. He did really well in his career.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 It was cool.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 Yeah. But this is amazing.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 The Nelson's and the Hardy's are still in touch as a family.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 Wow.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 Yeah. So there was a dinner party in 1990 and there was a woman they called Mary Arthur.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 She is descended from Nelson.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 And her husband was talking to one of the other guests and said,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 "Oh, this is my wife. She is a descendant of Nelson."

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 And the person they were talking to, Robyn Stena said,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 "That's funny. I'm descended from Hardy."

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 And they got back in touch that way.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 Wow.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 They're not having known each other. They've been in touch since then.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 And they became really good friends.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 And the time's right about it. The time said,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 "Mrs Arthur, who lives in Wobern in Bedfordshire,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 confirmed that the two descendants continue the family's tradition of kissing."

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 Nice.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 It sounds like it's all an excuse for them to have an affair.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 I don't think that is a good rule.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 I think he said,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 "I'm a descendant of Hardy."

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 And she said,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 "Kiss Me Hardy."

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 And then they crossed the table and snogged.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 And the husband can't say anything because they're just reenacting the historic scene.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Yeah.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 I think that's a really bad story.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 And that is James.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that in the 11th century,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 hundreds of people in the UK paid their rent in eels.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Okay, so this is a website run by a guy called John Wyatt Greenley.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 He's a historian whose work, according to his site,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 examines the cultural history of eels in England

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 from the 10th through the 17th centuries,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 focusing on eels' role in economic change,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 the growth of a national English identity

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 and the evolution of spatial practice in early modern London.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 And that was a quote that was a lot longer than I thought it was going to be this afternoon.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 But he has a bit where he looks at rents that were paid in eels.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 And this was a thing that happened probably before the 10th century,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 but that's where we have the records from.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 For instance, a Doomsday book records payments

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 like the village of Hamston, who owed Earl Hugh 75,000 eels per year for their rent.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 So much.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 Dead or alive?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 I think dead.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 Okay.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 It's harder to collect.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 I suppose live eels.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Yes, it is easier to collect.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 No, it is an Andy. Come on.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 I'll tell you why.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 If there are 10 dead eels on the floor and 10 live eels in a bucket,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 let's see you can pick them up quickest.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 Okay, it's easier to collect dead eels, but it's harder to find them, I think.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 How does it find dead eels?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 It's harder to find dead eels lying around.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 Yeah, the natural state is alive.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Yeah.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 I do get that.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Presumably the eel farmers, right?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 It's not people going around looking for dead eels.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 No, no, no. You can't farm an eel.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 You can't farm an eel.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 You can't farm an eel.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 No.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 This was basically people catching them and then selling them at market

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 and then picking them up and using the most kind of currency.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Oh, wow.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 Because they come on sticks. So you get 25 eels on a stick.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 So when you had to give 75,000 eels, it would be what, 3000 sticks.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 What?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 It was sort of like the equivalent of candy floss or something.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 You'd take a stick of eels.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 Yeah.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 And lick away at it.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 I'm well, I'm not sure about the licking part.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Well, they were ranked collectors so keen on eel.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 Well, was it just a huge surplus of eels?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 It's popular food.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 Yeah?

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 It is popular food.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 So John White Greenley says that the reason that he looks into this is

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 actually if you look in the Doomsday book, those payments in pigs,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 in fish, in ale, you might pay in different foods and drinks.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 Because if you don't have cash, you know, it's a thing that everyone has.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 But people these days are really particularly interested in eels

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 because we don't really eat eels anymore.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 So when you look at a list and it says 75,000 eels,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 you go bloody hell.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 When you get 75,000 eels from, you can't farm an eel.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Well, I had an eel for breakfast at the weekend.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 Did you really?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 Yeah, smoked eel.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 So we don't eat eels anymore?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 No, no, I had no eels.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 I had complex, but what I'm saying is less common.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 I didn't have, yeah, 75,000 eels.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 But there used to be, maybe it was just there was a lot more.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 So I think 50% of the biomass of European freshwater

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 or some parts of it was made of eels.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 You're kidding.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 In the olden days.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 Wow.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 That's the olden days.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 I don't have an exact year.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 But around this time.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Back in the days before the fends were drained.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 It was very rich eel territory.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 You know, you'd go boating around the waters.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 And this guy, John Wyatt Greenley, he's brilliant.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 Yeah.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 His Twitter name is surprised eel historian.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 Yeah.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 And then the biography for him says surprised historian.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 Not surprised eels.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 He's a medievalist at Cornell University.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 And he's done a map.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 He's done an interactive map of the UK.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 And you can look on it.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 And you can click to see where your nearest local eel rent was.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 And I looked and it's about four miles from where I grew up.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 Kingston.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 There was a rent of 125 eels.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 Wow.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 Yeah.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 It's really interesting.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 My closest was Manchester.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 Nice.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 Oh, I didn't.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 I just was busy looking at his replies to that tweet.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 Because it was so successful.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 He was like, oh my god.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Who would have thought eels?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 This is fantastic.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 So he was a surprised eel historian.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 He's done a kind of calculation of what eels would get you today

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 and today's money.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 So he said that he worked out because he's at Cornell University,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 that if you had to pay to go to Cornell University,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 you would need between 106,612 and 213,024 eels,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 either of which represents a number of eels

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 that the Cornell Burses office is ill-prepared to hand.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 I mean, you'd say that an Amazon Prime membership,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 which is $99 a year,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 would cost only 150 to 300 eels.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 That's about six to 12 sticks of eels.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 I really didn't know that you cannot eat eel raw.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 So again, in sushi is kind of--

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Did you just find that this weekend?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 I've had a very bad few days.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 You got it in sushi, don't you?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 You do, and it's always cooked.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 So because if you eat it raw, it's got toxic blood.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 And it causes your muscles to spasm, including your heart.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 And it's got enough toxin that it can kill a human being.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 If you suck all the blood out of an eel, you'll die.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 Yeah.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 Wow.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 You deserve to as well.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 But so that, if we're saying eels not eaten that much here

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 these days, in Japan, it's obviously massive.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 They have an annual consumption rate of 100,000 tons of eels.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 So that's 70% of the worldwide eel catch that we get.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 But they've declined in their eel populations so massively.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 So I'm like genuinely 99%, like that's how high it is.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 So they now have to import eel, glass eel,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 and so on from America in order to eat.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 But also as a result, because they're manufacturing great sushi out there.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 They get sent back to America.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 The Americans are sending their eels over to then have it sent back to eat.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 So it's taken two plane rides by the time they've eaten.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 That's kind of nice in a way, because eels in their migration

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 are used to migrating thousands of kilometers.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 They have this extraordinary migration.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 So it's maybe it's sort of nice that, post-humusly,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 they're still migrating thousands of miles back and forth.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Do you think that's a little bit of consolation for the--

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 No, I don't think so.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 No, I think so.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 I mean, the population of Client is amazing.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 So there are temporary bands that have been put in place in the UK.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 And it's lots to do with dredging of the ocean as well.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 This really just decimates the population.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 But they hatch in the Sargasso Sea, which is West Indies way, Bermuda.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 It's like North-- and it's not to see it.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 It's a portion of the North Atlantic, isn't it?

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 So it's a portion of the ocean.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 But then they drift over on the Gulf Stream when they're really tiny.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 And then they borrow into river mouths and estuaries and things in the UK and across Europe.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 And then they stay there for up to 12 years.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 Some of them can live in a pool for up to 30 or 40 years, just living there and getting bigger.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 And then they suddenly, they feel the call.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 They swim back to the Sargasso Sea. They spawn, they die.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Yeah.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 We think.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 We think.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 No one's ever seen it happen.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 No one's ever seen an eel spawn.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 It's crazy.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 It's insane.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 So in the olden days, people like Pliny and all those other types,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 until the 1700s kind of thought they came from nowhere.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 And I kind of still think they do.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 Because no one's seen this one.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 We found young eels, very young eels born in the Sargasso Sea, haven't we?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 And then we've got the old eels that look totally different, by the way, in Europe and America.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 But that's it.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 And they're constantly changing colors.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 So when they spawn, they look like these tiny glass leaves.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 And then they become transparent glass eels.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 And then they turn into like noodle-looking things.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 They go brown.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Then they go yellow.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 Then they go silver.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 It's this weird kind of disco effect.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 And silver is the one where you know that they're going to start heading back to the Sargasso Sea to die.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 What do they feel the cool?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 We don't know that either.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 We don't know.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 And we do know that if you farm an eel, which you can't do these days, they have an eel farm.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 They have an eel farm.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 It is.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 But if you like have an eel farm and you raise them there, so they were born there,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 they still have the instinct to return to the Sargasso Sea, which is kind of embedded in them somehow.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 So do they just jamming their heads into the edge of the pond in the direction of the Sargasso Sea?

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 I fear they might do that kind of thing.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 Wow.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 They're really clever in the way they migrate as well.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 So now we have fight scientists, not have actually tagged them.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 But it's not like they haven't managed to tag them all the way into the migration.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 I just...

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 Come on, they're just not looking close enough for this spawn, are they?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 I know.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 I reckon if we go to the Sargasso Sea.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Yeah.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 Well, I think you can see the spawn.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 You've just never seen the eel spawn it, right?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 There was one day in a scientist who spent 15 years of his career looking in the mid-Atlantic

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 for seven millimeter long, um, larvae.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 I mean, he never did.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 Yeah, but that...

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 I mean, it does feel like he's not done a very good job.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 You surely look for the bigger ones on their way back to the Sargasso Sea.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 You would look at the spawn and then you keep looking at it at earlier and earlier times

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 and then look at the bigger ones later at later times and eventually the two things must come together.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Guys, it must be harder than it looks.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Otherwise, I'm sure these people would have succeeded anyway.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 So I was just saying that we have tagged them now.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 So they've tagged them for about the first 1500 kilometers of their journey.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 And what they found out is if you tag a European eel when it's going back to spawn,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 it doesn't make a b-line for the Sargasso Sea.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 It doesn't do the shortest route.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 It heads a bit further south, so it heads towards where the Azores would be.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 And that's because they're smart enough to know that there are ocean currents

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 that they then pick up like a conveyor belt.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 And that'll get them then much faster.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 And that's any way they get their own tunnel.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 Boy off Alcatraz.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 Exactly.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 Wow.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 That is amazing.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 And they can just sit in it, not do anything.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 So we've been looking as to how they spawn for centuries, right?

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 But it was only in the early 1900s that that was found.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 And it was this guy that you're talking about.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 It was a Danish biologist, Johann Schmidt.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 And he was the one who pinpointed the Sargasso was the spot that they were doing it.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 And he, I was just looking into him, he was married to a lady called Cool.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 And he studied under a man called Warming.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 Very nice.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 Nice of that, yeah.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 And so Cool was the daughter of the old Karlsburg brewery in Copenhagen,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 the chief director there.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 And actually the whole thing, the reason we know about this morning,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 is Karlsburg itself sponsored him to go and look for it.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 So it's thanks to Karlsburg beer that we know about this.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 Wow.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 And was he the 15 years guy?

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Yeah, that was probably not the best scientific study in the world.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 And then this other guy, Warming, is a Danish botanist who is a founder of the scientific discipline of ecology.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 He's the relationship of man and earth is called Warming, which is quite nice.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 Nice.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 That's a really good scientific fact, sir.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 Thank you.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 There is one reported case of a male dolphin masturbating by wrapping an electric eel around its penis.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 What? How do we know it was masturbating?

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 He was thinking about John Suckling's wife at the time.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 I mean, did it ejaculate at the end?

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 I don't know.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 I haven't seen the video.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 This is two personal questions.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 I'm sorry, but if the dolphin is going to tell us it's been masturbated with an eel, then we want the details.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 I don't know.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 You're quite right.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 The eel might have been trying to asphyxiate the penis.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 Indeed.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 Or have sex with it thinking it's another eel.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Mm-hmm.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 I don't know what happened.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 Speaking of members with eels wrapped around them.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 Good link.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 There is an old tradition in the fends of England of using a wedding ring made of eel skin.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 Oh.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 So that's another way you can wrap a bit of eel around yourself to symbolise a love match.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 Yeah.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 That sounds very flimsy.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Yeah, I don't know if it's the ring for life, but it's maybe the ring you use for wedding ceremony.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 All of a sudden, you feel like it's your first husband kind of thing.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Chuzinski.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 My fact is that according to Polynesian mythology, Maui, who is the god in the Disney film Moana,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 died by climbing into a goddess's vagina and being crushed to death by the obsidian teeth in there.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 And they didn't show that in the film.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Yeah.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Yeah, we went to Disney and watched that film.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Do you remember because we were sponsored by Moana?

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 Yeah, that's right.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 You guys were quite late getting in because you needed to remember you had to sign in or something like that.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 Yeah.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 And so you missed a start of it, but I went in without signing in.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 And they showed that scene.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 Oh, you get out of the top.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Oh, God.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 So show the death scene at the top, okay.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 And then the rest is a flashback.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 Of course.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 So if you did miss that first scene of the film, all the film.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 You should know that this is the film Moana and Moana's sort of demigod sidekick in the film is Maui,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 who was a real god, very important god in, or demigod in Pacific mythology.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 And he exists all over the Pacific Islands.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 So like Hawaii, he's very important.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 But Tahiti's Samoa, the Maui people, they all have slightly different versions of him.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 But there is a version where he's a real trickster character.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 He's a prankster.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 He's a prankster.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 He's like Whitey Bulger or Al Capone.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 Yeah.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 He's a prankster.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 How much murderer?

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 Does he murder anyone?

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 He doesn't actually.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 He's just a little prankster.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 And one of the ways he dies is when he's trying to become immortal.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 And the way he decides to do this is to enter the goddess of death,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 who's called Hine Nui Teppo, to get in through her vagina,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 pluck out her heart on the way up to her mouth, and emerge from her mouth.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 And apparently this will reverse the birth process and make him immortal.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 I don't know if that's scientifically accurate.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 But anyway, he does this.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 And he's got his bird friends with him.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 So some birds who are his mates.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 And he says, please don't laugh while I do this because it's your wake up.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 And they couldn't hold it in because it's quite funny watching someone climb through a vagina.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 And so she woke up.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 And she tensed up.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 And the little teeth in her vagina, which we all have,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 crushed him to death.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Wow.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 She's quite a starry.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 She's really, she's described us.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 Did you say that she's the goddess of death?

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 Yes.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 Oh, wait, or a mortality.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 I think death and mortality, yeah.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 Okay.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 She's got very vivid description in the mist.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 She's got eyes of green stone, hair of kelp,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 and the mouth of a baracuda.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 Mm.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 Of as well as, of course, having a toothy fanny.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 She has a vagina, a bit like a moray eel.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 They've got really big teeth, haven't they?

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 Oh, they do.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 They've got like a pharyngeal jaw, like alien.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 And they've got backwards teeth, so that if you accidentally

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 swim in the mouth, you can't swim out again.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 Oh, gosh.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 Grammar, what big teeth you have.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 And then what a surprising location.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 So Maui, I don't think you're mowing.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 Well, actually, we said that he didn't, his pranks didn't kill anyone.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 And I think that is true, perhaps.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 I don't know of any that did.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 But he did once go fishing with a guy called Arawaru,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 who was a husband of his sister.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 He was so annoyed with Arawaru that he turned him into a dog.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 Oh.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 And that was the first ever dog.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 And that's where dogs come from.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 Because Maui, actually, if you know the song from Joanna,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 you're welcome, which is his big song.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 It's all about the things which he did.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 So he created the moon and the sun and the wind and all these different things.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 He pulled the islands up from the ocean floor, didn't he?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 He had a magic jawbone, which, according to some of the myths,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 is the jawbone of his grandmother.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 He's also quite big, so she must have been huge.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 And he did things with useful things with it.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 So he used it as a fish hook to pull up islands from the ocean floor.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 And actually, the names of North Island and South Island in New Zealand now

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 are Teika, our Maui, and Tewaka, our Maui, which means fish of Maui and canoe of Maui.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 Oh.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 Because that's from when he caught a fish and turned it into an island.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 And he turned his canoe into another island.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 That's what was turning stuff into islands.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 That's great.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 That was the sky. That was the thing he did.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 The sky was pressed down close to the earth.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 So the height of a tall tree, it was pressed right down to there.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 So it was obviously very restrictive for everybody.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 And he just lifted it up and ran to a very high peak and chucked it up in the air.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 That would be so annoying if the sky was that low, wouldn't it?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Yeah.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 So it wouldn't hit your head on it.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 But you would be able to fly a drone.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 You wouldn't be able to fly a drone.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 Nightmare.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 Nightmare.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 So another character in Moana is Tafisi, who's got a goddess who comes up at the end.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 She's actually based on Pele, who is a genuine goddess in Hawaiian mythology.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 And so she's like the most important goddess, goddess of volcanoes, and stuff like that.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 It's like the big volcano in Hawaii is called Mount Pele, or Pele, I think.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 Yes.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 And that's kind of her embodiment, is that right?

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 Yeah.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 You're meant to pay tribute to it when you go there.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 I went there and I did it.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 Did you not?

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 No.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 I wonder you got this cold for so long.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 You're meant to give, I think it's brandy, I think it is.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 You go, you go and you go and pour gin for Pele.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 She loves gin.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 Yeah.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 There was a hog god, called Kamapua-a, which I'm sure I'm pronouncing wrong.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 But he married Pele, the fire goddess.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 And his habits were so bad because he was a hog that she couldn't cope.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 They had huge arguments and eventually she won all the arguments and he was forced to surrender

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 and turned himself into a fish.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 Oh.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 And that is a Hawaiian fish.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 And it's the Hawaiian fish with the best name.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 I think we might have talked about it before.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 Oh, the really long name.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 Yeah, I can't, I'm going to have a crack in it.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 It's called the Huma-Huma-Nuku-Nuku-Apua-a.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 And it makes this grunting noise, which apparently sounds a bit like a hog.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 Which is because it used to be a hog when he was a hog.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 That was always a relationship that was going to fail between a volcano and a hog, wasn't it?

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 It's a one way trip to a barbecue, basically.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 Can we talk about having teeth in vaginas?

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 Oh, sure.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 Yeah.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 Because this is an extremely common myth around the world, around the whole world.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 In fact, there are 22 variants of this is called vagina-dentata myth in North American cultures alone.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 The Wichita one has a toothed vagina wandering at the round at night, castrating men in their sleep.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 The mandiruku myth has a woman with a vagina like a crocodile's mouth.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 In Irissa, in India, the myth has the toothed vagina, not only castrating men, but also eating the rice crop causing famine.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 Oh, really?

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 And it's basically a misogynistic way of saying that women are evil and you should stay away from them.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 Right.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 Wow.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 I don't know.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 I thought it was like an empowering woman.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 You know, we get to chop off men's penises without vaginas if we want to.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 Yeah.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 I immediately bought it to the misogynist.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 I was like greedy vagina.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 Yeah.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 I'm afraid.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 In most of the time, it is quite misogynistic.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 Very occasionally, you get one where the woman is empowered in the story.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 So in the chukchi myths, which is in northern Siberia, you have a woman who is married to an old man

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 and to avoid having sex with him.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 She puts a fish head in her vagina so the teeth will cut him every time he tries to have sex.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 Right.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 And she takes the piss out of him, doesn't she?

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 He has sex with her the first time.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 He's like, "Oh my gosh, there are teeth in there."

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 And then she's like, "I can't believe we didn't know all vaginas have teeth."

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 How embarrassing.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 But it's just a fish head that she's put in there.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 Just a fish head.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 And she must take it out.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 I seem she doesn't leave it there.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 Once she's got away with it once.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 She doesn't have to.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 She doesn't have to.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 Have it for her whole life.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 Just the thing on Moana, the movie itself.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 So if that scene, the vagina crushing scene was in the movie, obviously it would have been an ex-rated movie.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 Right.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 But in Italy, they actually had to change the name of Moana altogether because in Italy,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 there was a very famous porn star called Moana, Moana Posi.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 And parents were worried and they were worried in the studio that people googling Moana

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 to see cinema times and so would come across Moana Posi instead of the actual cinema.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 So it was renamed to be Oceana.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 So in Italy, it was released as Oceana to stop the ex-rated references coming out.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 But she's, of course, to be a very disgusting club in Kingston, Oceana.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 Which is why it couldn't be called Oceana in the UK.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 Exactly.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 They had to change it back.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 They did really good research on Moana into Pacific Islanders culture and history and stuff,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 didn't they?

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 And they consulted lots of experts.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 So I think they're creators of the film travelled to Polynesia multiple times and they put together

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 a committee of linguists and anthropologists and historians from all over the Pacific Islands,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 who I think ended up being called the something committee, the Pacific Committee or something.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 Oh no, they were called the oceanic trust.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 And they did things like, for instance, Maui for the first year of when they were coming up with the film was bald.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 So if you remember the film, he's got all this curly, big curly head of hair.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 Yeah.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 And that's because he was bald and they went to the Pacific Island anthropologist who said

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 that's incredibly offensive because the hair is where your mana is, is where your power is.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 And he's very powerful.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 You've got to give him more hair.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 So they gave him more and more hair until they don't just stop.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 So he was meant to be quite a skinny character as well.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 Maui in the mythology is a skinny character, but they made him quite large.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 But do we know why that was?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 Why would they go against that?

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 So that was controversial, but that was actually at the advice of the oceanic trust committee.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 So he's a very strong character and people said this is playing into stereotypes of obesity.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 But the committee said, look, he's just incredibly powerful, imposing figure.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 And also it's much funnier if you've got this huge thing.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 And he's not fat in the film.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 And I would say he is big-boned and strong.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 Mighty.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 Mighty.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 Exactly.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 Mighty Maui.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 Do you know what are the main imports of the Pacific Islands?

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 This is now a general Polynesia effect.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 Imports.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 Yeah.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 Spam.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 Oh, it's so close.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 Oh, I think.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 I thought it was, yeah.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 Yeah, all right.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 Well, maybe another one.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 Oh, damn.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 Okay.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 Okay, but another food stuff.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 So it's a food stuff that Americans, not Eels, is a food stuff that Americans, under USA, eat a lot of.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 And it's a bit of it that Americans never eat.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 Hmm.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 But it gets messy.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 Oh, is it the toy in a happy meal?

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 It's the toy in a happy meal.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Wow.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 There's a huge part.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 And it's controversial because they've got a lot of plastic in them.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 You know, they'll get eaten a lot in the Pacific.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 No.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 Oh, it's not.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 No, that's a great guest.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 Sorry.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 I didn't really connect the other day and I didn't get anything right.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 And I know you guys kicked ass on it.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 So I thought James had just pulled out another stunner there.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 So it's turkey tails.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 So I didn't know about this.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 But in America, each year, there are 250 million turkeys eaten.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 And turkeys all have this tail, which is this weird oily gland at the very base.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 And it's basically the gland that keeps the feathers in of the tail.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 And it's got this fatty chunk of meat at it and it's never used.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 And America, it also gets called the Parsons nose.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 It's a great name for it.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 But it's not sent to shops.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 It just never gets eaten in the USA.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 So they all get sent to the Pacific Islands.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 And they started basically, America started basically dumping these there.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 And now it's a massive part of the diet.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 In 2007, the average Samoan was eating 44 pounds of turkey tails a year,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 which is three times as much as the average American eats turkey in a total.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 I think they think is a real problem, don't they?

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Because they do have an obesity problem in some of their islands.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 And it's because there's so much fat in these turkey tails.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 Basically, yeah.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 They really want to stop importing quite so much, I think.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 They eat a lot of mutton flaps, too.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 Did they?

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 That's the thing that New Zealand exports, which is a very fatty bit of the cheap, basically.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 And they don't have teeth on them anymore, do they?

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 [laughter]

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 Oh dear.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 So another Disney film, which wasn't exactly true to life,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 was Pocahontas.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 And in Pocahontas, the male protagonist is John Smith, I understand, having not seen it.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 But all these things, I don't think are in the film.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 So he was a pirate's turn mercenary who fought the Turks in the Balkans.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 He was captured and sold into slavery.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 And was a slave for ages and ages before he beat his boss to death in a wheat field and escaped to Russia.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 And then because he was so famous as having escaped as a slave, he was invited to help establish the colony in America

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 where he was arrested for mutiny on his way.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 And then eventually he did get to America and then he did meet Pocahontas, I believe.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 But then had to return to England to recover from a gunpowder incident, which blew his genitals off.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 Ooh.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 So he's got no genitals throughout the whole movie.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 No, this is not in the movie all this time.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 No, no, but like underneath the clothes.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 Again, I must stress, this is not in the movie.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 No, no, no, surely it must be the pre genital.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 Yeah, this is when he's sent back to England after all the stuff is happening in America.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 But if he couldn't make it with Pocahontas when he had genitals, it's not like he would have stood a chance when he didn't.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 I guess that's why.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 These are according to his memoirs, he said all this.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 And historians do assume that they were a total fiction.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 Oh. However, one historian, Philip Barber, has said that nothing that he's written has yet been found to be a lie.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 So it could be true, it could be not true.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 Okay.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 The story of Cinderella is a bit more terrifying than the one that we know from Disney.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 I kind of love Disney because they took all the Grimm's fairy tales that are grotesque and made them really child-friendly.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 But in the original Cinderella, the evil stepsist is when they want to fit into the shoes just resort to cutting off bits of their feet.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 So I think one of them cuts off her own toes and one of them cuts off her own heel.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 And they're caught apparently because of the blood dripping from the shoes.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:09.000
 Although I would have thought it would be quite obvious if you put your foot into a shoe that you've either got no toes or no heel.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 You would have thought he noticed anyway.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 Well, if you just get someone to turn up wearing the shoe, I guess you might not.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 It depends on whether the prince is trying to witness the whole shoe fitting process.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 I think what happens is that the prince walks around with a shoe and he tries to put it directly onto people's feet, doesn't he?

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 He like kneels down and they give them his feet.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 I guess I know.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 They give them their feet.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 I see what you're saying because if they went into a dressing room and then quickly chopped off the toes of the merge.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 If the hungry sisters took the shoe and said, "I'm sure I will be able to fit into this, just give me one second."

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 And they pop into the kitchen.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 Oh!

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 Just pick the socks to go with it.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 I think I'll pick the red ones.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 Yeah, the grim version, they also had, they stopped the sisters coming to the wedding by having pigeons peck out their eyes.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 What?

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 It was a lot more.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 Why are they not allowed to come to the wedding?

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 The battle is lost at that point for the sisters.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 They're still screaming an agony from the toe thing, they've ruined the vibe.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 Just don't sit in an invitation to the sisters.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 How about that?

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
 Invite them to the evening, baby.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 But we all know the thing with the wedding is you can only have a certain number of guests.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 And at one stage you have to draw the light and everyone else gets the right peck out.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 Okay, that's it.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000
 That's all of our facts.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 Thank you so much for listening.

 Yeah, or you can go to our group account which is @nosuchthing or our website.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 We have everything up there from all of our previous episodes to links to buying our books.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000
 And there's also our behind the scenes documentary Behind the Gills.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 Check that out.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 Okay, we'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 We'll see you then.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 Goodbye.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:19.000
 Do you know how the eels feed themselves on the 3000 mile journey back to the Sargasso Sea?

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 They keep themselves going by consuming their own bones.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 So their spine loses 65% of its volume and the skull loses 50% of its volume.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 And they break down these bone cells called osteocytes.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 And they use them to get the minerals and the nutrients they need.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 Okay, because they do, yeah, they lose all their teeth in their stomach and their digestive system.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 So I suppose they just have to defile their bones.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000
 That would be like, if we were born as adults and ended as a baby.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 A baby isn't an adult without bones.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 And you've got a child.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 No, no, but I'm talking to you.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 They have, they have more bones than adults.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 So it's not like that.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 I mean, born as a baby and ending as an adult.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 It's good to know which way rounds.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 That is.
