 [band playing]

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Chazinski, and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Starting with fact number one, that's my fact.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 My fact is, in 1996, a wind surfer successfully broke into Alcatraz prison while it was hosting the movie premiere of The Rock, a film about people trying to break into Alcatraz.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Wow, that's good.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 So he broke into the prison.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 This is a guy called Jeff Bunch, and he was a wind surfer who was on the outskirts of it, and he wanted to go, so he wore a sort of tuxedo over his wetsuit, and he got to the island.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Over his wetsuit? I know, a bit weird, right? I guess he didn't plan on falling in, so if you don't fall in, you're dry.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I guess so. That is sensible, actually, yeah. Because actually James Bunch does it the wrong way, doesn't he? Like he has wetsuit over his tuxedo, doesn't he?

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 And then he has to go to the changing room. He's wide-a-pound to put it in the locker, take his wetsuit off.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 And it actually doesn't make any sense because the wetsuit doesn't stop you getting wet underneath, so actually when he reveals a tuxedo, James Bunch, it should be drenched.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Yeah, I started to wonder if that scene in the movie had just made it up.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 So this guy did it the right way around. He wanted to get to the premiere.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Yeah, he wanted to get to the premiere, and supposedly he did. He was arrested and taken off premises, but he said he managed to get a cocktail with Sean Connery.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 So I haven't seen the rock.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 What? I know, but I gather it's Michael Bay's best film.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Well, I gather that in a crowded field of other films, Michael Bay has made.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Better than Transformers 3?

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I know, I know, I know, it's a controversial opinion. I've read, I've read a thing saying it says, I think it's supposed to be quite good, isn't it?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 I love it. Yeah, okay.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 It's an awesome movie, and I think it's his favourite movie that he's made.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 All I saw was it, I got 66% on Rotten Tomatoes, which to me is definitely not worth this.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Yeah, but to Michael Bay, that is an absolute triumph.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 It's real Michael Bay slamming today.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 It's awesome.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Okay, so it is about, and it has Sean Connery in it, and it has apparently Navy Seals trying to break into the island in the film, and they use real Navy Seals.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 In the production, didn't they?

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Absolutely, so just for anyone who doesn't know the movie, which apparently no one does.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 The idea is that many, many years ago, someone successfully escaped from Alcatraz, and he was put in prison when he was caught on the other side.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 He's been in solitary confinement for years, and suddenly the rock, as he is known, is taken over by a bunch of militaries, people have gone rogue.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 So they need to break back into it, and they get this guy, Sean Connery, out of jail, to help them back in with Nicholas Cage.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 That's the basic premise, so the rock is in it.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 The rock is not in it, the island plays the role of the rock in it.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Alcatraz is known as the rock.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 This party sounds really cool, actually.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 There were 500 guests, and they were told to dress in formally, this is according to an article I read in SF Gate, and Patricia Raquette was there,

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 and she was wearing a chocolate brown, 3/4 length satin coat, with matching pants by Dolce and Gabbana, and an aqua silk blouse that matched her iridescent eyeshadow.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 So that was her dressing in formally.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And Sean Connery was wearing a tan parker, a fisherman sweater, and no toupee.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 No toupee, according to SF Gate.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 That's the dress down Friday.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 You never get asked on the red carpet, and who's toupee are you wearing tonight?

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 He was a tiny little funny fact, I found, about the actual making of the rock.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 The script was done, but they brought in some writers to sort of punch up the script, add some jokes, but also to do some rewrites.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And the two people they brought in, with the guys who wrote "poorage", the British sitcom.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Wow!

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 This is a Michael Bay action, and yeah, the creator of the "Likely Lads" came into the script.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 That's a great bit of trivia.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 So the rock of Alcatraz, this is not the only time that a former criminal from Alcatraz has gone back to it.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I think that happens fictionally in the film, but it's happened in real life as well.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 So they're pretty sure that Whitey Bulger, he was a gangster, he was involved in lots of murders, not a nice guy.

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 He was there for four years when it was operating as a prison.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And then later on, he went back as a tourist.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 He went there with a girlfriend.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Really?

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And he did a girlfriend just take you back to my old house.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Well, when they were there, they did all the tourist stuff.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 So he dressed up in a striped uniform.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 What is that you do?

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Wow.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And he had a photo taken behind a set of replica bars.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 That is a nice one.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 When was this?

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Because he wasn't here in the ages ago.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 I think he was in the late 60s, early 70s.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And he went back?

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 He was close in the 60s, didn't it?

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 62.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Ah, okay, my six degree was close.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Okay, but he went back, obviously later, when it was a tourist attraction.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Yeah, I wonder what date you bring up that you were far back Alcatraz.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Yeah, person.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I think it's on the Tinder profile.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 It's quite right, or else.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Because if you were going out with someone who'd been in Alcatraz,

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 that would be a really cool little thing to say about your boyfriend, wouldn't it?

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And you'd want to go there and experience it.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 You think that's a cool thing to say?

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 My boyfriend was at Alcatraz, the most secure for the worst of worst criminals?

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 It's not actually for the worst of worst criminals.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 That is a bit of a misconception.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Really?

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 So that would be the first thing I said about my boyfriend when someone said that.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Although White Ability was involved in 19 murders.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 So I don't know if he's in minimum security.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Maybe that didn't come up to the third date.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Some of them were just tax avoiders.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Like Al Capone.

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 So this is the thing.

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 The real mixed ability prison, isn't it?

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 The thing with the Alcatraz was really was a prison to cure people who were in other prisons

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 who kept on trying to break out or misbehaving,

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 pulling pranks on the prison officers, that kind of thing.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Pulling pranks.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Yeah, like trying to kill them.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 So that's why it's kind of a amusing idea in a way.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Because basically, that's what it was.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 My boyfriend Whitey, we say murderies.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 More of a prankster, really.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 He was about guilty of 17 pranks.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 So it's basically a prison of people who had experience of escaping from other prisons.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 So in fact, I think the most famous escape probably was of Frank Morris

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 and John and Clarence Anglin.

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And they inspired the film Escape from Alcatraz, the 1979 film.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And they got out in 1962.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 But they'd all come there because they'd escaped or attempted to escape other prisons.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And their escape is incredible, isn't it?

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 It's unbelievable.

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 So I just read the count of Monte Cristo and I thought this is implausible.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Everything he does to get out.

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 So they chipped away at their cell walls with spoons for ages.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And then they would conceal their work with kind of painted cardboard that they'd access somehow.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 They made an improvised drill from a vacuum cleaner.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Which I mean, how do you do that?

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And somehow they disguise the noise of the vacuum cleaner working as a drill

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 by having one of them play the accordion the whole time.

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 They should have played the spoons.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Well, the spoon was busy.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Oh, I'm sorry.

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Who's letting them get all this stuff, though?

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 I mean, who's letting the accordion in, I think, is the big question.

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Well, they had a band there.

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Alcapone was part of the band.

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 One of the famous prisoners.

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Yeah, I think he was on banjo or something like that.

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 He was.

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 He started the band, I think.

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 So this was way, way before this escape, wasn't it, in the 30s when Alcapone was there?

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Yeah.

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 It was a very long-running band.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And I guess it's very easy to do a reunion tour,

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 because you're all still in Alcapone.

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 So more on this escape, we didn't get to the end of it.

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Oh, they had papier-mache.

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 They made papier-mache heads of themselves.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And they made it, not, they didn't have actual papier-mache.

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 They had to use toilet paper and soap.

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And they made these, they sculpted these heads of themselves.

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And then they covered them in real hair,

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 which they got from the prison barber shop.

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Brilliant. Yeah. So good.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 They stole over 50 raincoats.

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Again, don't know where they're getting 50 raincoats probably.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 They stole these raincoats and they made them into makeshift life jackets.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 And they vulcanized them properly using steam pipes in the prison.

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 They worked this out from some kind of magazine they'd had smuggled in.

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And they also, I think, converted one of them into a life raft.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And apparently they converted a musical instrument, according to the FBI,

150
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 into a tool to inflate the life raft.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Oh, and you just use the accordion, you squeeze it up and down, don't you?

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 That sounds like the one, doesn't it?

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 But then they'll hear you blowing up the heat.

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 It can't be that.

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 In fact, the whole point of musical instruments is they all make a noise when you pass wind through them.

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 True.

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 I went on the FBI website and they said that they officially closed the case

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 on December 31st, 1979, about this escape.

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 But they have turned the responsibility over to the US Marshal Service who continue to investigate.

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 So if you at home have any leads or information to share about this escape from 1962,

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 then please call Deputy US Marshal Michael Dyke on 415-436-7677.

162
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Do you cop?

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 He thinks they made it.

164
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 He doesn't make it to the mainland, definitely.

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 And that they made it away because some people think that the raft, which was made of raincoats,

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 and it was also made of cement.

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 That was the other ingredient, because they're often raincoats and cement.

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 But he thinks they got away.

169
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 And the family of the Anglin brothers, two of the escapees,

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 they think that they attended their mother's funeral.

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Really?

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Yeah, because their mother died several years later.

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 But obviously, the funeral was place was crawling with FBI agents,

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 and they think they might have attended dressed as women.

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 And all three of them will be pardoned.

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 But only if they make it to the age of 100.

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 There was a team of Dutch scientists who did some computer simulations

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 about whether the rafts would have made it to the mainland.

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 They launched 50 virtual rafts every half hour between 8pm and 4am

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 by looking at all the tides that would have happened at the time,

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 and from different locations on the island.

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 And they found that if they left it exactly midnight on the night,

183
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 they might have made it.

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 They would have been sucked out towards a golden gate bridge,

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 but at the moment they were close to the golden gate,

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 the tide would have reversed, and that would have sent them to the north side of the bridge,

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 and they would have been able to get to the land.

188
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Wow.

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 And that's the only specific time.

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Every other time they would have got sucked out to sea.

191
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 But this is assuming that they weren't just there controlling the rafts, right?

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Yes, they did actually put into the computer that they might be able to do some steering.

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Because they had some oars, they made a couple of oars.

194
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 They did have a couple of oars, but they were both made out of accordion.

195
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 [laughter]

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 On the escaping via the only method through the ocean,

197
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 there was a theory that so Alcatraz was meant to be actually quite a pleasant experience

198
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 in terms of food, in terms of their showers.

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 They had hot showers.

200
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Prisons don't really have that.

201
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Prisons are strong words, we should clarify.

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Well, maybe it's not, it wasn't such awful.

203
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Yeah.

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 You got your own cell, which actually was, according to a bunch of people who've written about it

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 since having come out saying that that's a really pleasant experience, not to be...

206
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 I think what I'm saying is it's like pleasant experience, compared to being in prison.

207
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 No, yeah.

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 It's not unobjectively pleasant experience.

209
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 It's like saying that the rock is a good movie, compared to the other Michael Bay movies.

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Yes, yes, okay.

211
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 No, that's sound.

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 But you know why they had hot showers?

213
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Well, this is, yeah, I was about to say, because of the ocean.

214
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 So the theory was that they were so used to hot water

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 that when they got into the ocean, that would immediately give them hypothermia.

216
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Or they wouldn't be used to it as opposed to cold showers, getting them used to a cold swim.

217
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 It is swimmable, so people have swum.

218
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 So I think in, oh, when was it?

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 It was, the year before the prison opened actually, a 17-year-old girl swam it in 47 minutes.

220
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Wow.

221
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 And she's not even the youngest person who had done it.

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Obviously, you need to be very lucky with the currents and the tides, because it's pretty treacherous.

223
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 But in 2006, a seven-year-old boy swam it.

224
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 No.

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Also in 47 minutes.

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 What?

227
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Isn't that crazy?

228
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Wow.

229
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Do you think that maybe it's like, you know when you go to a water park, and there's that ride where you just sit in a ring

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 and it just takes you around in exactly 47 minutes?

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 It seems like there must be just a current that switches on once a day, and that just takes pretty much helps.

232
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Some of the people who are in Alcatraz?

233
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Yeah.

234
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Basil Banghart, he was known as the owl, because he had big eyes.

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Ellsworth Raymond Johnson was known as Bumpy, because he had a bump on the back of his head.

236
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And Joseph Bowers was known as Dutch, because he was born in Austria.

237
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Pigeonably, they just, they heard he was European and just gave that so funny.

238
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Okay, it is tied for fact number two, and that is Andy.

239
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 My fact is that Horatio Nelson had a brother whose name was Suckling Nelson.

240
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 So, not the most heroic of the Nelson siblings?

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 No, it feels like he was given a shot shrift in life, wasn't he?

242
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Yeah.

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 By getting that name.

244
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Definitely.

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 He was never going to become the head of a baby.

246
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Well, maybe it means he was the only one who was breastfed.

247
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Do we know if that was the reason?

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 That was not the reason.

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Right.

250
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 That was a great theory.

251
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 So this fact actually comes from, friend of the podcast, Carrie Adloid, who sent it to me saying,

252
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 "You're the only person who will find this interesting."

253
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 That's great. So it's because of the Suckling side of the family.

254
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 So his mother was called Catherine Suckling.

255
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Okay.

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 And she had a brother called Morris Suckling.

257
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And so, Nelson was one of 11 children, eight of whom survived Adloidhood.

258
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 So a lot of siblings, and I think they were running a bit short of names.

259
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 And Suckling was one of the last brothers born.

260
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 And he was not very impressive, I think.

261
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 So there's almost no references to him in biographies of Nelson.

262
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 One of them just describes him as the feckless Suckling.

263
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 He was a struggling Vicka, and Nelson got him a job.

264
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 He was a draper in Beckles, who tried to be a draper, but failed.

265
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And then he became a Vicka when his father, who was a Vicka retired.

266
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 And he became the Vicka, and then he died a few years later.

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And I don't think he was very close to Horatio Nelson, because Horatio wrote to his wife in 1799,

268
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 "I am not surprised at my brother's death.

269
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Three are dead younger than myself."

270
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 That was his response to the death of his brother.

271
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Oh, God.

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 He died quite young.

273
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 And actually his father, so their father, wrote to Kitty,

274
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 who was Nelson's sister, about Suckling.

275
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 He will no doubt pass amongst a crowd of undistinguished preachers

276
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 and gain some respect in the village from his quiet disposition,

277
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 his liking to a little conviviality and his passion for Greyhound racing.

278
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Wow.

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Got this podcast that turned into a roaster.

280
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Poor guy.

281
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Dead for ages brought back finally via Carried.

282
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 I know.

283
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 We've been taken down again.

284
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 The name Suckling came from the surname of the family,

285
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 which comes from the word to suck.

286
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 And in ancient times it was a baptismal or patronomic name of endearment.

287
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 So it's like how you have the surname darling.

288
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Okay.

289
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 There's a poet called Sir John Suckling.

290
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Yeah, yeah.

291
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Do you know what?

292
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 So I was reading about Sir John Suckling.

293
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And he's related directly.

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 So he was an English poet.

295
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 He wrote ballad upon a wedding.

296
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 He also is credited as having invented the card game "Cribbage".

297
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Really?

298
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Yeah.

299
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 I studied Sir John Suckling at school.

300
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Did you?

301
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Yeah, he was one of this group called the Cavalier Poets,

302
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 who are a lot of sort of roistering lads who are all in favor of King Charles.

303
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 I think you've mentioned him before.

304
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 I think so.

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And the poet ballad upon a wedding contains one of the early masturbation joke.

306
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Look, that's it.

307
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 I don't mind it.

308
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Yes.

309
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 It's not in the ceremony.

310
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Do you have the joke?

311
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 I think it's talking about how beautiful the bride is.

312
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And it's saying that if so hard I had a wife.

313
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 I think it's saying that if the groom had slept with the bride,

314
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 as often as all the sort of invited male friends had imagined themselves doing it,

315
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 it would have spoiled him surely.

316
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Wow.

317
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Is that a masturbation joke?

318
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Yeah, because they're all imagining that they're sleeping with her.

319
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Of course, sorry.

320
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Yes.

321
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Anyway.

322
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Yeah, but he was probably the most dominant of the Sucklings.

323
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 It's thanks to the Sucklings that Nelson went to see in the first place,

324
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 because it was the Nelson's uncle Morris Suckling,

325
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 who, when Nelson's mother Catherine died,

326
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Nelson was only, I think, eight or ten years old who was quite used very young.

327
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And Uncle Morris said, well, I'll take one of the children off your hands.

328
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 And that happened to be Horatio.

329
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And then Morris got command of a ship.

330
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 And Nelson wrote to him saying, take me to sea.

331
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Please, I want to go to sea.

332
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 I want to go and have a ventures.

333
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 So that's how he got into the Navy.

334
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 He could have been a draper.

335
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Car.

336
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 A missed opportunity.

337
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 We could have such amazing curtains.

338
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 You could have Suckling's column.

339
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 The thing about his mother, that he remembers.

340
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 So I got his mother died when he was nine.

341
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 So I like you skirted around that with eight and ten.

342
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Between eight and ten.

343
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 So I think his mother died when he was either eight or nine or ten.

344
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And he said to you remember, well, he claimed to remember her well.

345
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 But then the only concrete thing he said to you remember about her was that she hated the French.

346
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 It's the whole thing, just an attempt to police his mum.

347
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 It sounds like it might be.

348
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 The whole thing.

349
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 He was not very impressive in adulthood.

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I mean, to crowds who were observing it.

351
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Horatio Nelson.

352
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Horatio, yeah, yeah.

353
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 So crowds thought he was rubbish.

354
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 He was very short and a German onlooker who had crowd.

355
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 It said, "A more miserable collection of bones and a wizard frame I have never yet come across."

356
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Out.

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 I know.

358
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Yeah, but he had the crap kicked out of him at war.

359
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 He lost an arm.

360
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 He lost an arm.

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Yeah, this isn't a guy who had a hernia.

362
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 There you go.

363
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 You can't see that on the outside, though, can you?

364
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 You can.

365
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 If you put your top off, but I don't think he did not.

366
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Although he was very good at his own PR, so if he had a six pack.

367
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 And he also invented the phrase "The Nelson Touch" to...

368
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 What does that mean?

369
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 It's about having some kind of brilliant naval strategy.

370
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 It's amazing.

371
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And people use it, you know, even today in the Navy.

372
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Yeah, yeah, it's a phrase.

373
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 It's not used much outside navies, I think.

374
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 No.

375
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 If we talked about Lady Hamilton.

376
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 No.

377
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Or Emma Hamilton and stuff.

378
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 So Nelson was married to Fanny and then decided to leave her for Emma Hamilton,

379
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 who was married to William Hamilton at the time.

380
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 And Nelson was sending love letters to Emma Hamilton.

381
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 But William Hamilton knew the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,

382
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 so was opening all of his mail and reading whatever he was saying and sending it to the government.

383
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 So whenever he was sending letters like to Emma Hamilton saying,

384
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 "I kissed you fervently and we enjoyed the height of love.

385
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Emma, I pour out my soul to you."

386
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Her husband was reading all that stuff, and I guess scanning over it and getting to the important naval stuff.

387
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 So he completely knew about the whole thing.

388
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 But then of course they ended up living in some kind of weird manacia time.

389
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Yeah.

390
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 They lived in the same house, was it?

391
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Yeah.

392
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 They've seemed pretty open by the end of it.

393
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Everyone was kind of cool with it.

394
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 It was a very modern sort of force.

395
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And Fanny seemed not to have too much of an issue.

396
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And...

397
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 They had a really unhappy marriage with him as well.

398
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Yeah.

399
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 So I think it was probably a relief for both of them when he bugled off with the lady.

400
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 If they kept the family surname, if she could have been called Fanny Suckling.

401
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Oh, that would have been the dream, wouldn't it?

402
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Actually as well, Emma Hamilton used to call Fanny Tom Titt as a nickname.

403
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 So she could have been Tom Titt Suckling.

404
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Titt Suckling.

405
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Oh God.

406
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 And that was because it was really not very nice.

407
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 So she suffered from rheumatism in her legs and supposedly walked a bit like a bird.

408
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And so Emma Hamilton being a bit not very nice.

409
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 That's catchy.

410
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 It's a bit Rebecca Vardy, isn't it?

411
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Yeah.

412
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 I read a really random thing about Fanny Nisbit.

413
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 So before she married Nelson, she was guardian to these three children

414
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 who were the kids of a plantation owner who was away in the Caribbean with his wife.

415
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And Tim and his wife returned and Fanny Nisbit's looking after these kids.

416
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 And Fanny brought the three kids in to say, "Hey, his daddy."

417
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And T said, "Who are north of these children?"

418
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And she Fanny said, "Good God, don't you know them? You know, didn't recognise his own kids. They're your children."

419
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 And so neither of the couple had recognised their own children.

420
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And it said that his wife was so surprised that she set her headdress on fire on a nearby candle.

421
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 What?

422
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 That story.

423
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 It's really random.

424
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 It's just so random.

425
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 It's like, you come home.

426
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 You must know you have three children.

427
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 So when three children stabbed in front of you?

428
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Yeah.

429
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 There's a process of deduction going on there, isn't it?

430
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 He would have thought she hadn't figured it out.

431
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 She was astonished.

432
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Did she set her headdress on fire deliberately as a protest against the looks of these children?

433
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Or did she stagger back into a candle?

434
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 It's not clear. It's written in letter by her husband and he doesn't specify.

435
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 He just says she set her headdress on fire.

436
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 That's an amazing start.

437
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 It's like an episode of Miranda.

438
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 You know the Hardy.

439
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Kiss Me Hardy.

440
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 People have mentioned before his dying words. Kiss Me Hardy to one of his officers.

441
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 He later became First Lord of the Admiralty. He did really well in his career.

442
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 It was cool.

443
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Yeah. But this is amazing.

444
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 The Nelson's and the Hardy's are still in touch as a family.

445
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Wow.

446
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Yeah. So there was a dinner party in 1990 and there was a woman they called Mary Arthur.

447
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 She is descended from Nelson.

448
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And her husband was talking to one of the other guests and said,

449
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 "Oh, this is my wife. She is a descendant of Nelson."

450
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And the person they were talking to, Robyn Stena said,

451
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 "That's funny. I'm descended from Hardy."

452
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 And they got back in touch that way.

453
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Wow.

454
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 They're not having known each other. They've been in touch since then.

455
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And they became really good friends.

456
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And the time's right about it. The time said,

457
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 "Mrs Arthur, who lives in Wobern in Bedfordshire,

458
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 confirmed that the two descendants continue the family's tradition of kissing."

459
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Nice.

460
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 It sounds like it's all an excuse for them to have an affair.

461
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 I don't think that is a good rule.

462
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 I think he said,

463
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 "I'm a descendant of Hardy."

464
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And she said,

465
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 "Kiss Me Hardy."

466
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 And then they crossed the table and snogged.

467
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 And the husband can't say anything because they're just reenacting the historic scene.

468
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Yeah.

469
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 I think that's a really bad story.

470
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

471
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 And that is James.

472
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that in the 11th century,

473
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 hundreds of people in the UK paid their rent in eels.

474
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Okay, so this is a website run by a guy called John Wyatt Greenley.

475
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 He's a historian whose work, according to his site,

476
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 examines the cultural history of eels in England

477
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 from the 10th through the 17th centuries,

478
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 focusing on eels' role in economic change,

479
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 the growth of a national English identity

480
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 and the evolution of spatial practice in early modern London.

481
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And that was a quote that was a lot longer than I thought it was going to be this afternoon.

482
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 But he has a bit where he looks at rents that were paid in eels.

483
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And this was a thing that happened probably before the 10th century,

484
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 but that's where we have the records from.

485
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 For instance, a Doomsday book records payments

486
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 like the village of Hamston, who owed Earl Hugh 75,000 eels per year for their rent.

487
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 So much.

488
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Dead or alive?

489
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I think dead.

490
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Okay.

491
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 It's harder to collect.

492
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 I suppose live eels.

493
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Yes, it is easier to collect.

494
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 No, it is an Andy. Come on.

495
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I'll tell you why.

496
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 If there are 10 dead eels on the floor and 10 live eels in a bucket,

497
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 let's see you can pick them up quickest.

498
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Okay, it's easier to collect dead eels, but it's harder to find them, I think.

499
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 How does it find dead eels?

500
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 It's harder to find dead eels lying around.

501
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Yeah, the natural state is alive.

502
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Yeah.

503
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 I do get that.

504
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Presumably the eel farmers, right?

505
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 It's not people going around looking for dead eels.

506
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 No, no, no. You can't farm an eel.

507
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 You can't farm an eel.

508
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 You can't farm an eel.

509
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 No.

510
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 This was basically people catching them and then selling them at market

511
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 and then picking them up and using the most kind of currency.

512
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Oh, wow.

513
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Because they come on sticks. So you get 25 eels on a stick.

514
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 So when you had to give 75,000 eels, it would be what, 3000 sticks.

515
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 What?

516
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 It was sort of like the equivalent of candy floss or something.

517
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 You'd take a stick of eels.

518
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Yeah.

519
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 And lick away at it.

520
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 I'm well, I'm not sure about the licking part.

521
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Well, they were ranked collectors so keen on eel.

522
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Well, was it just a huge surplus of eels?

523
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 It's popular food.

524
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Yeah?

525
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 It is popular food.

526
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 So John White Greenley says that the reason that he looks into this is

527
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 actually if you look in the Doomsday book, those payments in pigs,

528
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 in fish, in ale, you might pay in different foods and drinks.

529
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Because if you don't have cash, you know, it's a thing that everyone has.

530
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 But people these days are really particularly interested in eels

531
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 because we don't really eat eels anymore.

532
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 So when you look at a list and it says 75,000 eels,

533
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 you go bloody hell.

534
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 When you get 75,000 eels from, you can't farm an eel.

535
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Well, I had an eel for breakfast at the weekend.

536
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Did you really?

537
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Yeah, smoked eel.

538
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 So we don't eat eels anymore?

539
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 No, no, I had no eels.

540
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 I had complex, but what I'm saying is less common.

541
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 I didn't have, yeah, 75,000 eels.

542
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 But there used to be, maybe it was just there was a lot more.

543
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 So I think 50% of the biomass of European freshwater

544
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 or some parts of it was made of eels.

545
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 You're kidding.

546
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 In the olden days.

547
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Wow.

548
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 That's the olden days.

549
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 I don't have an exact year.

550
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 But around this time.

551
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Back in the days before the fends were drained.

552
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 It was very rich eel territory.

553
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 You know, you'd go boating around the waters.

554
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 And this guy, John Wyatt Greenley, he's brilliant.

555
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Yeah.

556
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 His Twitter name is surprised eel historian.

557
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Yeah.

558
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 And then the biography for him says surprised historian.

559
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Not surprised eels.

560
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 He's a medievalist at Cornell University.

561
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 And he's done a map.

562
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 He's done an interactive map of the UK.

563
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 And you can look on it.

564
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And you can click to see where your nearest local eel rent was.

565
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And I looked and it's about four miles from where I grew up.

566
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Kingston.

567
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 There was a rent of 125 eels.

568
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Wow.

569
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Yeah.

570
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 It's really interesting.

571
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 My closest was Manchester.

572
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Nice.

573
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Oh, I didn't.

574
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 I just was busy looking at his replies to that tweet.

575
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Because it was so successful.

576
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 He was like, oh my god.

577
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Who would have thought eels?

578
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 This is fantastic.

579
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 So he was a surprised eel historian.

580
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 He's done a kind of calculation of what eels would get you today

581
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 and today's money.

582
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 So he said that he worked out because he's at Cornell University,

583
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 that if you had to pay to go to Cornell University,

584
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 you would need between 106,612 and 213,024 eels,

585
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 either of which represents a number of eels

586
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 that the Cornell Burses office is ill-prepared to hand.

587
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 I mean, you'd say that an Amazon Prime membership,

588
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 which is $99 a year,

589
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 would cost only 150 to 300 eels.

590
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 That's about six to 12 sticks of eels.

591
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I really didn't know that you cannot eat eel raw.

592
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 So again, in sushi is kind of--

593
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Did you just find that this weekend?

594
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 I've had a very bad few days.

595
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 You got it in sushi, don't you?

596
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 You do, and it's always cooked.

597
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 So because if you eat it raw, it's got toxic blood.

598
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 And it causes your muscles to spasm, including your heart.

599
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 And it's got enough toxin that it can kill a human being.

600
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 If you suck all the blood out of an eel, you'll die.

601
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Yeah.

602
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Wow.

603
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 You deserve to as well.

604
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 But so that, if we're saying eels not eaten that much here

605
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 these days, in Japan, it's obviously massive.

606
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 They have an annual consumption rate of 100,000 tons of eels.

607
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 So that's 70% of the worldwide eel catch that we get.

608
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 But they've declined in their eel populations so massively.

609
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 So I'm like genuinely 99%, like that's how high it is.

610
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 So they now have to import eel, glass eel,

611
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 and so on from America in order to eat.

612
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 But also as a result, because they're manufacturing great sushi out there.

613
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 They get sent back to America.

614
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 The Americans are sending their eels over to then have it sent back to eat.

615
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 So it's taken two plane rides by the time they've eaten.

616
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 That's kind of nice in a way, because eels in their migration

617
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 are used to migrating thousands of kilometers.

618
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 They have this extraordinary migration.

619
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 So it's maybe it's sort of nice that, post-humusly,

620
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 they're still migrating thousands of miles back and forth.

621
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Do you think that's a little bit of consolation for the--

622
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 No, I don't think so.

623
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 No, I think so.

624
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 I mean, the population of Client is amazing.

625
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 So there are temporary bands that have been put in place in the UK.

626
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 And it's lots to do with dredging of the ocean as well.

627
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 This really just decimates the population.

628
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 But they hatch in the Sargasso Sea, which is West Indies way, Bermuda.

629
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 It's like North-- and it's not to see it.

630
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 It's a portion of the North Atlantic, isn't it?

631
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 So it's a portion of the ocean.

632
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 But then they drift over on the Gulf Stream when they're really tiny.

633
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 And then they borrow into river mouths and estuaries and things in the UK and across Europe.

634
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And then they stay there for up to 12 years.

635
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Some of them can live in a pool for up to 30 or 40 years, just living there and getting bigger.

636
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 And then they suddenly, they feel the call.

637
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 They swim back to the Sargasso Sea. They spawn, they die.

638
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Yeah.

639
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 We think.

640
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 We think.

641
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 No one's ever seen it happen.

642
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 No one's ever seen an eel spawn.

643
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 It's crazy.

644
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 It's insane.

645
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 So in the olden days, people like Pliny and all those other types,

646
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 until the 1700s kind of thought they came from nowhere.

647
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 And I kind of still think they do.

648
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Because no one's seen this one.

649
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 We found young eels, very young eels born in the Sargasso Sea, haven't we?

650
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And then we've got the old eels that look totally different, by the way, in Europe and America.

651
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 But that's it.

652
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 And they're constantly changing colors.

653
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 So when they spawn, they look like these tiny glass leaves.

654
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 And then they become transparent glass eels.

655
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 And then they turn into like noodle-looking things.

656
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 They go brown.

657
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Then they go yellow.

658
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Then they go silver.

659
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 It's this weird kind of disco effect.

660
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 And silver is the one where you know that they're going to start heading back to the Sargasso Sea to die.

661
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 What do they feel the cool?

662
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 We don't know that either.

663
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 We don't know.

664
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 And we do know that if you farm an eel, which you can't do these days, they have an eel farm.

665
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 They have an eel farm.

666
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 It is.

667
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 But if you like have an eel farm and you raise them there, so they were born there,

668
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 they still have the instinct to return to the Sargasso Sea, which is kind of embedded in them somehow.

669
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 So do they just jamming their heads into the edge of the pond in the direction of the Sargasso Sea?

670
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 I fear they might do that kind of thing.

671
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Wow.

672
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 They're really clever in the way they migrate as well.

673
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 So now we have fight scientists, not have actually tagged them.

674
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 But it's not like they haven't managed to tag them all the way into the migration.

675
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 I just...

676
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Come on, they're just not looking close enough for this spawn, are they?

677
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 I know.

678
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 I reckon if we go to the Sargasso Sea.

679
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Yeah.

680
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 Well, I think you can see the spawn.

681
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 You've just never seen the eel spawn it, right?

682
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 There was one day in a scientist who spent 15 years of his career looking in the mid-Atlantic

683
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 for seven millimeter long, um, larvae.

684
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 I mean, he never did.

685
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Yeah, but that...

686
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 I mean, it does feel like he's not done a very good job.

687
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 You surely look for the bigger ones on their way back to the Sargasso Sea.

688
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 You would look at the spawn and then you keep looking at it at earlier and earlier times

689
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 and then look at the bigger ones later at later times and eventually the two things must come together.

690
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Guys, it must be harder than it looks.

691
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Otherwise, I'm sure these people would have succeeded anyway.

692
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 So I was just saying that we have tagged them now.

693
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 So they've tagged them for about the first 1500 kilometers of their journey.

694
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 And what they found out is if you tag a European eel when it's going back to spawn,

695
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 it doesn't make a b-line for the Sargasso Sea.

696
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 It doesn't do the shortest route.

697
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 It heads a bit further south, so it heads towards where the Azores would be.

698
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And that's because they're smart enough to know that there are ocean currents

699
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 that they then pick up like a conveyor belt.

700
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 And that'll get them then much faster.

701
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 And that's any way they get their own tunnel.

702
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Boy off Alcatraz.

703
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Exactly.

704
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Wow.

705
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 That is amazing.

706
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 And they can just sit in it, not do anything.

707
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 So we've been looking as to how they spawn for centuries, right?

708
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 But it was only in the early 1900s that that was found.

709
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 And it was this guy that you're talking about.

710
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 It was a Danish biologist, Johann Schmidt.

711
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 And he was the one who pinpointed the Sargasso was the spot that they were doing it.

712
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 And he, I was just looking into him, he was married to a lady called Cool.

713
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 And he studied under a man called Warming.

714
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Very nice.

715
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Nice of that, yeah.

716
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 And so Cool was the daughter of the old Karlsburg brewery in Copenhagen,

717
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 the chief director there.

718
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 And actually the whole thing, the reason we know about this morning,

719
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 is Karlsburg itself sponsored him to go and look for it.

720
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 So it's thanks to Karlsburg beer that we know about this.

721
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Wow.

722
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And was he the 15 years guy?

723
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Yeah, that was probably not the best scientific study in the world.

724
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 And then this other guy, Warming, is a Danish botanist who is a founder of the scientific discipline of ecology.

725
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 He's the relationship of man and earth is called Warming, which is quite nice.

726
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Nice.

727
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 That's a really good scientific fact, sir.

728
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Thank you.

729
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 There is one reported case of a male dolphin masturbating by wrapping an electric eel around its penis.

730
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 What? How do we know it was masturbating?

731
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 He was thinking about John Suckling's wife at the time.

732
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 I mean, did it ejaculate at the end?

733
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 I don't know.

734
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 I haven't seen the video.

735
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 This is two personal questions.

736
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 I'm sorry, but if the dolphin is going to tell us it's been masturbated with an eel, then we want the details.

737
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 I don't know.

738
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 You're quite right.

739
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 The eel might have been trying to asphyxiate the penis.

740
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 Indeed.

741
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 Or have sex with it thinking it's another eel.

742
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Mm-hmm.

743
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 I don't know what happened.

744
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Speaking of members with eels wrapped around them.

745
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Good link.

746
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 There is an old tradition in the fends of England of using a wedding ring made of eel skin.

747
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Oh.

748
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 So that's another way you can wrap a bit of eel around yourself to symbolise a love match.

749
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Yeah.

750
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 That sounds very flimsy.

751
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Yeah, I don't know if it's the ring for life, but it's maybe the ring you use for wedding ceremony.

752
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 All of a sudden, you feel like it's your first husband kind of thing.

753
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Chuzinski.

754
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 My fact is that according to Polynesian mythology, Maui, who is the god in the Disney film Moana,

755
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 died by climbing into a goddess's vagina and being crushed to death by the obsidian teeth in there.

756
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 And they didn't show that in the film.

757
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Yeah.

758
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Yeah, we went to Disney and watched that film.

759
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Do you remember because we were sponsored by Moana?

760
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Yeah, that's right.

761
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 You guys were quite late getting in because you needed to remember you had to sign in or something like that.

762
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Yeah.

763
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 And so you missed a start of it, but I went in without signing in.

764
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 And they showed that scene.

765
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Oh, you get out of the top.

766
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Oh, God.

767
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 So show the death scene at the top, okay.

768
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 And then the rest is a flashback.

769
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Of course.

770
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 So if you did miss that first scene of the film, all the film.

771
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 You should know that this is the film Moana and Moana's sort of demigod sidekick in the film is Maui,

772
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 who was a real god, very important god in, or demigod in Pacific mythology.

773
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 And he exists all over the Pacific Islands.

774
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 So like Hawaii, he's very important.

775
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 But Tahiti's Samoa, the Maui people, they all have slightly different versions of him.

776
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 But there is a version where he's a real trickster character.

777
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 He's a prankster.

778
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 He's a prankster.

779
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 He's like Whitey Bulger or Al Capone.

780
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Yeah.

781
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 He's a prankster.

782
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 How much murderer?

783
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Does he murder anyone?

784
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 He doesn't actually.

785
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 He's just a little prankster.

786
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 And one of the ways he dies is when he's trying to become immortal.

787
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 And the way he decides to do this is to enter the goddess of death,

788
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 who's called Hine Nui Teppo, to get in through her vagina,

789
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 pluck out her heart on the way up to her mouth, and emerge from her mouth.

790
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 And apparently this will reverse the birth process and make him immortal.

791
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 I don't know if that's scientifically accurate.

792
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 But anyway, he does this.

793
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And he's got his bird friends with him.

794
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 So some birds who are his mates.

795
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 And he says, please don't laugh while I do this because it's your wake up.

796
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 And they couldn't hold it in because it's quite funny watching someone climb through a vagina.

797
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 And so she woke up.

798
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 And she tensed up.

799
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 And the little teeth in her vagina, which we all have,

800
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 crushed him to death.

801
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 Wow.

802
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 She's quite a starry.

803
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 She's really, she's described us.

804
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 Did you say that she's the goddess of death?

805
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Yes.

806
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Oh, wait, or a mortality.

807
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 I think death and mortality, yeah.

808
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 Okay.

809
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 She's got very vivid description in the mist.

810
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 She's got eyes of green stone, hair of kelp,

811
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 and the mouth of a baracuda.

812
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 Mm.

813
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 Of as well as, of course, having a toothy fanny.

814
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 She has a vagina, a bit like a moray eel.

815
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 They've got really big teeth, haven't they?

816
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 Oh, they do.

817
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 They've got like a pharyngeal jaw, like alien.

818
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Oh, yeah.

819
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 And they've got backwards teeth, so that if you accidentally

820
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 swim in the mouth, you can't swim out again.

821
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Oh, gosh.

822
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 Grammar, what big teeth you have.

823
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 And then what a surprising location.

824
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 So Maui, I don't think you're mowing.

825
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Well, actually, we said that he didn't, his pranks didn't kill anyone.

826
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 And I think that is true, perhaps.

827
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 I don't know of any that did.

828
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 But he did once go fishing with a guy called Arawaru,

829
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 who was a husband of his sister.

830
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 He was so annoyed with Arawaru that he turned him into a dog.

831
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 Oh.

832
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 And that was the first ever dog.

833
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 And that's where dogs come from.

834
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 Because Maui, actually, if you know the song from Joanna,

835
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 you're welcome, which is his big song.

836
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 It's all about the things which he did.

837
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 So he created the moon and the sun and the wind and all these different things.

838
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 He pulled the islands up from the ocean floor, didn't he?

839
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 He had a magic jawbone, which, according to some of the myths,

840
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 is the jawbone of his grandmother.

841
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 He's also quite big, so she must have been huge.

842
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 And he did things with useful things with it.

843
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 So he used it as a fish hook to pull up islands from the ocean floor.

844
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 And actually, the names of North Island and South Island in New Zealand now

845
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 are Teika, our Maui, and Tewaka, our Maui, which means fish of Maui and canoe of Maui.

846
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 Oh.

847
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 Because that's from when he caught a fish and turned it into an island.

848
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 And he turned his canoe into another island.

849
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 That's what was turning stuff into islands.

850
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 That's great.

851
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 That was the sky. That was the thing he did.

852
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 The sky was pressed down close to the earth.

853
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 So the height of a tall tree, it was pressed right down to there.

854
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 So it was obviously very restrictive for everybody.

855
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 And he just lifted it up and ran to a very high peak and chucked it up in the air.

856
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 That would be so annoying if the sky was that low, wouldn't it?

857
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Yeah.

858
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 So it wouldn't hit your head on it.

859
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 But you would be able to fly a drone.

860
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 You wouldn't be able to fly a drone.

861
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 Nightmare.

862
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 Nightmare.

863
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 So another character in Moana is Tafisi, who's got a goddess who comes up at the end.

864
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 She's actually based on Pele, who is a genuine goddess in Hawaiian mythology.

865
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 And so she's like the most important goddess, goddess of volcanoes, and stuff like that.

866
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 It's like the big volcano in Hawaii is called Mount Pele, or Pele, I think.

867
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 Yes.

868
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 And that's kind of her embodiment, is that right?

869
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 Yeah.

870
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 You're meant to pay tribute to it when you go there.

871
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 I went there and I did it.

872
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 Did you not?

873
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 No.

874
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 I wonder you got this cold for so long.

875
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 You're meant to give, I think it's brandy, I think it is.

876
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 You go, you go and you go and pour gin for Pele.

877
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 She loves gin.

878
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 Yeah.

879
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 There was a hog god, called Kamapua-a, which I'm sure I'm pronouncing wrong.

880
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 But he married Pele, the fire goddess.

881
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 And his habits were so bad because he was a hog that she couldn't cope.

882
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 They had huge arguments and eventually she won all the arguments and he was forced to surrender

883
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 and turned himself into a fish.

884
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 Oh.

885
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 And that is a Hawaiian fish.

886
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 And it's the Hawaiian fish with the best name.

887
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 I think we might have talked about it before.

888
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 Oh, the really long name.

889
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 Yeah, I can't, I'm going to have a crack in it.

890
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 It's called the Huma-Huma-Nuku-Nuku-Apua-a.

891
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 And it makes this grunting noise, which apparently sounds a bit like a hog.

892
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 Which is because it used to be a hog when he was a hog.

893
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 That was always a relationship that was going to fail between a volcano and a hog, wasn't it?

894
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 It's a one way trip to a barbecue, basically.

895
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 Can we talk about having teeth in vaginas?

896
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 Oh, sure.

897
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 Yeah.

898
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 Because this is an extremely common myth around the world, around the whole world.

899
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 In fact, there are 22 variants of this is called vagina-dentata myth in North American cultures alone.

900
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 The Wichita one has a toothed vagina wandering at the round at night, castrating men in their sleep.

901
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 The mandiruku myth has a woman with a vagina like a crocodile's mouth.

902
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 In Irissa, in India, the myth has the toothed vagina, not only castrating men, but also eating the rice crop causing famine.

903
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 Oh, really?

904
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 And it's basically a misogynistic way of saying that women are evil and you should stay away from them.

905
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Right.

906
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 Wow.

907
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 I don't know.

908
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 I thought it was like an empowering woman.

909
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 You know, we get to chop off men's penises without vaginas if we want to.

910
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 Yeah.

911
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 I immediately bought it to the misogynist.

912
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 I was like greedy vagina.

913
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 Yeah.

914
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 I'm afraid.

915
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 In most of the time, it is quite misogynistic.

916
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 Very occasionally, you get one where the woman is empowered in the story.

917
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 So in the chukchi myths, which is in northern Siberia, you have a woman who is married to an old man

918
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 and to avoid having sex with him.

919
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 She puts a fish head in her vagina so the teeth will cut him every time he tries to have sex.

920
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 Right.

921
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 And she takes the piss out of him, doesn't she?

922
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 He has sex with her the first time.

923
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 He's like, "Oh my gosh, there are teeth in there."

924
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 And then she's like, "I can't believe we didn't know all vaginas have teeth."

925
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 How embarrassing.

926
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 But it's just a fish head that she's put in there.

927
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 Just a fish head.

928
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 And she must take it out.

929
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 I seem she doesn't leave it there.

930
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 Once she's got away with it once.

931
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 She doesn't have to.

932
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 She doesn't have to.

933
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 Have it for her whole life.

934
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 Just the thing on Moana, the movie itself.

935
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 Oh, yeah.

936
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 So if that scene, the vagina crushing scene was in the movie, obviously it would have been an ex-rated movie.

937
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 Right.

938
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 But in Italy, they actually had to change the name of Moana altogether because in Italy,

939
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 there was a very famous porn star called Moana, Moana Posi.

940
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 And parents were worried and they were worried in the studio that people googling Moana

941
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 to see cinema times and so would come across Moana Posi instead of the actual cinema.

942
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 So it was renamed to be Oceana.

943
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 So in Italy, it was released as Oceana to stop the ex-rated references coming out.

944
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 But she's, of course, to be a very disgusting club in Kingston, Oceana.

945
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 Which is why it couldn't be called Oceana in the UK.

946
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 Exactly.

947
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 They had to change it back.

948
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 They did really good research on Moana into Pacific Islanders culture and history and stuff,

949
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 didn't they?

950
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 And they consulted lots of experts.

951
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 So I think they're creators of the film travelled to Polynesia multiple times and they put together

952
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 a committee of linguists and anthropologists and historians from all over the Pacific Islands,

953
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 who I think ended up being called the something committee, the Pacific Committee or something.

954
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 Oh no, they were called the oceanic trust.

955
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 And they did things like, for instance, Maui for the first year of when they were coming up with the film was bald.

956
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 So if you remember the film, he's got all this curly, big curly head of hair.

957
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 Yeah.

958
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 And that's because he was bald and they went to the Pacific Island anthropologist who said

959
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 that's incredibly offensive because the hair is where your mana is, is where your power is.

960
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 And he's very powerful.

961
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 You've got to give him more hair.

962
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 So they gave him more and more hair until they don't just stop.

963
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 So he was meant to be quite a skinny character as well.

964
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 Maui in the mythology is a skinny character, but they made him quite large.

965
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 But do we know why that was?

966
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Why would they go against that?

967
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 So that was controversial, but that was actually at the advice of the oceanic trust committee.

968
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 So he's a very strong character and people said this is playing into stereotypes of obesity.

969
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 But the committee said, look, he's just incredibly powerful, imposing figure.

970
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 And also it's much funnier if you've got this huge thing.

971
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 And he's not fat in the film.

972
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 And I would say he is big-boned and strong.

973
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 Mighty.

974
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 Mighty.

975
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 Exactly.

976
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 Mighty Maui.

977
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 Do you know what are the main imports of the Pacific Islands?

978
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 This is now a general Polynesia effect.

979
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Imports.

980
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 Yeah.

981
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 Spam.

982
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 Oh, it's so close.

983
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 Oh, I think.

984
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 I thought it was, yeah.

985
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 Yeah, all right.

986
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 Well, maybe another one.

987
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 Oh, damn.

988
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 Okay.

989
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 Okay, but another food stuff.

990
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 So it's a food stuff that Americans, not Eels, is a food stuff that Americans, under USA, eat a lot of.

991
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 And it's a bit of it that Americans never eat.

992
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 Hmm.

993
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 But it gets messy.

994
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 Oh, is it the toy in a happy meal?

995
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 It's the toy in a happy meal.

996
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 Wow.

997
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 There's a huge part.

998
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 And it's controversial because they've got a lot of plastic in them.

999
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 You know, they'll get eaten a lot in the Pacific.

1000
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 No.

1001
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 Oh, it's not.

1002
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 No, that's a great guest.

1003
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 Sorry.

1004
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 I didn't really connect the other day and I didn't get anything right.

1005
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 And I know you guys kicked ass on it.

1006
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 So I thought James had just pulled out another stunner there.

1007
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 So it's turkey tails.

1008
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 Oh, yeah.

1009
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 So I didn't know about this.

1010
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 But in America, each year, there are 250 million turkeys eaten.

1011
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 And turkeys all have this tail, which is this weird oily gland at the very base.

1012
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 And it's basically the gland that keeps the feathers in of the tail.

1013
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 And it's got this fatty chunk of meat at it and it's never used.

1014
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 And America, it also gets called the Parsons nose.

1015
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 It's a great name for it.

1016
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 But it's not sent to shops.

1017
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 It just never gets eaten in the USA.

1018
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 So they all get sent to the Pacific Islands.

1019
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 And they started basically, America started basically dumping these there.

1020
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 And now it's a massive part of the diet.

1021
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 In 2007, the average Samoan was eating 44 pounds of turkey tails a year,

1022
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 which is three times as much as the average American eats turkey in a total.

1023
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 I think they think is a real problem, don't they?

1024
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 Because they do have an obesity problem in some of their islands.

1025
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 And it's because there's so much fat in these turkey tails.

1026
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 Basically, yeah.

1027
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 They really want to stop importing quite so much, I think.

1028
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 They eat a lot of mutton flaps, too.

1029
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 Did they?

1030
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 That's the thing that New Zealand exports, which is a very fatty bit of the cheap, basically.

1031
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 And they don't have teeth on them anymore, do they?

1032
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 [laughter]

1033
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 Oh dear.

1034
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 So another Disney film, which wasn't exactly true to life,

1035
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 was Pocahontas.

1036
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 And in Pocahontas, the male protagonist is John Smith, I understand, having not seen it.

1037
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 But all these things, I don't think are in the film.

1038
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 So he was a pirate's turn mercenary who fought the Turks in the Balkans.

1039
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 He was captured and sold into slavery.

1040
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 And was a slave for ages and ages before he beat his boss to death in a wheat field and escaped to Russia.

1041
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 And then because he was so famous as having escaped as a slave, he was invited to help establish the colony in America

1042
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 where he was arrested for mutiny on his way.

1043
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 And then eventually he did get to America and then he did meet Pocahontas, I believe.

1044
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 But then had to return to England to recover from a gunpowder incident, which blew his genitals off.

1045
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 Ooh.

1046
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 So he's got no genitals throughout the whole movie.

1047
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 No, this is not in the movie all this time.

1048
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 No, no, but like underneath the clothes.

1049
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 Again, I must stress, this is not in the movie.

1050
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 No, no, no, surely it must be the pre genital.

1051
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 Yeah, this is when he's sent back to England after all the stuff is happening in America.

1052
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 But if he couldn't make it with Pocahontas when he had genitals, it's not like he would have stood a chance when he didn't.

1053
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 I guess that's why.

1054
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 These are according to his memoirs, he said all this.

1055
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 And historians do assume that they were a total fiction.

1056
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 Oh. However, one historian, Philip Barber, has said that nothing that he's written has yet been found to be a lie.

1057
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 So it could be true, it could be not true.

1058
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 Okay.

1059
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 The story of Cinderella is a bit more terrifying than the one that we know from Disney.

1060
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 I kind of love Disney because they took all the Grimm's fairy tales that are grotesque and made them really child-friendly.

1061
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 But in the original Cinderella, the evil stepsist is when they want to fit into the shoes just resort to cutting off bits of their feet.

1062
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 So I think one of them cuts off her own toes and one of them cuts off her own heel.

1063
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 And they're caught apparently because of the blood dripping from the shoes.

1064
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 Although I would have thought it would be quite obvious if you put your foot into a shoe that you've either got no toes or no heel.

1065
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 You would have thought he noticed anyway.

1066
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 Well, if you just get someone to turn up wearing the shoe, I guess you might not.

1067
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 It depends on whether the prince is trying to witness the whole shoe fitting process.

1068
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 I think what happens is that the prince walks around with a shoe and he tries to put it directly onto people's feet, doesn't he?

1069
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 He like kneels down and they give them his feet.

1070
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 I guess I know.

1071
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 They give them their feet.

1072
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 I see what you're saying because if they went into a dressing room and then quickly chopped off the toes of the merge.

1073
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 If the hungry sisters took the shoe and said, "I'm sure I will be able to fit into this, just give me one second."

1074
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 And they pop into the kitchen.

1075
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 Oh!

1076
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 Just pick the socks to go with it.

1077
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 I think I'll pick the red ones.

1078
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 Yeah, the grim version, they also had, they stopped the sisters coming to the wedding by having pigeons peck out their eyes.

1079
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 What?

1080
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 It was a lot more.

1081
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 Why are they not allowed to come to the wedding?

1082
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 The battle is lost at that point for the sisters.

1083
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 They're still screaming an agony from the toe thing, they've ruined the vibe.

1084
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 Just don't sit in an invitation to the sisters.

1085
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 How about that?

1086
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 Invite them to the evening, baby.

1087
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 But we all know the thing with the wedding is you can only have a certain number of guests.

1088
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 And at one stage you have to draw the light and everyone else gets the right peck out.

1089
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 Okay, that's it.

1090
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 That's all of our facts.

1091
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 Thank you so much for listening.

 No such thing as a fish.com.

1101
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 We have everything up there from all of our previous episodes to links to buying our books.

1102
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 And there's also our behind the scenes documentary Behind the Gills.

1103
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 Check that out.

1104
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 Okay, we'll be back again next week with another episode.

1105
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 We'll see you then.

1106
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 Goodbye.

1107
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 Do you know how the eels feed themselves on the 3000 mile journey back to the Sargasso Sea?

1108
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 They keep themselves going by consuming their own bones.

1109
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 So their spine loses 65% of its volume and the skull loses 50% of its volume.

1110
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 And they break down these bone cells called osteocytes.

1111
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 And they use them to get the minerals and the nutrients they need.

1112
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 Okay, because they do, yeah, they lose all their teeth in their stomach and their digestive system.

1113
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 So I suppose they just have to defile their bones.

1114
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 That would be like, if we were born as adults and ended as a baby.

1115
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 A baby isn't an adult without bones.

1116
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 And you've got a child.

1117
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 No, no, but I'm talking to you.

1118
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 They have, they have more bones than adults.

1119
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 So it's not like that.

1120
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 I mean, born as a baby and ending as an adult.

1121
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 It's good to know which way rounds.

1122
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 That is.
