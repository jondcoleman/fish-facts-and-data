 *sangman plays in the background*

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.680
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.600
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.900
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Chazinski and

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.700
 James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.280
 favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go. Starting

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.760
 with you, James.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.480
 Okay, my fight this week is that the Mulan Rouge had a can-can dancer who would distract

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.400
 patrons by kicking off their hats before promptly downing their drinks.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.760
 It's such a good trick, it's a dangerous trick, because you might just kick someone

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.160
 in the face and then- I was thinking of the alcohol poisoning, but yes, these were problems.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.200
 But actually the kicking in the face thing, that was one thing that the can-can dancers

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.920
 would do is deliberately pretend that they were going to kick someone in the face. If they

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.440
 were taking too many liberties on the front row, they would kind of do a kick that got

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.640
 quite close to their face, and so that was the thing they did. And that's for the alcohol

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.240
 poisoning, unfortunately this lady called Lat Gulu, otherwise known as Louise Weber, unfortunately

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.700
 she did in the end succumb to the drink.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.080
 So this fact came to me from text, text message, when we were on tour last week, and it came

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.760
 from someone called Sarah Fung who I texted this morning, and she's allowed me to use it.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.040
 She's just as well, because you guys had already researched it.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.120
 But this lady called Lat Gulu, she was amazing, she was the highest paid entertainer of her

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.280
 day, and she was basically the Mulan Rouge personified.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.720
 She was the La Gulu means the Glotten, and yeah, she used to down, people's drinks, or swipe

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.080
 their chicken drumsticks from them apparently, and drumsticks at the Mulan Rouge.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.400
 It's surprising, isn't it? It feels like more Fernando's kind of survive, but apparently

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.360
 they were very sexy in the olden days. So she had various other methods of distraction.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.800
 She had a parrot, a pet parrot, a little pet goat that she kept on a lead.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800
 In the Mulan Rouge?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.320
 In the Mulan Rouge, well I think often you are sort of wandering around, maybe you're

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.520
 going to parties, how does having a parrot help you steal food?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.320
 Well, if anyone's distracted, yeah, it's just this whole woman's career, it sounds like

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.120
 an excuse to get more food.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.280
 Yeah, she was the Glotten.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.680
 Do you know what? She had a lover whose name was Lamon Frommage, the cheesy girl.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.360
 That was the name of her own friend.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.200
 That's like a preview of the cheeky girls, very much more French, cheesy girls.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.960
 That's my bum, no effects. Although actually La Goulou, so to interrupt Andy, but La Goulou,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.640
 one other thing that she used to do to distract people is she would bend over, show her knickers

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.840
 and she would have a big red heart on her knickers, and that was like one of her kind of

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.840
 signature move.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.840
 Yeah, exactly.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.280
 We've all got one.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.760
 People had amazing names, and another of the dancers was nicknamed Greedegou, which means

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.520
 "suagrating". Oh, nice. So it was Certric. I don't know. Do you know why she was called

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.520
 that?

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.520
 No, I don't.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.520
 It was like a teeth.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.480
 Yeah, she had really gaps in her teeth, that was cool.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.240
 This is great. This is like WWF. They've all got a character, a signature move.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.560
 It's all real, as well. It's all real.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.560
 Yeah.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.760
 There was another one called "Nini Le Pat" on there, which means "Nini Legs Aloft".

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.760
 Legs in the hernini.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.920
 It feels like that described all of them.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.240
 Yes, it does, apart from the "Nini" bit.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.240
 It was basically their thing, was throwing their legs up as high in the air as they could,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.240
 wasn't it?

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.240
 The French can can.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.240
 Yeah.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.240
 Invented the Moulin Rouge.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.520
 So "Vaber" or "Weber"? I guess it looks like a German name, but she was French.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.160
 She had a dance partner, who was called Jacques Renardin, aka "Valentant La DesaussÃ©e",

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.720
 which means "the boneless".

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.520
 And he wasn't successful, sir.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.520
 Amazing.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.120
 Every time he threw his legs in the air, they just plopped all the time, like a jelly.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.120
 Well, no.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.600
 I think he was very flexible, which being boneless does make you.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.560
 And I don't think he was literally boneless, but he danced at the Moulin Rouge as well, but

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.080
 he never accepted a single cent for it.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.080
 This is...

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.080
 Oh, really?

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.080
 Yeah.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.080
 What was he independently wealthy?

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.080
 I just did it for fun.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.040
 No one knows about his background, and no, he wasn't independently wealthy.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.200
 He just loved dancing so much.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.200
 He just looked guilty.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.200
 Who's that?

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.200
 Who's that?

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.440
 It's being a boneless people.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.920
 Have you guys ever had a Captain Frodo?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.920
 No.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.920
 Some larger rings.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.920
 A Captain Frodo.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.920
 Slightly different.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.920
 I think he's...

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.800
 Oh, he's from Summer in Scandinavia, but this is a modern cabaret performer.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.880
 He performs in a show called "La Clique", which is really amazing.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.080
 And his trick is that he can fit his entire body through a tennis racket.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.080
 Oh, I have time.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.080
 I've seen that.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.480
 In fact, he's got two tennis rackets.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.040
 One is ten inches, you know, from the base of the head to the top of the head.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.520
 And the other one is eight inches from the base to the top, and he gets through both

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.520
 of them at the same time.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.520
 Does the other one...

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.520
 Does he like dislocate?

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.520
 His shoulders are some...

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.520
 Very much so.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520
 He dislocates everything in his body.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.520
 It's incredible.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.520
 Yeah.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.520
 And they do take the strings off, don't they?

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.520
 (LAUGHTER)

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.520
 Yeah, they do.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.200
 I was just thinking of one more boneless thing, and there was an Ivan the boneless.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.200
 Wasn't there in the...

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.200
 In the sagas, I think.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.200
 Mm-hmm.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.040
 My favourite cartoon character in all existence is boneless chicken from Caron Chicken.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.440
 I'm so glad we're finally talking about boneless things after five and a half years.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.440
 Why is he called boneless?

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.440
 He has no boneless.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.440
 He has no boneless.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.440
 And his whole character is just...

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.920
 He turns up in about one and every six episodes.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.880
 And he's just like a flop-lump of skin, literally over a chair, a table all along the floor.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.600
 And they're like, "Oh, hey, Uncle Boneless chicken's come to stay again."

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.600
 "Hey, Uncle."

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.920
 And then he's just like, "Ahh."

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.920
 (LAUGHTER)

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.640
 So another performer at the Mulan Rouge is someone who's an old friend of the podcast.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.160
 We've spoken about him a few times.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.160
 What?

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.160
 Everard Diggby.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160
 Not Everard Diggby.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.160
 I say you're old Fred.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.160
 We've mentioned him probably twice.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.160
 Um, Le Patamaine.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.160
 Oh.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.160
 The French fighter.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.160
 He was a headline act at the Mulan Rouge.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.160
 Well, see.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.160
 You don't have to go on stage after him, do you?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.160
 Yeah.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.160
 That's what you'd go up.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.160
 And I don't know how it worked if we've mic'd, because I picture the Mulan Rouge, as you say,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.920
 like people are walking around with goats, you know?

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.920
 How are you going to hear?

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.920
 (LAUGHTER)

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.920
 How are you going to hear?

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.920
 But he did do stage stuff, didn't he?

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.920
 He did do stage stuff, yeah.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.600
 But I suppose usually he'd be in a quiet auditorium.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.600
 I see a point where, as you know, a lot is mingling, noise.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.600
 It must have been mic'd up.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.200
 It's not that sexy, is it, given that the Mulan Rouge was supposed to be a little bit

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.200
 raunchy.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.520
 I don't know if fasting is sexy, but it might have been back then.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.520
 Some people are france.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.520
 (LAUGHTER)

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.520
 Do you know one sexy thing they did have, they had a massive wooden elephant in their garden?

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.520
 And so that's in the film, because there was a recent film about it.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.520
 But I did.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.520
 Do you mean the film in the Mulan Rouge?

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.520
 Yeah.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.520
 Well, did they come out last year?

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.520
 90.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.520
 It must have been last year.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.520
 It can't be more than last year.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.520
 A couple of years, I think.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.520
 Okay.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.400
 I think I'm going to live between the invention of film and now, it's in the most recent

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.400
 myth, I would say.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.400
 (LAUGHTER)

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.400
 So it's a recent film.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.400
 Just.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.400
 It's just in the fifth.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.560
 This is completely irrelevant.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.120
 The point is, I don't know if they mentioned this in the recent film.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.480
 But it had a room in its belly for intimate dancers.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.480
 Did it?

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.440
 So you would have belly dancers for sort of an exclusively male clientele in there.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.440
 Belly belly dancers.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.440
 Yes.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.440
 Exactly.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.440
 So cool.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.440
 It's a bit sexy in the main club.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.880
 You'd say, hey, you want to take this to the elephant?

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.880
 Sure.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.880
 Should I bring the goat?

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.880
 (LAUGHTER)

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.280
 Do you know how old you have to be to go to the Mulan Rouge?

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.280
 What today?

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.280
 Yeah.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.280
 I would guess 18.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.280
 Younger.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.280
 Wow.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.280
 14.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.280
 Younger.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.280
 No.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.280
 Minus age.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.280
 No.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.280
 Six years old.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.280
 (LAUGHTER)

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.520
 Children from the age of six are now permitted to attend the uncensored evening shows, according

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.520
 to their website.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.520
 Wow.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.760
 But even in the 1950s, they had a children's matinee every Sunday.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.760
 What?

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.560
 So in the afternoon on Sunday, all the kids could go there and watch it, but all their dancers

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.280
 were much more covered up.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.800
 So they got the idea of being at the Mulan Rouge, but without the sexiness.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.800
 So the elephant was closed off for the afternoon?

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.800
 (LAUGHTER)

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.800
 There's no elephant in the room.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.400
 That's a shame, because a massive wooden elephant would be the thing I, as a sexier

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.960
 old, would want to see, rather than a load of dancing girls at the edge of sex.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.960
 I agree.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.560
 Something else they had in the garden that was very good for children, if they'd attended,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.040
 was donkey rides.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.040
 So not a thing you usually see in nightclubs anymore.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.040
 (LAUGHTER)

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.040
 I don't know.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.040
 The last time I went, which was quite recent.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.040
 (LAUGHTER)

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.840
 You got there in a horse and cart, didn't you?

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.280
 Yeah, they used to do donkey rides around the garden.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.820
 It was a pleasure garden, which someone described at the time as a pleasure garden with small

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.800
 enclosures for dalliances.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.600
 And the girls used to be allowed on the donkeys so they could sort of hitch up their skirts

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.200
 and show off their legs.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.200
 It was very exciting seeing people's legs at this time, so it was starting the 1880s, didn't

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200
 it?

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.200
 I'm still excited.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.200
 Sorry Andy, no, we're looking at each other.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.200
 It's still exciting to see legs.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.200
 Okay.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.200
 So again, we're a very old-fashioned group here.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.200
 (LAUGHTER)

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200
 You were established.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200
 I was mean to say something.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.200
 You were showing your ankles this morning.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.200
 (LAUGHTER)

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.200
 I've mentioned it to HR.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200
 (LAUGHTER)

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.200
 I thought pedal pushers were acceptable these days.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.440
 No, it was, because you hadn't really seen women's legs.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.840
 They used to wear big skirts that went down to the ground, or at least you'd only just see

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.840
 a bit of ankle.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.880
 And suddenly, they're doing the can-can, which is exposing their upper thighs.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.720
 And yeah, it became the main attraction, really.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.980
 And police used to go and check they were wearing underwear, so they'd come to the Moulin Rouge

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.280
 to watch, well, I bet they were gagging for that job all of a sudden.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.720
 I was going to say that is better than office work, isn't it?

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.720
 As a policeman.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.720
 It's a, yeah, it's a good gig.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.720
 That's a pretty good gig.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.720
 That's a pretty good gig.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.720
 No, they did tend to wear underwear.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.080
 They would have said you're nicked if they had to carry out arrests.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.080
 Yeah, yeah.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.080
 Very good.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.480
 The Moulin Rouge has quite a few Guinness World Records.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.480
 Okay.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.480
 Yeah, specifically for can-can.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:08.240
 So they have the most circular French can-can-kicks, they did 29 in 30 seconds, so they did this outside

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.240
 of the Moulin Rouge.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.240
 Circular can-c.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.240
 I think.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.240
 So it's...

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.640
 I imagine it's when you go, you kick your leg out to the left, and it goes all the way

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.640
 around, and I'm like...

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.640
 A bit like a roundhouse kick.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.640
 Yeah, exactly.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.640
 Oh, okay.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.640
 Yeah.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.920
 You're waving, but with your leg.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.920
 Hmm.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.920
 Yeah.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.680
 So they're in another record that they have.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.080
 There's a can-can soloist.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.360
 He's a Greek guy, and he's got the record for most high kicking behind his head, which he

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.400
 did 30 times in 30 seconds.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.800
 Now, I don't know if that means the kick goes...

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.520
 No, I would say it goes for...

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.840
 So, Dan was just pushing back with his arm, but I would say that it goes in the normal

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.640
 can-can fashion, but maybe the foot ends up behind your ear.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.640
 Behind your ear.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.640
 Yeah.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.640
 So 30 times in 30 seconds.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.720
 He could kick off his own hat.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.880
 The can-can was for men and women, originally.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.200
 It was a men and women's dance, and it was the men did all the high kicks.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.680
 The women didn't do any.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.680
 And then...

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.480
 And the really shocking thing about it was that there was lots of bodily contact between

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.960
 the partners doing it.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.600
 And then the women started joining in the high kicks, and people noticed that, oh, this

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.720
 is really sexy, partly because women wore open-croached pantalettes in the 19th century.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.000
 Not just partly, mainly.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.360
 I would say that's why it's sexy.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.360
 That's mainly what...

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.360
 Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.600
 So, they then thought, oh, this is much better than watching a load of men just leaping

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.640
 around all the corners of the stage, and that's how it got its salacious reputation.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.640
 Did they really...

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.160
 So, when they did the can-can at certain points, they must have had underwear under that,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.160
 right?

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.680
 They weren't flashing their vaginas in the mid-19th century.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.680
 I think they were.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.680
 I think they were.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.680
 Yeah, I think they were.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680
 They were.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.680
 Yeah, I think they were.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.680
 I think they were.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.680
 In the, like, not in the mill on Rouge, but, I think, in the...

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.680
 In a realm on March, in, like, other...

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.680
 I see.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.360
 In the sort of, the spin off...

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.040
 Yeah, they definitely weren't in the mill on Rouge, the mill on Rouge was very strict

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.040
 about pants, actually.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.040
 Was it?

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.040
 Yeah, yeah, it was.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.040
 They were very strict on that.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.680
 But, okay, there was spin-off to CDA places.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.840
 Because I think if they were never doing that, there'd be no point having the police there.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.360
 The police would have been just basically checking people's knickers for no reason whatsoever.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.360
 I know, you mean...

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.360
 Yeah, yeah, you're right.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.360
 There must have been a couple of people who maybe forgot.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.360
 Really?

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.360
 Maybe forgot.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.360
 Yeah, we all forget about pants some days.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.360
 We all do.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.480
 It really makes the police sound, like, creepy gym teachers checking everyone's wearing

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.800
 the regulation under pants.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.560
 Oh, you had a rough time at school, didn't you, Andy?

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.560
 No.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.560
 That's a sad cry, isn't it?

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.400
 Memories are flooding in there.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.400
 They've lost it.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.400
 I don't know what you're talking about.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.040
 So, I read about one accident in the mill on Rouge that happened.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.200
 This was in 1899, and there was a British newspaper.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.280
 I was looking at this up actually in the British newspaper archive, and the tone with which British

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.680
 newspapers report on it is so funny, because they basically, they're not outraged by it.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.400
 They don't think it's salacious and gross.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.400
 They basically go, "Oh, this isn't nearly as fun as our music calls."

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.520
 All the articles say, "I went there, and it was just massively overly hyped, and it wasn't

00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.520
 a big deal at all.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.720
 Didn't fancy anyone prefer to go to an opera."

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.280
 But anyway, all these articles are like that.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.880
 And then there was one report that in 1899, a mill on Rouge dance actually died while

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.480
 dancing her quadril, which was like the precursor to the cancan, because the dance ends with

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.360
 her jumping really, really high in the air, spree in the air, and then landing flat on the

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.360
 ground in the splits with her legs at right angles to each other.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.360
 Oh, no.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.520
 But apparently she did it so carelessly as to be injured fatally.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.520
 Wait, what does that mean?

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.520
 I don't know.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.520
 It doesn't mean.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.520
 It sounds like you'd be torn apart.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.520
 What?

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.520
 Is she like them?

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.520
 Yeah.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.520
 Doesn't mean she had a ceiling fan in the air.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.520
 I don't think they exist.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.520
 It's like that, isn't it?

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.360
 Oh, ceiling fans have been around for a long time, don't they?

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.120
 Well, you get those punkers in India, don't you, which are the sort of big mats you hang

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.120
 up, and then you sit in them.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.000
 It'd be hard to kill yourself against one of them.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.920
 Also, the only guy who goes to the mill on Rouge is looking at the ceiling fans.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.000
 It was the first place with electricity though, in France, wasn't it?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.960
 Well, they needed it to operate the ceiling fans, thank you.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.160
 They're probably a little doy ceiling fans, the main attraction, actually.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.640
 We've got to invent something that could make these ceiling fans work.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:13.000
 Just on scandalous dances, and the British press's reaction, so the Waltz was an earlier scandalous

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.920
 precursor to the cancan.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.560
 It arrived in London at about 1790, but even 25 years later, it was still pretty shocking,

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.920
 again, because you were very close to your partner.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.480
 An article in The Times wrote, "So long as this obscene display was confined to prostitutes

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.960
 and adulteresses, we did not think it deserving of notice.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.400
 But now that it has attempted to be forced on the respectable classes of society, we feel

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.640
 it is duty to warn every parent against exposing his daughter to so fatal a contagion."

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.640
 That was the Waltz.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.640
 Wow.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.640
 Yeah.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.640
 I still feel that way about novels.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.640
 It's a novel.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.640
 You say novels.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.640
 Novels.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.640
 Novels.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.640
 Novels.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.640
 Novels.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.640
 Novels.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.640
 Novels.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.360
 I thought it was some dance I had heard of.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.720
 Everyone's doing the novels.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720
 Novels.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:03.040
 Just feel like something that you might do in Bolton, in the dance halls of Bolton, everyone

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.040
 do the novel.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.120
 Because it does not feel like a Mulan Rouge kind of dance.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:13.880
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.480
 And that is Andy.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:20.760
 My fact is that in 1959, as a publicity stunt, a three-ton block of ice was driven from

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.200
 the Arctic Circle to the equator.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.680
 This is the craziest story.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.680
 Yeah.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.680
 It's insane.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.680
 So this was, I found this in an article on amusingplanet.com, which has brilliant articles

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.920
 about all sorts of stuff on it.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.800
 And this was in the 1950s.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.120
 It was a stunt by a Norwegian firm, which was trying to show how good their insulating

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.200
 glass wool was.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.160
 I didn't know about glass wool before, yeah.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.200
 But it was in response to a challenge on Radio Luxembourg.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.520
 In 1958, they challenged anyone.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.960
 They said, if you can take three tons of ice from the Arctic to the equator and it's verified,

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.560
 we will give you 100,000 francs for every single kilo that remains when you get to the

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.560
 equator.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.560
 Wow.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.680
 But the trick was you weren't allowed to use any refrigeration.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.280
 But you were allowed to use glass wool.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.640
 You were allowed to use glass wool.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.920
 And that prize was big.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.000
 That was the equivalent of $17,000 in modern money per kilo.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.240
 This is a big opportunity.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.240
 And how much did they get to the end?

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:21.200
 Well, by the time it got to the end, it had lost 11% only of its weight.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.000
 So do we know how much they got?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 How many kilos is left?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 They got nothing.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 It must have been about 2,700 kilos left.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 Yeah.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.280
 It was a 3,050 kilo block that this firm did.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:37.560
 And they must have got about the modern day equivalent of $2 million or something.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:42.960
 Radio Luxembourg had retracted the offer when it paying clear how much money they were going

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.960
 to lose.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.480
 Before they said offer, they retracted the offer very early.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.240
 But the manager of the glass that was so excited because they just wrapped up the block

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.240
 of ice.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.240
 And they took loads of medicines with them.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.160
 So it wasn't a completely pointless trip and they just put this massive block of ice

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.160
 on a truck.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.520
 Ice to the Sahara is not pointless anyway, right, it's you, at least useful.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.520
 That's true.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.440
 Although did they then distribute it around the Sahara for cocktails and stuff?

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.440
 They did.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.440
 Yeah, they did.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.160
 They chopped it up into little blocks and they gave it to people who in the article says

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.080
 had never seen ice before, really, ice blocks, you know, for people.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.400
 Although there was one thing where there was a documentary made about it and there were

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.760
 pictures of camels drinking this fresh Norwegian water as if it was the greatest thing

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.760
 in the world.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.120
 Actually, everything that they were drinking was full of glass wool and tar paper.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.560
 So it was really potable at all.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.160
 Do you know what happened to some of the ice?

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.360
 Some of the ice was flown back to Oslo.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.360
 Really?

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.360
 Yeah.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.160
 It was wrapped in presumably a smaller amount of glass wool and it was flown back to be given

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.040
 to journalists in their drinks at the media reception in Oslo, all about this incredible

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.040
 achievement.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.040
 That's really cool, isn't it?

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.040
 Yeah.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.240
 To have a gin and tonic where the ice has been all the way to Africa and back.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.240
 Yeah.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.240
 It's incredible.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.240
 It's just to buy things that have flown halfway around the world.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.240
 It has the fifties as well.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:02.040
 Oh, there wasn't anything actually, so they had an all-right drive down to North Africa,

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.400
 you know, and by the time they got to North Africa, they'd only lost four litres of water

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.640
 out of 3,000 kilos on this block.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.400
 I mean, this glass wool stuff is really good.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.640
 But Algeria was in the middle of a civil war, so bad time for driving through.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.240
 There were no roads through the desert.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.200
 And they had to keep on getting out and digging it out, just digging the truck out of

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.640
 the sand drift that it got into.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.560
 And the worst thing was, they had a very limited water supply, so they were really first

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.080
 to do all the time they were driving at this point.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.080
 But they not just lick the blouse.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.080
 Three tons of ice.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.080
 Wow.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.720
 So disciplined, though, that they all refrained from looking in the ice.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.640
 They wouldn't even take a milliliter off it.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.640
 Great.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.640
 Yeah.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.440
 Didn't they have to be guarded by the French for a legion at one point?

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.400
 I think going through the Sahara Desert, they were guarded because of the guerrilla forces

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.520
 in the Sahara that they thought might attack them.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.440
 Yes, I think Algeria was then in the process of stopping being French and starting to

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440
 be Algerian.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.960
 So I think that's why the French foreign leader might have been there.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:04.520
 What a lovely way of putting that very traumatic decolonisation of a country-period.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:09.760
 We're in this gradual transition phase.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.720
 And they did, as you say, they did take medicines with them.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.920
 So they ended up in gobbon at the end, and they brought a shed load of medicines and tons

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.160
 and tons of medicines to deliver to the people.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.880
 They're not just a pierced ant.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.880
 Although predominantly.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.880
 Most pierced.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:29.640
 But actually, the idea of bringing ice from the north or the south and using it in warmer

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.640
 climbs is quite a common idea through history, right?

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.640
 I guess so.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.360
 It's one of your favourite things, Andy, about lasso-ing icebergs.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.680
 This isn't for drinking it, but isn't it like when there's oil rigs or something?

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.920
 Yes, it's to stop it hitting oil rigs.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:52.920
 I actually found up one of the iceberg lasso-ing men and interviewed him about it, or he was running

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.960
 a company which does the satellite monitoring of icebergs because when I was drifting towards

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.320
 an oil rig and if it crashes into an oil rig, that's big, big trouble.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.440
 And so they just have to go out and they put a rope all the way around it and they tow it

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.040
 a little bit just for an hour or two, and then that pushes it into a different enough

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.720
 direction that it's going to miss the rig.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.720
 So cool.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.720
 It's amazing.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.960
 They don't fully tow it to the equator, which would be a big job.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.240
 But that has been a thing that people have tried to do in history and actually people have

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.240
 done that.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.440
 They've taken it from Antarctica up to places like Peru and where they used it for the

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.440
 brewing industry and when they have droughts.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.120
 Yeah, we had to get the ice.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.880
 And you know they used, you mentioned oil platforms.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.800
 Russia actually uses ice as a drilling platform.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:42.120
 So this is this really cool kind of ice, which is a giant ice block called Nalleds, which

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.440
 are basically ice blocks that form on rivers.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.600
 So ice that forms on rivers can be much thicker than ice that forms on lakes because if it's

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.600
 cold enough, then the fourth of the water underneath the layer of ice pushes up in the

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.200
 slightly warmer day time through it and runs on top of it and then it freezes overnight.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.440
 So you've got like a second layer and then the next day at the same thing happens again,

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.400
 you've got a third layer where it's like a Russian doll.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.960
 It's like a Russian doll made of ice.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.240
 So you can get these huge like seven meter thick blocks of ice and they've been used for

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.320
 things like the North Korean military.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.080
 I know we don't like to take tips from them, but the North Korean military used them to

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.320
 build river crossings for their tanks in winter and Russia has drilling platforms made

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.320
 of these giant ice blocks.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.720
 Sorry, do they move or can you move them around?

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.720
 Can you turn them into place?

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720
 They pick them up.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.760
 Yeah, so they take them out of the thing.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.760
 Yeah, it's amazing because there was a plan to use them in Mongolia.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.520
 This is where I found out about them first.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:40.040
 In 2011, a plan for keeping Mongolia cool in summer.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.560
 So I thought Mongolia may not have a problem with being too cold, but Ulaanbatore gets

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:49.240
 very hot in summer and so they said to regulate temperatures, reduce air con and provide drinking

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.760
 water and irrigation.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:55.600
 They would take some of these huge blocks of ice and dump them in Ulaanbatore and gradually

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.360
 let them melt through the summer and it was what they called an ice shield.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.040
 And this would sort them out and it was this plan.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.720
 They got like hundreds of thousands of dollars of funding and if anyone knows what the hell

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.240
 happened to it, can you let me know?

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.240
 I must have counted, I know.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.720
 Sorry, that is amazing.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.960
 So do you know whether it actually happened?

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.280
 I have no idea.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.000
 It kept on saying they've got the funding.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 They're doing this.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 The plan's underway.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 2011.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 Zilch from here on in.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 Oh, weird.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.520
 So on publicity stunts, Game of Thrones announced the premiere of their seventh season with

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.240
 a block of ice.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.040
 What they did was they set up a large block of ice and then in front of it they put a camera

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:39.200
 and they set up a Facebook live broadcast with the block of ice melting and if you typed

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:44.440
 fire, I think this is how it worked, a little flame thrown near it would blast a small amount

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.440
 of fire.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.600
 And as the big block of ice melted, it was going to reveal the date of the launch of the

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.600
 series.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.600
 It's clever.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.880
 Unfortunately, it took a long time.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.840
 It took over an hour and everyone was typing fire and everyone was getting really frustrated.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.560
 Fans are, ice is really hard to melt, even if you even if you type dracaris, which is

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.720
 a thing from the show and it means that multiple flames are as fired.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.760
 It still took more than an hour and then the live stream broke.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.720
 So they were just left with a big block of ice and eventually Game of Thrones just tweeted

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.160
 the date that the series was coming up.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:22.120
 I can't believe Game of Thrones fans above anyone else couldn't be bothered to sit around

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.280
 for one hour and wait for that.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.800
 Well, there was no nudity in that hour, so I don't think, yeah.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.760
 It should have been like one of those mugs that when it gets hot, shows a naked woman.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.400
 It should have been two shagging vikings that gradually appeared.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.400
 Have you ever seen it?

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.120
 You've got a very good grasp of what was showing us.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.600
 Thanks very much.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.040
 I was looking up ice stunts as well.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:52.240
 Did you guys ever hear about the 2001 sort of ice contest launched by a Birmingham radio

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:58.920
 station, which it was on, and he's looking horrified enough that he definitely knows about this.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.160
 It was BRMB radio station and basically it got this cool idea from a New Zealand website

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:08.640
 which had run a similar competition and this site said that they'd, you got a block of ice

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.400
 of ordinary ice and they'd had a contest to see how long contestants could sit on it and

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.480
 the winner got the prize.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.560
 So this Birmingham radio station decided to do the same thing, but due to what was reported

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:27.040
 as a breakdown in communications, they had people sit on a lump of dry ice, which, of course,

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:33.240
 minus 78 degrees Celsius, it ended up, it was to win tickets to go and see Jerry Halleywell

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.280
 and A1, which they ended up going, didn't they?

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.560
 That's the worst thing I've ever had.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.840
 No, it landed three contestants in hospital for more than two months with severe frostbite.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.400
 They got permanent scarring, three of them had to have skin grafts and stuff.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.960
 And yes, severe burns.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.120
 The one who escaped with less serious burns only escaped with less serious burns because

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.400
 she was wearing 14 pairs of pants.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.400
 Wow.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:02.280
 It's sort of the opposite of the Moulin Rouge before that.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.760
 It's a really bad story.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.760
 That is bad.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:09.560
 And the thing is there was a St John's ambulance team watching and they said, you know, you really

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.960
 shouldn't sit there for longer than 10 minutes.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.960
 That would be dangerous.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.960
 And they were there for nearly an hour.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.960
 Still 10 minutes is too long.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.960
 Try it out, please.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.960
 It's minus.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.960
 It's insane.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:22.840
 How did one person not read like minus 78 degrees and say, this feels weird?

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:28.320
 Well, eventually there was a massive legal case over it and the radio station was fined

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.320
 15,000 pounds.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.320
 Yeah, pathetic.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.320
 Three people permanent scarring for life.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.320
 Wow.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.320
 Insane.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.800
 But they got to go to the concert.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.800
 Well, that's good.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.800
 Yeah.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.840
 And hopefully, although apparently it really hurt to sit down.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.760
 So you'd hope I suppose that they had a mosh pit.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.240
 Well, you wouldn't be sitting down to Jerry Hallowell and A1 gig.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.680
 You'd be on your feet the whole time.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:53.280
 Oh, you'd be being passed over the wave thing that people do in the audience with their

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.280
 arms in the air.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.280
 Okay, guys.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.280
 Enough.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.280
 Enough.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.280
 You know, the mosh pit.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.280
 Yeah.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.280
 What's it?

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.280
 No, that's not what it's called.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.280
 Yeah, you'd be, um, you'd be cross, I think.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.280
 There you go.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.280
 There you go.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.280
 Wow.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.280
 Do you remember David Blaine's ice thing?

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.280
 Not really.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.040
 Oh, this is before he went up over the river Tim's, yeah.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.880
 He spent 58 hours inside a block of ice in the year 2000.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.880
 Oh, that's right.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.880
 Yes.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.880
 He really hard.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.880
 Yeah, he did.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.120
 Yeah, he was sealed in to two blocks of ice with a body-shaped cocoon in the middle.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.120
 Right.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.280
 And he had a, he had a tube to breathe through.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.280
 And he could drink water.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.520
 I mean, he could drink water whenever he liked, I guess.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.200
 But this was good mostly because of all the other magicians immediately giving him

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.720
 shit over it and being furious.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.240
 So Penn, half of Penn and Taylor said, pumping hot air into a phone booth and putting ice

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:48.080
 around it and standing around without a thought in your head isn't a trick.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.520
 And a spokesman for David Copperfield said, a spokesman for David Copperfield said, if you

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.240
 look at the physics of it, it's warmer than a downfilled sleeping bag in there.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.240
 Wow.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.240
 They were really loving it.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.240
 Yeah.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.240
 And they don't know he didn't have a thought in his head.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.400
 He could have been creating the next Shakespeare.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.400
 Yeah.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.400
 Or his next trick.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.520
 Like, I'm going to sit in a box next time.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.520
 Exactly.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.560
 You know, come up with that kind of genius I don't know where.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.720
 All good if he did lick the size and then your tongue got stuck to it.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.720
 Yeah.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.520
 Just how long was he there?

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.520
 58 hours.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.520
 58 hours.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:26.920
 Just tongue stuck to the wall, everyone watching.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.360
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.400
 And that is Chizinski.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:39.000
 My fact this week is that prehistoric babies drank from animal shaped sippy cups.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.640
 And this is a recent discovery they've been doing some archaeology or checking out some

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.160
 sort of graves that were dug up a while back.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:51.360
 And there are two, some Iron Age graves in Germany and a Bronze Age grave nearby.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.400
 And they both turned up in children's graves in like little toddlers and babies graves.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.720
 These vessels and they had spouts basically.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.400
 And they've looked at the proteins that are in them.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.600
 And it showed that they contained some kind of milk, either goat's milk or cow's milk

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.120
 or something like that.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.280
 And it's really interesting because we didn't know that women weren't just breastfeeding

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.480
 their children exclusively at that age.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.560
 And it turns out that they were obviously using cow's milk and stuff.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.760
 But they think it might be the cause of a big baby boom.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:25.480
 So the first baby boomers were prehistoric and they happened basically because people stopped

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.800
 having to breastfeed their children for so long and so much because they maybe had these

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.320
 sippy cups and they shared child care a bit more because they'd settled down into

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.960
 the group communities.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.600
 And so when they weren't breastfeeding, they then menstruated a lot more and got pregnant

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.600
 a lot more.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.840
 Had loads more kids.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:41.840
 It's all about the cups.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.000
 So it's a good news story.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.480
 It's a great news story.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.480
 It's a great story.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.480
 Yeah.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.440
 And just to clarify, in the fact, similar vessels have been found that are shaped like animals

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.440
 in the same region.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.640
 So we now know that these animal shaped cups were used for babies.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.640
 Yeah.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.640
 Which makes sense.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.640
 What do I be right in saying?

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.280
 It's not just a good news story.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.040
 It's a sort of seminal human existence story, right?

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:07.600
 This is this is a big moment in how there was a big boom of life that came off the back

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:13.480
 of it where suddenly we were farming humans, basically, not so as what you mean by that

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:18.800
 is we were humans who found we were farming humans or that we were humans who were farming

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.800
 humans.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.440
 Farmers that were human farming humans is what I mean because, yeah, because suddenly

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.920
 you could you could have way more humans than you were capable of, which is one pair

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.920
 of breath.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.920
 But I definitely went too far.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.920
 Yeah.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.920
 I've got a side.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.920
 It was out there.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.920
 I couldn't have got a cannibalism implication, I think.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:36.920
 What do you do?

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.920
 I'm a human farmer.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:44.880
 But, yeah, collective parenting was a thing, you know, it's like you had crashes, basically.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.560
 And I think that it makes sense that you would have had crashes because they were presumably

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.880
 going out into the fields to work.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.640
 And so you could leave one person to babysit the kids while everyone else went out to work.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.640
 Which, yeah, we didn't know.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.880
 It's quite cool how they detected the milk in the vessels as well.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.760
 Because it was essentially because they had these cups, but they weren't glazed.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.080
 And so it means they've got like tiny tiny little indentations in the surface that you

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.400
 couldn't possibly see.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:11.840
 But they happened to be the perfect size, these little pores to fit fat molecules, lipid

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.840
 molecules.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.320
 And so they've just filled in these little indentations.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.320
 Wow.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.800
 So we can just get them out and go, ah, it's a milk.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.800
 That's amazing.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.440
 The amount of technology you need to be able to do that compared to the amount of technology

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.960
 you have to have a cup.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.960
 Yeah.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960
 Yeah.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.960
 It's just so weird, isn't it?

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.960
 Yeah.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.640
 They're better than those people.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:36.200
 No, I don't think so, really, because those kind of technologies finding tiny bits of lipids

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.200
 is not going to cause a massive baby boomers.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.200
 You never know.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.400
 I just don't feel like it.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.400
 Maybe everyone will hear this.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.400
 Go home and shag tonight.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.400
 No, right.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.400
 It was a sexy fact.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:50.680
 But yeah, animal shaped cups have been a thing throughout history, actually, for adults

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.680
 and children.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:56.360
 There was a Harvard Museum exhibit last year, which took them from all over the world.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.080
 It was like rounds and balls and lions.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.920
 And they came from ancient Greece and they came from Persia.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.960
 And yeah, they would have, like in Greece, they would have a donkey shaped cup, which I think

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.480
 had the spout at the back end, so that it was the shape of a donkey's head, sorry, spout

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.480
 at the back end.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.160
 So when you drank from the spout, it looked like you were wearing a donkey mask on your face.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.160
 Oh!

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.160
 That's cool.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.160
 Really clever.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.160
 I remember.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:25.320
 They used to have human head shaped cups, as in they were actually made from human heads.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.240
 That was a thing.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.320
 Yeah, quite around the world, people have drunk out of human skulls.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.200
 But the oldest ones we have are from Somerset in England.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.200
 Oh!

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.760
 Yeah, we were the origins of drinking out of human skulls.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.760
 Oh.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.760
 Wow.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.760
 Something to be proud of.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:45.120
 That's why my human farming knowledge has gone wrong.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.120
 Lord Byron had one of those.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.120
 Did he?

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.120
 Yeah, he was very proud of his skull cup.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.120
 Yeah.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.120
 I think it was set in gold.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.240
 I think it was just the top of a skull, you know, it was the main bit.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.240
 And then he had a proper handle on it, a base.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.200
 Yeah, because you couldn't get the face in, because then it's full of holes, isn't it?

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.200
 It's going to come out the eye.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.200
 Yeah.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.200
 Yeah.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.640
 Because I can only think of it as skull as being more like a saucer than anything else, I

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.640
 suppose.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.840
 Yeah, but if you think about old cups, like, what do they have, what do they have on

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.960
 grease, curries, or what it would call, they're more like sauces, aren't they?

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.960
 Yeah.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:15.960
 That's true.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.960
 And you do have a very flat head, actually.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:17.960
 And I can see.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.440
 Well, it's more of a dinner plate.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.440
 Yeah.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:27.280
 There were, on Greek cups and receptacles and things like that, there were mixing balls

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:35.080
 called crafters, craters, craters, and the Greek poet, Eubulus, wrote that after three craters

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.960
 of wine, all the sensible guests go home and he was describing what happens next.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.800
 This is in a, I think, in a national geographical level.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.280
 With our parties, it's after three crates of wine.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:49.120
 Well, he said that the fifth crater leads to yelling, the sixth to prancing about, and

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.760
 the seventh to black eyes.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:56.000
 The eighth brings the police, the ninth vomiting, the tenth insanity, and hurling the furniture.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.880
 That's really good.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.520
 I reckon that's a slightly different order to how we do it now.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.520
 It's essentially the same, but we've just slightly evolved to tweak it.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:10.280
 I think vomiting actually comes before black eyes now, and I think police comes less.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.280
 Yeah, exactly.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:15.360
 Unless they've gone involved, because there's at least two more sessions there, because,

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.520
 you know, you wouldn't get the police just for yelling or for prancing about.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:22.720
 Maybe from black eyes, but insanity and hurling the furniture is a definite public order

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.720
 of fence.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.720
 You're right.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.880
 And as you say, once the police have come, the party's shut down.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.880
 It's weird.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.880
 So, in fact, under what circumstances do the police come, and then leave, and then the

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.880
 furniture hurling happens?

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.880
 Yeah, sure.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.640
 Terrible police forces.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.640
 In the Persian Empire, they had, like, cool, fun-shaped cups.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.480
 And if you threw a banquet, if they came through a banquet or something, then everyone

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.480
 would get a different animal-shaped cup, and you took it home at the end of the night.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.480
 Like a party back.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.480
 That's really awesome.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.480
 You're good, isn't it?

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.480
 Yeah.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.480
 But quite it's quite an expensive habit.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.560
 Did you say it was the king of Persia doing it?

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:58.520
 Yeah, so he could have fallen for all of it, too, yeah?

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.560
 I've got some stuff on children looking after children and feeding children.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.120
 Yeah, I do, too, yeah.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:10.560
 And so, the first infant formula, like a powdered food for babies, was invented by a guy

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.280
 called Justice von Liebig in 1865.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:19.560
 And he is also the man who basically invented oxal cubes and mermaids.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.560
 Wow.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.560
 Isn't that cool?

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.080
 He's amazing to see babies.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.920
 Oh, so these are two separate processes that he came up with, but he came up with loads

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:27.920
 of processes.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.920
 Yeah.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.640
 So, one of them was getting cow's milk wheat, malt flour, and potassium bicarbonate, and

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:37.560
 then mixed them together so it became, like, a powder with milk in it.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.520
 And then the other thing was a way of getting beef extracts out of beef.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:45.440
 And so you could get, you could squeeze this beef so much that it was a really concentrated

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.440
 bit of beef.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.280
 And then that became basically bavaro and that oxal cubes.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:54.080
 And this guy, no one's heard of him, but he's done so many, like, but sorry, is that so mermaids

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:57.840
 just sort of, like, someone's taking a stake and they've squeezed out like a sponge?

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.400
 No, mermaids more use space, but it's the same process.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.400
 Yeah.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.400
 Cool.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.400
 So you take some use, didn't you squeeze it?

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.400
 Yeah.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.400
 Yeah, bring it out.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.200
 But was, what, I thought was the baby food that was beef related?

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:16.160
 I think babies did get given, that was, that I think called, was it pap or panada?

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.840
 Oh, pap is like bread and milk, isn't it?

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.600
 I think it's just bread and milk mixed or something.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.000
 I think it covers a few different things.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.720
 So you could be milk and flour or melted butter.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.880
 And then sometimes children would just fed her kind of meaty broth.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.640
 I think no one really knew what came after milk for a long time.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.040
 I think you just experimented with it differently.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.040
 Yeah.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.040
 Like meaty broth.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.040
 Yeah.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.200
 It must be nourishing because it's meat, you know?

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.200
 Yeah.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:45.000
 I was reading that in the 1700s in Paris, not many people actually breastfed their own children.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.040
 They, it was a big thing of outsourcing wet, no, for wet nurses.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.840
 So there was a survey that was conducted by the police chief of Paris in 1780, another creepy

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.840
 police.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.840
 Yeah.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:01.680
 He'd been promoted from looking at Nickers to look at their boots.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:08.080
 The survey revealed that of the 21,000 children that were born annually in the city, 17,000

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.760
 were sent to the countryside to a wet nurse.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.760
 Wow.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.760
 There's a huge amount.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.760
 And then there was a condition that if you were sending your kid to a wet nurse and you

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:20.160
 had the money, you would pay them to exclusively breastfeed and look after your kid.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.160
 Yeah.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.160
 But these wet nurses had kids.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.120
 So they had to outsource their kids to poor people out in the country.

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.120
 Yeah.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:30.520
 So there was a, there was a lower rung of wet nurses who were the sort of more, you know,

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.520
 for the poverty stricken.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.520
 Yeah.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.520
 So kids were just being pushed further and further into the country of France.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.520
 I was like on a boot.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.520
 It was.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.520
 So I had no idea.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.520
 It was so widespread.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.520
 Yeah.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.120
 That 90% of people were not breastfed by their own mother.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:49.000
 And also you have this image of wet nurses as being for a rich family and, you know, you pay

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 for the wet nurse.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.960
 But largely, especially when people started industrialising, it was for poor families and it

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.200
 was for people going and working in factories.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.640
 And then, you know, you know, nothing you could do with your kid.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.640
 It's a rough gig though.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.640
 They were very looked down on the wet nurses.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.640
 Well, they.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.640
 Yeah.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.640
 Because women were a real job.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.640
 They're doing an important job.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.640
 It's a really important job.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:14.400
 And if you've insisted that you latch your own baby on another woman's tit, then teet,

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.400
 teet.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.400
 Well, either.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.400
 Ten tees.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.400
 Ten of them.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.400
 Yeah.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.400
 The least you can do is show some gratitude.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.400
 I think you're absolutely right.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.400
 Thank you.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.560
 So I was looking at weaning and breastfeeding and things like that.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:30.720
 I didn't know that, um, and there was a big study of this in the 1950s by a scientist

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.920
 called Ian Wicks.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.160
 And he found that Renaissance Europeans had fed their infants with a cow's horn with a leather

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.960
 nipple attached to it, which is a pretty cool way of being fed.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.960
 Yeah.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:41.960
 Yeah.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.400
 I mean, I think also in Europe around that time, they were going directly from the cow,

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.400
 weren't they?

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.240
 Like, you would just attach a child to a cow or a goat or something.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.240
 Yeah, a really goat.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.240
 Wow.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.240
 They used to have goats and orphanages.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:58.160
 So the Mulan Rouge might have had the goat out during the matinee performance for kids.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:06.920
 The goat would just go around the audience as like a shot girl.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.800
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.160
 And that is my fact.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:16.840
 My fact this week is that the reason movies include that all person's fictitious disclaimer

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:22.880
 at the front is because one of Rasputin's assassins successfully sued MGM for not accurately

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.240
 depicting the events of Rasputin's murder.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.240
 What?

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.240
 Yeah.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.240
 I mean, that is...

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:34.000
 What's amazing about this fact, I think, is Rasputin feels to me or felt to me like about

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 500 years ago.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Yeah.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.080
 And movies like Mulan Rouge was so recent, they feel like a modern day thing, but they're connected.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.080
 They're connected.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:47.080
 It feels insane that such a historical event is, yeah, it has...

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.080
 So when was the...

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.920
 Was the Rasputin died in what, 19...

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.920
 16...

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.920
 16?

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.920
 I believe it was 1916.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.920
 Okay.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:54.920
 The movie came out in 1933.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.920
 That's a relatively early movie.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.920
 It's an oldie.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.920
 It's an oldie.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:38:59.920
 It's in the first 20%.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.920
 Isn't it?

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:01.920
 Yeah.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.920
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.920
 Yeah.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.920
 It wasn't the first 20%.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.920
 No.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.920
 No.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.920
 No.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.920
 I'd say it's the second 20%.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.920
 But I think within the first half.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.920
 Oh, certainly the first half.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.920
 The first half, oh, yeah.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.920
 Depending on when you're listening to this podcast actually.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.920
 If you're...

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.920
 Sorry, Dan.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:23.600
 So, Prince Felix Yusupov, he was a Russian aristocrat and he was one of the people who

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.560
 helped to kill Rasputin.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.400
 He didn't get that much trouble other than to be exiled from the country.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.400
 So it was while he was exiled and he was living with his wife.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:37.760
 That this movie came out, which was based on a few biographies and so on, called Rasputin

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.360
 and the Empress.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:45.040
 So in it, they name him differently, but it's clearly him who they are depicting.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.280
 And he wanted to sue them because he thought, oh, you're depicting me really badly.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.280
 Obviously he couldn't.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.280
 He was an assassin.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.160
 He was a guy who killed the lead character in the movie.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:58.320
 So what he had to do was sue them via his wife because in the movie, they create a scene,

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:04.240
 deliberately falsified where Yusupov's wife is raped by Rasputin after being hypnotized

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.040
 and that never happened in real life.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.760
 So she ends up suing them for a lot of money.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:13.960
 They lose the case and MGM is part of the court case and part of losing it generally.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:18.400
 They have to put this in the front of movies, which all other movie houses do as well,

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.960
 to avoid being sued by real life characters in movies.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.960
 It's astonishing.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.960
 Yeah.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.920
 You know, this country, the BBC documentary, it's not a documentary, it's kind of a pseudo-documentary

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:32.960
 comedy about these, this brother and sister couple who live in this really rubbish bit of

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.720
 the country and their lives are horrible and have a grim time.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:39.320
 Anyway, they forgot to rename their teacher.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:44.880
 So they gave the character in this same name as their teacher and now everyone chouts at

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.240
 the teacher in school and it's apparently ruined his life.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.240
 Yeah, I'm not surprised.

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:52.200
 And she recently apologized from an award ceremony saying, yeah, sorry, but yeah, ruined

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.200
 his life.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.200
 Whoops.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.200
 Sorry, not that.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.200
 Sorry, check out my trophy.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.200
 That basically was.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.800
 They used to have that thing called the small penis defense.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.800
 Do you remember that?

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:06.480
 The idea is you put someone in your book and you make it so it's obviously them, but you

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:10.840
 say this character has a small penis and then when you go to court, you could say, well,

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:16.920
 it's obviously not this person because my character has a very small penis.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:21.160
 It doesn't feel like a crowbar in certain novels when, you know, when it popped up in Pride

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.640
 and Pregidance made way through.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.640
 I was extremely surprised.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.200
 This is a Harry Potter.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.240
 Tiny wand.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:31.400
 Well, one person who didn't have a very small penis was Russ Futon.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.400
 Very nice.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.680
 Well, allegedly, he didn't have a very small penis.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.680
 Yeah.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.480
 Well, some people said he did about one doctor's report from 1912 or 13 said he had completely

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.520
 shriveled testicles.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.520
 Really?

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.520
 That's completely different.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:46.280
 That's literally a different ballgame.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.000
 I think you just assume if they've said shriveled testicles, perhaps you assume that the

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 other part is shriveled as well, but you're right.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 It didn't get better.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 You would have referenced that.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 You're right.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.280
 And perhaps the testicles just luck shriveled because it was so enormous.

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.080
 You're absolutely right.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.320
 The compliment in disguise.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.120
 His penis is in various different museums in Russia.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.360
 Apparently, Polina was telling me, my wife was telling me, yeah, there's lots of different

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.800
 like small towns with their own little museums and lots of different ones have his penis

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.800
 as well.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:13.800
 Oh, okay.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.120
 So he's basically things that arm his penis.

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.120
 Yeah.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:21.640
 It's so large that they were able to actually chop a healthy chunk out pretty, so I thought

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:22.640
 you meant.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.640
 Should we say who he was?

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.640
 That's beautiful.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.640
 Yeah.

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.640
 So he's a guy from that song.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.640
 Yeah.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.640
 That's right.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:33.640
 It's sort of monk believed to be a mystic who had this weird relationship with the last

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.640
 zars of Russia.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:40.640
 Zarnickles II and his wife and their son and could allegedly cure their son's hemophilia

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.200
 and was eventually off for, you know, this very dodgy influence.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.480
 He seemed to have over the whole court and over the zar.

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.480
 Yeah.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.440
 Also, he had had a phone call earlier that day, Rasputin with a death threat.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.760
 You don't think of Rasputin receiving phone calls, do you?

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.760
 He loved the telephone.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.760
 Did he?

00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.280
 I think of him with phone calls because that was famously how he used to cure the zaravitch.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.280
 Yeah.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.280
 But he loved phone calls.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.080
 He and his daughter used to make nuisance phone calls all the time, whereas she used

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:12.320
 to do dirty voices to the men who would answer the phone and whenever he ever was on

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.920
 the phone, he would always do squats, twels and stamps while he was on the phone.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.960
 He'd always dance around while he was on the phone.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.960
 Whoa.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.960
 That's great.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:20.960
 Isn't it?

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:24.000
 And just to add, because you just said earlier, the circumstances of his death, which

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.800
 have now been debunked, and you talked about the cyanide.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:34.000
 But just to give the full story of how he died, the story goes of the myth is that he

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.680
 was fed enough cyanide to kill them several times over.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.920
 He was beaten severely with clubs.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.200
 He was then shot.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.960
 He was then stabbed repeatedly.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.080
 He was then shot twice more.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.480
 But after that, when he should have been dead, he got up to strangle his attackers, and

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.360
 they eventually threw him in a river rolled up in a carpet.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.360
 Yeah.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.880
 And not only that when his body, and I think this was the case, when his body resurfaced

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:59.800
 a few days later, his lungs were filled with water, which showed that when he was landed

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.040
 in the river, he was still alive and breathing in the water.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:07.720
 I think it was the carpet that did it, and the, sorry, are we going to say what actually

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.720
 happened?

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:13.640
 Well, just the account of the poison aim, because this is all used to pass account as well.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.840
 So when he arrived, they gave him loads of cakes, which were poisoned with potassium cyanide.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.160
 It had no effect.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.320
 So then they gave him a glass of wine, laced with potassium cyanide.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.320
 That had no effect.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.280
 Then they gave him a second glass of wine, laced with potassium cyanide, and they said,

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.280
 are you feeling unwell?

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.280
 And he said, yes.

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.760
 My head is heavy, and I have a burning sensation in my stomach.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.760
 So they thought, great.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.760
 We're well on the way.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.760
 So they gave him a third glass of wine, laced with potassium cyanide, at which point

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.880
 he perked up and said, oh, thank you, I'm feeling much better off with that glass of wine.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.440
 Then the police were called, then the black eyes.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:47.360
 At this point, they've run out of potassium cyanide, and they're really wondering what to

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.360
 do next.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.480
 But there are all these theories about why the poison didn't work.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.560
 One is that they just had old poison.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:58.720
 One is that he was given sugar, like it was cakes and wine, given to him, and that binds

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:02.600
 with the act of ingredient, which makes it much less poisonous.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.360
 And then there's another theory that used to be made up all of this, and actually they

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.360
 shot him in through him in the room.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.200
 I think that's the one that we kind of think about, because there was a confession by one

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.280
 of the conspirators later on who said that we didn't poison him at all.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.280
 Yeah.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.280
 Just shot him.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:21.440
 But it fed the myth, didn't it, of this crazy, invulnerable monk who was sinister and has

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.800
 some weird malign influence over the Zah.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:28.200
 And sort of really sordid, and it's really difficult reading about Rasputin now because

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.680
 we know that he was such a victim of propaganda at this time, so all the first-hand accounts

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:37.560
 about how sex-crazy he was as a weird nymphomaniac guy.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.560
 We don't know.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:43.040
 I mean, I think there's a new biography that Francis Welch wrote, I think.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:48.120
 But even then, I think, at the time, there was such a hardcore propaganda drive against

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.120
 Rasputin.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.040
 Should we not just go with the rumours, though, because it's going to be funny?

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:57.000
 Should we not just say that the reason the women of St. Petersburg loved having sex with

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.240
 him so much is he had enormous water, his penis, but he had sex with them.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.520
 They got an immediate orgasm.

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.960
 Should we not say that kind of thing?

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:04.960
 We can't say it.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:05.960
 We can't say it.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.960
 I'm going to kill everything you said.

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.800
 Actually, James, have you actually seen this what yourself?

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:15.120
 Look, you can have, like, various things are not true.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.320
 He did not get out his willy in a restaurant and wavered around to prove that he was Rasputin.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.320
 We haven't.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.320
 We think that did not happen.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.680
 I've never heard that one, actually.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.680
 So this was where...

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.680
 This was in 1915.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.160
 This was shortly before he died, you know.

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.600
 He was under observation by the police and he goes to a restaurant with a group of followers

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:34.920
 and starts bragging about his relationship with the Zahs wife and implying that he's slept

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.560
 with the Zahs wife and someone asks him, "Are you really Rasputin?"

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:43.800
 He replies by getting his penis out, saying, "This is what Rasputin does, therefore I must

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.800
 be Rasputin."

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:49.400
 But it's a bad proof because it's him saying, "Look, if I wasn't Rasputin, would I really

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.200
 be getting my knob out in a restaurant?"

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.800
 Who is the president we spoke about that did that as well?

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.080
 Lyndon Johnson, let's get his penis out of there.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.080
 Yeah, over time.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.280
 But he did it in response to journalists, didn't he?

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.280
 Yeah, I think so.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:03.600
 It's not a good way of proving it because it's such an easy trick to imitate.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.600
 That's true.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.800
 Maybe you've got to have the big penis to do it.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.800
 And the massive what?

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:08.800
 Yeah.

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:12.040
 It's so hard to tell from the other side of the restaurant.

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.800
 Equally hard to enjoy your meal afterwards.

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.720
 Can you imagine Lyndon Johnson on the Andrew Mah Show on a Sunday morning?

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.520
 Well, I'll tell you, that's much Andrew.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:24.320
 Anyway, he didn't do that.

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.320
 He didn't do that.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.320
 He didn't do that.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.320
 He was a myth about the restaurant.

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:31.280
 There were all these rumors about his genitals, and people kept on wanting to pull them off.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:36.240
 I think maybe the two are related, though I don't know, but there was a monk called Iliador

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:41.160
 who, first of all, he claimed that he'd got 120 bombs, that he was going to use to kill

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.160
 Rasputin.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.000
 And then, by some course of events, he apparently lost these bombs and ended up chasing

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.320
 after him with an axe and telling him he was going to castrate him.

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.880
 I don't know what happened with the 120 there.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:54.760
 There was another holy man who was called Blessed Mitya who ended up punching Rasputin

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:59.080
 in the face, and then trying to pull off his testicles manually.

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:03.560
 There was a bishop called Hermagan, who grabbed Rasputin's penis, screamed that he was the

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.680
 Antichrist and proceeded to beat him with a huge crucifix.

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:12.120
 Do you know who almost got the gig before Rasputin?

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.440
 Which, what do you mean the gig?

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.960
 So, the gig was basically the Countess Sire, she wasâ¦

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:17.960
 A spiritual advisor.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.560
 Yes, spiritual advisor, she was very intoâ¦

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.880
 So, it must be someone we've heard of.

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.040
 It is definitely someone we've heard of.

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.040
 Lord Bernard Shaw.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.040
 No.

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.040
 It's a great guest.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.040
 Lovely guest.

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.040
 Of course.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.040
 No.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.040
 Lovely guest, but no.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.040
 Harry Houdini.

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.040
 Harry Houdini.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.040
 Wow.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.040
 Oh my god, what a guest.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.040
 That's an incredible guest.

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.040
 What?

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.040
 Yeah.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.720
 Harry Houdini was overdoing shows there, and they met up, and there's that famous thing

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:45.080
 of Arthur Conan Doyle not believing that Harry Houdini wasn't really magic.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.920
 Same thing with the Tsar and the Countess.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.320
 They thought he was genuinely doing magic tricks offered him in the world.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:55.320
 So, what an alternative universe, Harry Houdini is Rasputin, that's even right.

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:58.320
 He probably could have got out of the river, that's the terrible thing.

00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.320
 Yeah.

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.320
 A lot rolled me up in a carpet.

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.320
 No problem.

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.320
 That's insane.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:12.040
 Yeah, and he wasâ¦ I've read this in a Harry Houdini book, he was offered the role afterwards

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.040
 as well.

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:14.040
 So, we've lost our advisor.

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.120
 I don't know if you saw the papers, but we're looking for someone new.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.960
 And Houdini was asked once again, in turn around.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:24.320
 If you said no, the first time, I think that second time, if you had read the papers, it

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.960
 would be a pretty hard no.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:26.960
 Yeah, that's true.

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:32.440
 Do you know why they think Rasputin was so efficacious in curing Azaz Himophilia?

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.440
 Well, yeah.

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.880
 So, Himophilia is where your blood is very thin, and if you cut yourself accidentally, you

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:42.160
 don't stop bleeding for a very long time, so very, very dangerous.

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:48.720
 It's possible that Rasputin just said in his kind of holy mystic way, "Chuck

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.280
 away all the medicine you've been given.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.480
 I'm going to be looking after you."

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.720
 And it's possible that some of the medicine was aspirin.

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:54.720
 Oh, really?

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:55.720
 And aspirin, yeah.

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:56.720
 Thin to blood.

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:57.720
 Thin to blood.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:58.720
 As a side effect.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:05.880
 So, it may be that there was a grain of truth in Rasputin's advice, but not for the reason,

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.560
 obviously, that he was mystical.

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.560
 Just like that.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.560
 Yeah, it's cool.

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.520
 Also, there's a thought that maybe when he was hypnotising over the phone, and someone

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:17.080
 is in person, it has a relaxing effect, which it does, like meditating.

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.240
 And then if that lowers your blood pressure and lowers your heart rate, then you're going

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.240
 to bleed less.

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:23.720
 So, it helps dissipate it in that way.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:24.720
 Interesting, yeah.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.120
 But, you know, conventional medicine is probably advisable these days.

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.120
 Oh, use this.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.120
 Where?

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:34.160
 We were talking earlier about Maria Rasputin, his daughter in the phone calls.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:38.360
 So, after this happened, she moved away and became a lion tamer.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.360
 It was so close.

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.360
 She really?

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.360
 Yeah, she did.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.360
 That was one of her jobs.

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:50.120
 She was also a dancer in Paris, in the beginning of the 1900s, as well.

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.120
 Yeah.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:54.880
 Unfortunately, I've not seen if it was there, but yeah, so that's what she did for a living.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:55.880
 Made a minute.

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:56.880
 Rasputin.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.120
 Everyone said he smelled like a goat.

00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.120
 Yes.

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.120
 Didn't they?

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.120
 They did.

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.120
 That was one of his things.

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.120
 He never washed.

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.120
 He once didn't change his underwear for six months.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:05.120
 Yeah.

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.840
 Everyone who met him said he smelled like a goat, who was with La Goulou.

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:10.800
 So, you saying maybe she Maria Rasputin was the goat?

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.800
 No, I'm saying.

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.720
 And Rasputin, the elder, was disguised.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.240
 He was disguised as a goat.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.240
 So, live.

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.640
 They never pulled him out of the river at all.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:19.640
 Exactly.

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:22.000
 And that goat was just Rasputin in a carpet.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000
 Huge.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 It's such a fool from grace, isn't it?

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 It's not so nice.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.200
 He's hinting at entertaining the children at the Sunday matinee.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.200
 Yeah.

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.200
 Is anyone here?

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.200
 He's a failure.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.200
 Put it away.

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.400
 We believe who you are.

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:42.600
 OK, that's it.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.600
 That is all of our facts.
