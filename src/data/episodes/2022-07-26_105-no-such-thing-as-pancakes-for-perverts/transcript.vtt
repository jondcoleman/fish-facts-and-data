00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.840
 >> Hello, and welcome to another episode.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.600
 A no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.040
 This week coming to you live from Newport.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.600
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and please welcome to the stage.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.820
 It's Anich Zinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.780
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.780
 >> And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.380
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.780
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.780
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.860
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that Grumpy from the Seven Dwarfs

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.980
 is not nearly Grumpy enough.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.380
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.180
 >> Sounds like an opinion.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.260
 >> It is an opinion, I'd say.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.540
 It's the opinion of some researchers from Duke University

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.700
 and North Carolina.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.740
 And what they did is they looked in a load of movies

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.580
 that are aimed at children, so they would be rated you in the UK.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.980
 They split all the characters up in class.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.780
 So you have your opera class, your middle class, and your lower class.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.820
 And they decided that the depiction of working class was unrealistic,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.660
 and that the Seven Dwarfs would not be singing cheerfully

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.060
 as they walked down to the mind.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.620
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.340
 >> So James, who were the scientists?

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.420
 >> Yeah, they were just people at Duke University and North Carolina.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.780
 To be honest, they are their cartoons, aren't they?

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.900
 You don't really expect them to be all that kind of realistic.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.500
 But scientists don't like it when you get things wrong.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.700
 In the Lion King, they're hyenas in the Lion King and the bad guys.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.380
 And some of the artists for the film spent two days observing hyenas

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.180
 in the hills above the campus of where they were.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.460
 And the scientists who were with them said, look, hyenas are good guys.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.820
 Don't depict them as idiots, as evil people.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.660
 And they did.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.100
 And then one of them sued.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.140
 >> What are the hyenas?

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.940
 What are the hyenas?

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.940
 >> One of the hyenas.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.220
 >> I mean, that is litigious.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.700
 And I think they are evil as a result of that.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.980
 >> Well, that wouldn't be very realistic either, would it?

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.580
 >> Now, it was one of the scientists sued, yeah.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.180
 >> I wouldn't watch that film, though.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.300
 One of the hyenas from the original film, soos the mix.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.740
 >> This is the Lion King 3, which is like--

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.540
 so the Lion King's sort of based on Hamlet.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.060
 >> Yeah.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.420
 >> And then the Lion King 3 begins with Timon and Pumper,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.460
 the comedy characters, and they're based on

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.100
 Gildenstone and Rosencrantz in the original thing.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.980
 But then the Lion King 3 is based on Gildenstone and Rosencrantz

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.900
 and dead, the Tom Stopper play.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.940
 But then it begins with Timon and Pumper watching the Lion King 1

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.020
 in a cinema.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.540
 This is how the Lion King 3 begins.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.420
 And they say, that's not how it happened.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.260
 We're going to tell the story of how it actually happened.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.700
 And it's all the other bits.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.460
 So it's Gildenstone and Rosencrantz and Gildenstone and dead.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.020
 But from the perspective of a war talk of America, amazing.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.020
 >> So on the Seven Doves.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.580
 So originally they have no names.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.780
 In the Grim Brothers story, they have no names.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.900
 And then when Disney did the famous film in 1937,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.940
 they had about 50 potential names for the door switch

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.220
 were slowly whittled down.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.940
 And the rejected names included Jumpy, Defi, Hickey,

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.180
 Baldi, Puffy, Stuffy and Orphal.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.300
 >> I actually made a list of my dream Seven Doves.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.100
 >> Okay.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.420
 >> I think that these were all on the Disney potentials list as well.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.500
 There's Slotty, Hotsy and Chesty.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.540
 Which I think are obviously a bit of a threesome.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.100
 And then Orphal, Guppy, Snourful and Big O Ego.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.340
 I think that would be a bit of Seven Doves.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.500
 >> Chesty.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.500
 >> Chesty.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.500
 >> Chesty.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.420
 >> I actually read that when they pick Dopey as one of the characters

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.300
 that people working at Disney said to Walt Disney,

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.980
 that that's not a good name to use.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.900
 Because this is meant to be an old tale.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.340
 And Dopey is a relatively recent hip name.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.180
 And so people will think that that's not a good name.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.580
 >> Oh yeah, because like Dope just meant good, didn't it?

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.460
 >> Yeah, exactly.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.580
 And so Disney said, well, it's not a new name.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.820
 It was used in a Shakespeare play.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.820
 So they went, oh, okay, of course, sorry.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.660
 >> He made that up.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.260
 It was never, it was like, yeah, it's right here.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.460
 Dopey or not Dopey.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.260
 >> [LAUGH]

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.900
 >> I actually once lost a school quiz off the back of a question of name

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.500
 all the Seven Doves.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.220
 We got six of them, and we were stuck on the seventh.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.300
 And my friend, my best friend, Dan, suddenly went, oh my god,

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.460
 I know it because it's my dad's name.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.940
 So, what's his name?

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.700
 >> Sneezy.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.780
 >> His dad, his dad was a rock star in Australia.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.900
 Really a big rock star for Doc Neeson.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.860
 And he goes, I know it.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.420
 Now, Doc is not his dad's real name.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.500
 So what he ended up putting on the paper as the seventh dwarf was burnard.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.020
 >> [LAUGH]

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.940
 >> Are we looking at him?

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.660
 >> Are you sure?

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.540
 >> He's definitely grown up.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.100
 Everyone's like, oh, I like the dwarf.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.540
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.780
 >> So there's some controversy about this fact, because obviously as a study,

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.540
 some would say it is fatuous, the word has been used.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.100
 But I was around this table studying this kind of thing and drawing these conclusions.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.660
 So I was looking at other potentially fatuous studies.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.540
 And so there were two studies, one in 2008 and one in 2013 looking at how films can

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.020
 affect people psychologically.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.900
 And so whether you know we should be worried about the effect of Hollywood films,

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.700
 for instance, on society and ourselves.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.460
 2008, there was an Edinburgh University recruited a hundred volunteers.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.220
 And the study deduced that fans of romantic comedies have a stronger belief in pre-destin love.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.780
 And they have more unrealistic expectations for relationships.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.380
 So romantic comedies, bad, give us unrealistic expectations of relationships.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.380
 >> 2013, there was another study looking into exactly the same thing.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.860
 Found that there is no correlation between people who are interested in watching romantic comedies.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.540
 And people who have unrealistic ideas about love.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.660
 >> So really, you can make a study say whatever it is you want to prove.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.580
 They'd be good if the leads of those two papers got together and then had a beautiful relationship.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.820
 >> Yeah, that's a thing, I know that sometimes they do seem like they shouldn't have been done.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.220
 But I love the studies that make no sense.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.860
 Here's a great one I really like, this from 2005.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.580
 This is what the study was about.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.580
 Far away objects are tougher to see.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.620
 >> [LAUGH]

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.540
 >> And they confirm that to be true.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.780
 >> [LAUGH]

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.220
 >> Swallowing more than one magnet is dangerous.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.300
 >> [LAUGH]

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.020
 >> There is, I think it is a problem with kids because magnets are sold down as

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.460
 office stress relievers, I think.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.900
 And yeah, apparently, sure.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.500
 But if you swallow one it is bad.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.700
 But there are like hundreds of people who have met E.R.'s in America every year.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.420
 Kids who have swallowed two of them.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.860
 And obviously that really screws up your intestines because as soon as you swallow the second one,

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.540
 they try to find each other in your insides and disrupt everything else in the meantime.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.540
 So that is quite bad.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.220
 >> That is amazing.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.980
 >> We need to move on to our next fact, does anyone have anything before we do?

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:09.260
 >> I can give you one more study that's kind of a bit fatuous but also about Disney stuff.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.220
 So they did this thing where they had men watching movies.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.140
 And they had so much with sad movies and so much with happy movies.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.420
 And the happy movie was the jungle book, which would make everyone happy.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:24.020
 And so they made them watch this jungle book and then they took swabs from their armpits.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.340
 And then they gave the swabs to women and asked them to smell them and

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.300
 smell all the different armpits that people who've watched all the different movies.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.660
 And they found that people who'd watched happier movies when you smell their armpits, it makes you smile more.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.420
 >> What?

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.660
 >> I mean, you can't be smiling much because you're smelling an armpit.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.900
 >> Yeah, it could be more of a grimace.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:52.620
 >> Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.140
 >> My fact this week is that the ancient Romans had party bags.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:02.300
 >> So in ancient Rome, if you went to a dinner party at the end of it,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.300
 you would be given a thing called an apophoretor which literally means a take away.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.580
 So they invented takeaways as well.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:14.260
 And we know about them because there was a poet called Marshall and he wrote a whole book about them.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.380
 It's 221 pairs of lines and it's everything, the things that were given away.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:28.380
 So they included toothpaste, whips, seashells, bladder foots, or I think I translated this right, a pastry penis.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.740
 >> It does get that grexty.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:38.420
 >> That's true and he said, even if you consume every part of it, you will not be the less pure.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:45.900
 >> So you had this huge range of things you could be given at the end of the night.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.780
 It was very exciting.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:47.820
 >> Wow.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.820
 >> You could also take your food away at the end of the night after Roman parties, couldn't you?

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.940
 >> They had a doggy bag.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.180
 >> They had doggy bags.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.620
 They were the inventors of the doggy bag, which is unbelievably cool.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.780
 I think it was called a map.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.940
 You had to bring your own doggy bag sometimes, I think.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.540
 So it was called a mapai or a mapai, I guess, in the singular.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.340
 And it was a piece of cloth and you'd bring it.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.540
 And if you had leftovers, you wrap them up and you take them away with you.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.860
 >> Wow, that's really interesting.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:15.620
 I remember reading once that there were a lot of houses in Rome which were above shops.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.100
 And if you lived in one of these flats,

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.380
 they were quite low-roofed and they didn't want people like their shops to catch on fire.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.300
 So you weren't allowed to cook in them.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.380
 And so if you wanted to eat anything, you had to get everything take away.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:26.900
 >> Really?

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.780
 >> Yeah.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.020
 >> Wait, it's just a fact.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.780
 >> That's amazing.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.700
 >> Yeah, it's got that, isn't it?

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.140
 So you want to go to these parties all the time to bring your doggy bag home.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.020
 >> So what were the parties like back then?

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.140
 Were they wild?

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:38.980
 Were they raucous?

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.780
 >> I think they varied like parties today then.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.780
 >> All right.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.180
 >> The more I looked into it, they had hot tub parties.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.020
 >> I found out.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.380
 >> Which I didn't know about.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.580
 >> Did they have toga parties?

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.420
 >> They didn't wear togas most of the time, did they?

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.260
 >> Did they not?

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.340
 >> I think they wore tunics.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.980
 >> Yeah, I think they hated them, didn't they?

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.060
 They had to wear them every now and then, but they were really awkward to wear.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.740
 Was it not Roosevelt had a toga party?

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.380
 Because people took the Mickey out of him and said that he was acting like a Caesar.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.540
 And so his wife kind of threw a party, as if to say,

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.300
 like as if to cock a snooke to the man, I believe that.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.180
 >> He was the man.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.460
 >> What are you talking about?

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.500
 >> Right, yeah.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.500
 >> To the little man.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.500
 >> To the little man.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.180
 >> Yeah, Roman parties, it's good question.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.860
 One of the things that I've always thought would be, you've been awkward at Roman parties,

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.940
 is the fact that everyone had to lie down.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.260
 And so at dinner parties, everyone lay down, as we know, and you'd have a couch arrangement

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.820
 where there would be a couch or a bed on three walls of the room.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.980
 And you'd have the hosts on the middle couch.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.220
 And then the top guests, there were seating plans.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.220
 So I think they also came up with seating plans.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.300
 And the most favored guests would get the couch where you had the better view of the

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.020
 host, and you had a really nice view out of the building.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.980
 And then the less favored guest just got a view of the wall.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:53.460
 And you had to lie down and you lay on like your left arm and ate your food with your

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.460
 right arm.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.340
 It just sounds really uncomfortable.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:02.700
 >> So another thing that Roman's invented was the concept of deal or no deal.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.980
 In that, this is invented by the emperor Augustus.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:14.340
 He asked his guests to bid sums of money for pictures when they were faced to the wall.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.220
 So you had to bid a sum of money on a picture, which you couldn't see the value of it.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.060
 And I gather that that is what happens.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.380
 >> That is exactly the same.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:27.380
 >> So that is, and then they turn the painting round to reveal it at the end.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.380
 >> Yeah.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.380
 >> Cool.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.380
 >> That is amazing.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.380
 That is deal or no deal.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.380
 >> That is deal or no deal.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.380
 >> Wow.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.380
 >> He said, you also when you went to a dinner party with Augustus, you would pay for a token

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.660
 and it was inscribed with what you might get.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.340
 But they varied hugely.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.180
 So you couldn't really see what was on the token before you bought it.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.460
 So again, it was like a blind auction.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.820
 >> That is like a lucky dip.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.300
 >> Like a lucky dip.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.460
 And so you could either get some gold or you could get a sponge.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.460
 So it was really varied.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:01.300
 And then, a later emperor, Ella Gabelus, he gave out things called lucky chances, which

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.860
 were these special spoons and it was inscribed with what you'd want.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.860
 And it might say ten on it and you'd redeem it and they'd say, oh, you've won ten pounds

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.940
 of gold or it might be that you won ten flies or something.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.940
 So really varied.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.140
 And they started giving them out at the Coliseum and when they had a lottery at the games

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:21.220
 in the Coliseum, it was, you just won a token and you'd redeem it and see what you'd

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.220
 want.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.220
 >> Wow.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.220
 >> You might have won ten bears.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.220
 >> How terrifying to have the ten, yeah.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.020
 >> You'd wonder ten times I have sex with your wife.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.700
 >> It could be anything.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:36.120
 >> You shouldn't ever run the lottery.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.420
 >> We need to move on to our next fact and I want to go anything else.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:45.300
 >> I can quickly tell you that there's £808 million spent on party bags for children's

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.620
 parties in the UK every year.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.620
 >> Wow.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.620
 >> £808 million.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:55.100
 Apparently, the average bag is worth £7.50, which I think means there's £107 million

00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:02.300
 party bags, which means every child gets 30 each, so it goes to 30 parties every year.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.300
 >> Every year.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.300
 >> Yeah.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:11.540
 >> I didn't know 30 people had a certain, certainly not 30 would have had me talk to them.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:17.060
 >> And apparently 2% of a thousand parents serving in one survey said that their child had

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.140
 received an iPod in a party bag.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.140
 >> Wow.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.140
 >> Wow.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.620
 >> Even they serving people in Chelsea mansions.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:32.220
 I read a news article, an American news article, a mother called Sherry Jamison, who was

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:38.020
 left speechless when she had a birthday party for her son, her six-year-old son, and

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.460
 guests took back the birthday gifts they'd given him when they found out there were going

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.020
 to be no party bags.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:49.140
 The article reported about a party goer who asked to remain anonymous, saying a lot of us

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:53.060
 feel cheated, the kids had fun, but it was a really bare bones event.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:57.780
 It's not like she had a bouncy castle, and she's since received emails and texts from guests

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.260
 who felt it would be in poor taste to take their gift back at the party, but who are now

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.900
 getting in touch to demand to be refunded the full price, including tax of their present.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.900
 >> Including tax.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.500
 >> Let the tax go.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:15.460
 >> Let's move on to our next fact, so we don't run out of time.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.140
 So it's time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:24.900
 My fact this week is that Ernest Hemingway once stole a urinal from a bar, saying that he

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:32.180
 pissed away so much of his money into it that he owned it.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:36.860
 >> I can tell you from experience, that very rarely works on landlords.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:43.380
 >> Steve, this is on all your financials.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:48.940
 >> Yeah, so this was a bar that he used to go to all the time, and it was moving, it was

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.660
 closing down, and so he just went in, and he just took the urinal off, and he brought it

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.540
 back to his house.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.700
 And James, I know you've been to Ernest Hemingway's house.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.940
 >> I have been there, and the urinal is still there.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:01.940
 >> Really?

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.940
 >> Yeah, it's still there, you can see it.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.500
 And when you go to Ernest Hemingway's house in Key West, they make you go on a tour

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.460
 around there, and that's one of the things they tell you that this is the story.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.340
 Because urinal is now in the garden, I think, and it's right, it's in the back garden.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.660
 >> And it's been turned into a fountain, or it's a nice centerpiece.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.220
 >> I think it's quite a nice urinal, actually.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.420
 If my memory serves, it's quite big and made of big stone, and it's kind of got flowers

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.420
 on it and stuff.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.420
 I think it's quite nice.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.420
 >> Wow.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.420
 >> Hopefully.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.420
 >> How did he get it out of the bar?

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.620
 Because I wouldn't know where to begin taking your urinal off the wall.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.820
 >> He was a big, manly man there, and you know, you're-

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.820
 >> I understand.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.820
 >> He was enjoying your wine over there.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.900
 >> You've made yourself very plain.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.780
 >> He was a big guy though, you're right, he was obsessed with boxing.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:52.580
 He used to take on people half his age, saying, and probably, you know, same size as him,

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.700
 but assume being younger, they could take him out.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.700
 And he would-

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.700
 >> He had his own boxing ring in the back garden.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.540
 It was next to where the urinal now is.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.940
 And he went off to the Spanish Civil War to act as a correspondent.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.740
 While he was there, he had an affair with another woman.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:12.140
 And his wife wasn't very happy about that, so she sold his boxing ring and bought a swimming

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.540
 pool.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:18.180
 And that swimming pool cost $20,000 in those days, which now is hundreds and hundreds of

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.180
 thousands.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:23.260
 And when he came back, he had one penny in his pocket, and he said, you've taken everything

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.660
 I've got, have this last penny, and he threw it down, and it's still there under a bit

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.660
 of glass.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.660
 And you can see it if you visit.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:33.300
 >> A good, we preserve the remnants of his childish, spoiled brat tantrums.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.300
 [laughter]

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.700
 >> On his manliness, I love this image.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.940
 He wrote standing up, always.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.740
 He wrote, he would write in pencil.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:49.420
 He wouldn't be wearing a shirt, so he had a shirt off wore baggy shorts, and they were held

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:56.180
 up by a leather belt that he'd taken off the body of a dead German soldier that was inscribed

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.580
 with the German III Reich kind of insignia.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.580
 >> Wow.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.580
 >> That's cool, isn't it?

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:06.180
 >> A half naked man with a third Reich belt standing up and writing some novels.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.180
 >> I think we know your type.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.180
 [laughter]

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:14.860
 >> Just on the pub fights thing, I read that he went out drinking with James Joyce, and

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:20.460
 that James Joyce would get into fights, and then say, hemmingway, deal with this, because

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.740
 he was too drunk, that Joyce was too drunk to stand.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.220
 This is according to Hemmingway.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.820
 I have a fact about Ernest Hemmingway, which is that Hemmingway was part kangaroo.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:29.820
 [laughter]

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:34.900
 >> Have you got dozens notes there?

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.300
 >> No, he was.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.300
 He was part kangaroo.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.300
 >> Come on.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.380
 >> He broke his arm in a car accident, and the surgeon tending him bound his bone together

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.620
 inside his body with kangaroo tendon.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.620
 >> Wow.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:53.620
 >> Yeah, and this wasn't an innovation just for Hemmingway, at some point, a standard medical

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.660
 procedure to put a bit of kangaroo inside you.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.660
 >> That's so cool.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.780
 >> It feels like the tendons would be kind of stretchier, doesn't it, a bounceier.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:00.780
 >> Yeah.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:01.780
 >> I wonder if they would.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.780
 >> Maybe why they used it.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:03.780
 I mean, I don't know.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.780
 But anyway.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.020
 >> It's not like all bits of a kangaroo, a bounceier, James.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.020
 >> I don't know.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.020
 [laughter]

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.020
 >> The lovely rubber.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.900
 >> Do you know when he was a young boy, Ernest Hemmingway, when he was a young boy, his

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.660
 mother used to dress him up as a girl, because she didn't want a boy.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:20.020
 She wanted a girl, and so she used to dress him up as a girl, and call him Ernestine.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.020
 >> Oh.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.020
 >> Backfired very badly, didn't it?

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.020
 >> It really did.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:28.140
 >> But it was up until like he was six years old, he was going around.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:33.540
 She grew his hair long, and he had to pretend to be the twin sister of his older sister.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.540
 >> Wow.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.540
 >> Yeah.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.540
 >> They're pretty weird family.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.540
 >> I read he didn't like his name.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.380
 He didn't like being called Ernest, because it was like the hero of an importance of being

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.380
 Ernest by Oscar Wilde.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.380
 >> Oh, really?

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.860
 >> And he was upset about that, because that was why he objected, because he thought.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.380
 >> He thought Oscar Wilde was a feminist.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.340
 >> Oscar Wilde was a feminist, and therefore that he shouldn't be called Ernest.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:56.900
 >> He had huge problems about wanting to be incredibly masculine, a sort of hyper-masculine,

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.620
 and a really, seriously odd guy.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.820
 >> He was also, honestly, go home and spend two hours researching Ernest Hemingway, because

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.420
 you think, as I was saying to James yesterday, as you're really about him, you think, I have

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.580
 not lived.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.580
 This man has lived.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:15.700
 And in so many ways, one of the ways was that he was incredibly accident prone, it seems,

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.700
 so he had this old kangaroo malachina on.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:25.420
 He had a plane crash in 1954, so he was on safari with his wife, he was in Uganda, and his

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.300
 plane crash had to crash land, and they had to choose whether to crash land on an elephant

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.460
 trail or in a big crocodile pit.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:37.060
 >> So, these are the only options, and he was a tiny strip of land in between the elephant

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.060
 trail.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.060
 Look, look at how big.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.060
 What are we at?

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.380
 What do they pick?

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.220
 >> They pick the elephant trail.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.220
 >> Of course, yeah.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.620
 >> As they've had it in the elephant trail, then he, his wife and the pilot of the plane,

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.100
 had to sleep there overnight, because they were surrounded by elephants, blocked in by

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.100
 these elephants.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.100
 So, they were both quite badly injured, and the next day they were rescued by another plane,

00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:02.260
 so they boarded this other plane, which caught fire, and also crashed the following day.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.260
 >> Where did that crash into?

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:09.420
 >> Do you want to go to the snake pit on the Will the Beast to a sanctuary?

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.660
 >> I would pick the Will the Beast to a sanctuary.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:17.620
 >> Don't be calm, I've been looked after.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.860
 >> Maybe we can adopt one.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.580
 >> What if Earth comes after Will the Beast for that joke to make sense?

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.260
 >> What about the hyena land?

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.180
 >> What about that?

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.420
 >> Actually, hyena's quite nice guys.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.740
 >> I actually read a thing about Will the Beast the other day, that I was going to try to

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:43.180
 use for a vague fact, scientists were saying that they were looking ancient Will the Beast,

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:49.220
 and apparently ancient Will the Beasts, they evolved a trunk, like a longish trunk, so that

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.940
 they could gossip with each other.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:51.940
 >> Yeah.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.980
 >> Because they needed to tell each other, like just you'd Jeff over there, like they needed

00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:00.980
 to tiny little bits of gossip, and they couldn't do it with their normal Will the Beast

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:01.980
 face.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:02.980
 >> What?

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:07.060
 >> I feel like you're paraphrasing this, though.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.060
 >> What did it say?

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.060
 >> I'm gossiping.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.460
 >> Do you know where Hemingway's biggest scar came from, so he had this big scar on his

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.460
 forehead.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.460
 It was the most prominent thing he'd noticed about him in his life, and it didn't come from

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:21.020
 the car crash or from the two plane crashes or from the motorbike accident he had when he

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.020
 was in Germany.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.980
 >> Are the wass that he was kind of any of the wass he covered.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:28.420
 It came from a time he was in a bathroom, and he pulled the chain, thinking it was the

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:33.700
 toilet flush, and it accidentally brought the whole skylight down on his head, and that's

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.020
 what gave him this massive scar, and whenever anyone asked him about it, he was really

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.540
 reluctant to say, it's from a toilet skylight.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:45.220
 >> The two plane crashes, there was an interesting thing that actually happened in the time between

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.620
 the first plane crash and the second plane crash, which was he and his wife were reported dead,

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:55.420
 and it got spread around the world, and obituaries were printed the next day, and so he had the

00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:00.380
 rare thing of being able to genuinely see the obituaries to his life, and then the next

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:04.780
 day he got on a plane, and then that crashed again, and that led to severe trauma, which

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.980
 his best friends think is what led to the end of his life, for him killing himself from that

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.260
 second plane crash, I think it just ruined the rest of his life.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:16.420
 But again, you know you're saying just what an insane character, what a big life, he during

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:23.020
 World War II was hunting Nazis, despite not being enlisted into World War II, and he did

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:28.700
 it from his boat, and his boat was set up, it was a fishing boat, it had direction finding

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:34.620
 equipment, it had a machine gun, it had grenades, and he went out hunting Nazi U-boats.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:39.540
 He used to practice with his son trying to take down U-boats with grenades by throwing them

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.540
 at turtles.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:49.900
 I think that was very unfair on the turtles, A) you're implying their Nazis, and B) a U-boat

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.300
 is a lot tougher than a turtle, but that's what he did, okay.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.140
 We need to move on to the final fact very shortly, anything before we do?

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:06.220
 Quickly he had 52 cats, and he taught one of them, so this is his exact words, "I have taught

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:10.420
 Uncle Wolfer, Dillinger, and Will to make a pyramid like lions."

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.940
 I'm sorry, what?

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:16.540
 Well, I think he taught his cats to make a human pyramid, I'm not sure.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.540
 Like lions, do you?

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:27.460
 Yeah, and then he said, "And have taught friendless," that was the name of another of his cats, "have

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:33.260
 taught friendless to drink with me, brackets whiskey and milk, but even that doesn't take

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:37.140
 the place of a wife and family."

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:44.700
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the night, and that is Chuzinski.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:52.620
 Yeah, my fact is that the official medical diagnosis code for being struck by a chicken is different

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:58.940
 to the official medical diagnosis code for being pecked by a chicken.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:03.620
 So this is the International Classification of Diseases, the ICD, and everything that could

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:08.500
 go wrong with you has an ICD code, so it's now enormous, and every possible injury that's

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.540
 ever been reported has this code.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.860
 So yeah, there are codes for being pecked by a chicken and struck by a chicken, completely

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:14.860
 different codes.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:21.380
 There was one new one added in the '70s, which was bitten by an orca.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:29.480
 It's contact with non-venomous frogs, that's one, sucked into a jet engine, and injuries

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.180
 caused while knitting and crocheting.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:36.100
 So all of these things, if you go to a doctor or an ER, they'll write down, they'll say,

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.420
 "Oh, my knitting needle just jammed into my thigh," and then a non-venomous frog landed

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.260
 on it, and they'd say, "Oh, there are two codes for that, hold on," and write them down,

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.860
 and then they've reported it.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:54.420
 What is the code for was pulling on what I thought was toilet chain, turned out to be a skylight?

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:58.220
 There would definitely be one for that.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:05.500
 There is one for fall off toilet, that's w18.1, just let you know that.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:14.100
 A few others just because it's a 1593 page PDF, and I read through the whole thing yourself.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:25.020
 All from a non-moving, non-motorised scooter is W-05, and fall into bucket of water, not

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:35.660
 trip over bucket of water, but fall into bucket of water, that's W1622, and S30.862 is insect bite

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.660
 on penis.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:43.580
 That's amazing, long list reading.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:56.540
 This is my favourite one, V91.07, burn due to water skis on fire.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.340
 Don't smoke on water skis, you know what I'm saying?

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.860
 I was reading an interview with someone, so there's a brilliant Oscar the New Yorker about

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:05.860
 this.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.140
 He interviewed someone who's involved in deciding the new classifications because they

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.180
 quite recently upgraded it and expanded them.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.180
 It sounds quite frustrating.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.420
 You're in this meeting room and you're debasing all the things that could possibly happen

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:21.140
 as well, and asking if you should also have codes for them, and so she was saying a question

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:27.460
 was raised on what codes would apply if a mother was given the wrong baby to breastfeed.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:31.540
 It was stated that that would be outside the scope of ICD coding, so they do have some

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.540
 limits.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:37.940
 I read a thing about breastfeeding just this morning, which is that in the 19th century in America,

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.940
 if you had what's called Agalactica, which means you can't produce milk for your baby,

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.140
 the way that they were treated is to put a pancake on your breasts.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:50.540
 There's a substance, a milk substitute.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:56.580
 I don't know what they thought it would do, but you would put a warm pancake on the breast,

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.740
 and then when it got cold, you put another warm one on and keep doing that for a couple

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:00.740
 of hours.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:06.300
 What would they do with all the cold breast pancakes?

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:11.680
 Just make some new pancakes, I mean, that's very wasteful, yeah.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:19.020
 You could give them to perverts.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:25.620
 Just three pounds will buy four pancakes or a pervert.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.580
 I was reading about the fact that not only do they have these codes that they can write

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:34.660
 for proper medical use, but they actually, there's a lot of medical slang that gets used,

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:40.340
 which patients, because doctors are telling people at home, they're putting it on the internet,

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.340
 people are whizing up to the fact that they use this kind of slang.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.580
 So like, for example, one PFO, pissed, fell over.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.180
 That's what they'll put on the paper as a thing.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.780
 They'll put brothel sprouts, which is genital warts.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:58.380
 I really like brothel sprouts, very clever.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:05.060
 But yeah, I was reading about the fact that some doctor board now needs to tell doctors not

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.060
 to do this anymore.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.420
 So they sent out a mass email and different hospitals are doing this.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.420
 It's really funny, the fact that when they say it, this is a quote from it, although acknowledging

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:17.060
 that slang is likely to continue to be used, it should be kept to a minimum.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:22.220
 So they're like, well, we know you're going to do it anyway, so yeah, but it's, yeah, there's

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:31.580
 a whole pretpo, patient reassured and told to fuck off.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:36.900
 I have read articles like that and some doctors go on there and comment and say, no, we don't

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:37.900
 do this at all.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.380
 But then others go, yeah, we do really.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.820
 I've got two close friends of a doctor and both of them say they do it all the time.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:49.980
 Well, I was reading a thing about bills of mortality, which were these lists that got published

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.340
 in the 16th and 17th centuries.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:57.780
 And it was a record of how people died basically in your parish, for example, and every week the

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.620
 parish clerks would record who had died and the parish and how they died.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.260
 But they weren't medically trained, obviously, because they were clerks.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:09.060
 So a lot of the causes of death are really quite vague.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:16.140
 So they include things like, this is for how they died, gripping in the guts, we don't

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.940
 know, stopping of the stomach again.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:29.940
 And suddenly another, this is my favourite from the bills of mortality that I managed

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:50.620
 to read, was cancer and wolf.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.820
 Guys, we need to wrap up fairly soon, so if you've got any more.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:58.500
 I've got to think very quickly on chickens, which is, so this fact was about the medical

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:03.260
 code for chicken, and it just reminded me that I was reading about a, there's an Australian

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:09.660
 fast food chain called chicken treat, who currently have a chicken doing all of their tweets.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:14.420
 So, it basically, it's in its cage, they put a computer in there and they've put the food

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:20.940
 onto the keyboard, and so the chicken packs the keyboard for the food, and it starts typing

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:21.940
 stuff out.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:28.260
 And Guinness World Records have said that if it manages to type a five-letter word, and

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:32.260
 it's a successfully, it reads as a word, then it's going to go into the Guinness World Records

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.860
 as the first non-human to tweet.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.140
 So far, it's only managed three letters.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.340
 What was the word that it tweeted?

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.340
 Bum.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:45.340
 Anything more before we wrap up?

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:54.540
 Why couldn't you ask us to follow a chicken tweet to the word problem?

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.780
 Okay, that's all our backs then.
