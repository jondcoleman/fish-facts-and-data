00:00:10,00:00:17,">> Hello, and welcome to another episode."
00:00:17,00:00:20,"A no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast."
00:00:20,00:00:23,This week coming to you live from Newport.
00:00:23,00:00:25,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and please welcome to the stage."
00:00:25,00:00:28,"It's Anich Zinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray."
00:00:28,00:00:31,[APPLAUSE]
00:00:31,00:00:37,">> And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:37,00:00:40,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:40,00:00:42,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:44,"Starting with you, James Harkin."
00:00:44,00:00:48,">> Okay, my fact this week is that Grumpy from the Seven Dwarfs"
00:00:48,00:00:50,is not nearly Grumpy enough.
00:00:50,00:00:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:00:52,00:00:54,>> Sounds like an opinion.
00:00:54,00:00:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:00:55,00:00:56,">> It is an opinion, I'd say."
00:00:56,00:00:59,It's the opinion of some researchers from Duke University
00:00:59,00:01:00,and North Carolina.
00:01:00,00:01:02,And what they did is they looked in a load of movies
00:01:02,00:01:06,"that are aimed at children, so they would be rated you in the UK."
00:01:06,00:01:08,They split all the characters up in class.
00:01:08,00:01:11,"So you have your opera class, your middle class, and your lower class."
00:01:11,00:01:15,"And they decided that the depiction of working class was unrealistic,"
00:01:15,00:01:18,and that the Seven Dwarfs would not be singing cheerfully
00:01:18,00:01:20,as they walked down to the mind.
00:01:20,00:01:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:23,00:01:26,">> So James, who were the scientists?"
00:01:26,00:01:29,">> Yeah, they were just people at Duke University and North Carolina."
00:01:29,00:01:31,"To be honest, they are their cartoons, aren't they?"
00:01:31,00:01:34,You don't really expect them to be all that kind of realistic.
00:01:34,00:01:37,But scientists don't like it when you get things wrong.
00:01:37,00:01:41,"In the Lion King, they're hyenas in the Lion King and the bad guys."
00:01:41,00:01:45,And some of the artists for the film spent two days observing hyenas
00:01:45,00:01:48,in the hills above the campus of where they were.
00:01:48,00:01:51,"And the scientists who were with them said, look, hyenas are good guys."
00:01:51,00:01:54,"Don't depict them as idiots, as evil people."
00:01:54,00:01:55,And they did.
00:01:55,00:01:57,And then one of them sued.
00:01:57,00:01:58,>> What are the hyenas?
00:01:58,00:01:58,What are the hyenas?
00:01:58,00:01:59,>> One of the hyenas.
00:01:59,00:02:02,">> I mean, that is litigious."
00:02:02,00:02:05,And I think they are evil as a result of that.
00:02:05,00:02:07,">> Well, that wouldn't be very realistic either, would it?"
00:02:07,00:02:09,">> Now, it was one of the scientists sued, yeah."
00:02:09,00:02:11,">> I wouldn't watch that film, though."
00:02:11,00:02:14,"One of the hyenas from the original film, soos the mix."
00:02:14,00:02:17,">> This is the Lion King 3, which is like--"
00:02:17,00:02:19,so the Lion King's sort of based on Hamlet.
00:02:19,00:02:20,>> Yeah.
00:02:20,00:02:23,">> And then the Lion King 3 begins with Timon and Pumper,"
00:02:23,00:02:25,"the comedy characters, and they're based on"
00:02:25,00:02:29,Gildenstone and Rosencrantz in the original thing.
00:02:29,00:02:31,But then the Lion King 3 is based on Gildenstone and Rosencrantz
00:02:31,00:02:33,"and dead, the Tom Stopper play."
00:02:33,00:02:36,But then it begins with Timon and Pumper watching the Lion King 1
00:02:36,00:02:38,in a cinema.
00:02:38,00:02:39,This is how the Lion King 3 begins.
00:02:39,00:02:41,"And they say, that's not how it happened."
00:02:41,00:02:43,We're going to tell the story of how it actually happened.
00:02:43,00:02:44,And it's all the other bits.
00:02:44,00:02:48,So it's Gildenstone and Rosencrantz and Gildenstone and dead.
00:02:48,00:02:52,"But from the perspective of a war talk of America, amazing."
00:02:52,00:02:54,>> So on the Seven Doves.
00:02:54,00:02:55,So originally they have no names.
00:02:55,00:02:57,"In the Grim Brothers story, they have no names."
00:02:57,00:03:01,"And then when Disney did the famous film in 1937,"
00:03:01,00:03:04,they had about 50 potential names for the door switch
00:03:04,00:03:06,were slowly whittled down.
00:03:06,00:03:12,"And the rejected names included Jumpy, Defi, Hickey,"
00:03:12,00:03:19,"Baldi, Puffy, Stuffy and Orphal."
00:03:19,00:03:22,>> I actually made a list of my dream Seven Doves.
00:03:22,00:03:23,>> Okay.
00:03:23,00:03:26,>> I think that these were all on the Disney potentials list as well.
00:03:26,00:03:28,"There's Slotty, Hotsy and Chesty."
00:03:28,00:03:31,Which I think are obviously a bit of a threesome.
00:03:31,00:03:36,"And then Orphal, Guppy, Snourful and Big O Ego."
00:03:36,00:03:38,I think that would be a bit of Seven Doves.
00:03:38,00:03:39,>> Chesty.
00:03:39,00:03:40,>> Chesty.
00:03:40,00:03:41,>> Chesty.
00:03:41,00:03:49,>> I actually read that when they pick Dopey as one of the characters
00:03:49,00:03:52,"that people working at Disney said to Walt Disney,"
00:03:52,00:03:53,that that's not a good name to use.
00:03:53,00:03:55,Because this is meant to be an old tale.
00:03:55,00:03:59,And Dopey is a relatively recent hip name.
00:03:59,00:04:02,And so people will think that that's not a good name.
00:04:02,00:04:04,">> Oh yeah, because like Dope just meant good, didn't it?"
00:04:04,00:04:05,">> Yeah, exactly."
00:04:05,00:04:07,"And so Disney said, well, it's not a new name."
00:04:07,00:04:08,It was used in a Shakespeare play.
00:04:08,00:04:10,"So they went, oh, okay, of course, sorry."
00:04:10,00:04:11,>> He made that up.
00:04:11,00:04:14,"It was never, it was like, yeah, it's right here."
00:04:14,00:04:15,Dopey or not Dopey.
00:04:15,00:04:18,>> [LAUGH]
00:04:18,00:04:22,>> I actually once lost a school quiz off the back of a question of name
00:04:22,00:04:24,all the Seven Doves.
00:04:24,00:04:27,"We got six of them, and we were stuck on the seventh."
00:04:27,00:04:30,"And my friend, my best friend, Dan, suddenly went, oh my god,"
00:04:30,00:04:32,I know it because it's my dad's name.
00:04:32,00:04:35,"So, what's his name?"
00:04:35,00:04:37,>> Sneezy.
00:04:37,00:04:39,">> His dad, his dad was a rock star in Australia."
00:04:39,00:04:41,Really a big rock star for Doc Neeson.
00:04:41,00:04:43,"And he goes, I know it."
00:04:43,00:04:46,"Now, Doc is not his dad's real name."
00:04:46,00:04:50,So what he ended up putting on the paper as the seventh dwarf was burnard.
00:04:50,00:04:54,>> [LAUGH]
00:04:54,00:04:54,>> Are we looking at him?
00:04:54,00:04:55,>> Are you sure?
00:04:55,00:04:57,>> He's definitely grown up.
00:04:57,00:04:59,"Everyone's like, oh, I like the dwarf."
00:04:59,00:05:01,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:01,00:05:06,">> So there's some controversy about this fact, because obviously as a study,"
00:05:06,00:05:10,"some would say it is fatuous, the word has been used."
00:05:10,00:05:15,But I was around this table studying this kind of thing and drawing these conclusions.
00:05:15,00:05:17,So I was looking at other potentially fatuous studies.
00:05:17,00:05:23,"And so there were two studies, one in 2008 and one in 2013 looking at how films can"
00:05:23,00:05:25,affect people psychologically.
00:05:25,00:05:27,"And so whether you know we should be worried about the effect of Hollywood films,"
00:05:27,00:05:30,"for instance, on society and ourselves."
00:05:30,00:05:35,"2008, there was an Edinburgh University recruited a hundred volunteers."
00:05:35,00:05:41,And the study deduced that fans of romantic comedies have a stronger belief in pre-destin love.
00:05:41,00:05:43,And they have more unrealistic expectations for relationships.
00:05:43,00:05:48,"So romantic comedies, bad, give us unrealistic expectations of relationships."
00:05:48,00:05:52,">> 2013, there was another study looking into exactly the same thing."
00:05:52,00:05:56,Found that there is no correlation between people who are interested in watching romantic comedies.
00:05:56,00:05:59,And people who have unrealistic ideas about love.
00:05:59,00:06:02,">> So really, you can make a study say whatever it is you want to prove."
00:06:02,00:06:08,They'd be good if the leads of those two papers got together and then had a beautiful relationship.
00:06:08,00:06:14,">> Yeah, that's a thing, I know that sometimes they do seem like they shouldn't have been done."
00:06:14,00:06:17,But I love the studies that make no sense.
00:06:17,00:06:19,"Here's a great one I really like, this from 2005."
00:06:19,00:06:21,This is what the study was about.
00:06:21,00:06:23,Far away objects are tougher to see.
00:06:23,00:06:25,>> [LAUGH]
00:06:25,00:06:27,>> And they confirm that to be true.
00:06:27,00:06:28,>> [LAUGH]
00:06:28,00:06:31,>> Swallowing more than one magnet is dangerous.
00:06:31,00:06:34,>> [LAUGH]
00:06:34,00:06:38,">> There is, I think it is a problem with kids because magnets are sold down as"
00:06:38,00:06:40,"office stress relievers, I think."
00:06:40,00:06:42,"And yeah, apparently, sure."
00:06:42,00:06:44,But if you swallow one it is bad.
00:06:44,00:06:49,But there are like hundreds of people who have met E.R.'s in America every year.
00:06:49,00:06:51,Kids who have swallowed two of them.
00:06:51,00:06:54,"And obviously that really screws up your intestines because as soon as you swallow the second one,"
00:06:54,00:06:59,they try to find each other in your insides and disrupt everything else in the meantime.
00:06:59,00:07:00,So that is quite bad.
00:07:00,00:07:01,>> That is amazing.
00:07:01,00:07:03,">> We need to move on to our next fact, does anyone have anything before we do?"
00:07:03,00:07:09,>> I can give you one more study that's kind of a bit fatuous but also about Disney stuff.
00:07:09,00:07:13,So they did this thing where they had men watching movies.
00:07:13,00:07:16,And they had so much with sad movies and so much with happy movies.
00:07:16,00:07:19,"And the happy movie was the jungle book, which would make everyone happy."
00:07:19,00:07:24,And so they made them watch this jungle book and then they took swabs from their armpits.
00:07:24,00:07:28,And then they gave the swabs to women and asked them to smell them and
00:07:28,00:07:32,smell all the different armpits that people who've watched all the different movies.
00:07:32,00:07:37,"And they found that people who'd watched happier movies when you smell their armpits, it makes you smile more."
00:07:37,00:07:39,>> What?
00:07:39,00:07:43,">> I mean, you can't be smiling much because you're smelling an armpit."
00:07:43,00:07:45,">> Yeah, it could be more of a grimace."
00:07:45,00:07:52,">> Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:07:52,00:07:56,>> My fact this week is that the ancient Romans had party bags.
00:07:56,00:08:02,">> So in ancient Rome, if you went to a dinner party at the end of it,"
00:08:02,00:08:06,you would be given a thing called an apophoretor which literally means a take away.
00:08:06,00:08:08,So they invented takeaways as well.
00:08:08,00:08:14,And we know about them because there was a poet called Marshall and he wrote a whole book about them.
00:08:14,00:08:19,"It's 221 pairs of lines and it's everything, the things that were given away."
00:08:19,00:08:28,"So they included toothpaste, whips, seashells, bladder foots, or I think I translated this right, a pastry penis."
00:08:28,00:08:31,>> It does get that grexty.
00:08:31,00:08:38,">> That's true and he said, even if you consume every part of it, you will not be the less pure."
00:08:38,00:08:45,>> So you had this huge range of things you could be given at the end of the night.
00:08:45,00:08:46,It was very exciting.
00:08:46,00:08:47,>> Wow.
00:08:47,00:08:50,">> You could also take your food away at the end of the night after Roman parties, couldn't you?"
00:08:50,00:08:51,>> They had a doggy bag.
00:08:51,00:08:53,>> They had doggy bags.
00:08:53,00:08:56,"They were the inventors of the doggy bag, which is unbelievably cool."
00:08:56,00:08:57,I think it was called a map.
00:08:57,00:08:59,"You had to bring your own doggy bag sometimes, I think."
00:08:59,00:09:03,"So it was called a mapai or a mapai, I guess, in the singular."
00:09:03,00:09:05,And it was a piece of cloth and you'd bring it.
00:09:05,00:09:08,"And if you had leftovers, you wrap them up and you take them away with you."
00:09:08,00:09:09,">> Wow, that's really interesting."
00:09:09,00:09:15,I remember reading once that there were a lot of houses in Rome which were above shops.
00:09:15,00:09:17,"And if you lived in one of these flats,"
00:09:17,00:09:21,they were quite low-roofed and they didn't want people like their shops to catch on fire.
00:09:21,00:09:23,So you weren't allowed to cook in them.
00:09:23,00:09:26,"And so if you wanted to eat anything, you had to get everything take away."
00:09:26,00:09:26,>> Really?
00:09:26,00:09:27,>> Yeah.
00:09:27,00:09:29,">> Wait, it's just a fact."
00:09:29,00:09:30,>> That's amazing.
00:09:30,00:09:31,">> Yeah, it's got that, isn't it?"
00:09:31,00:09:35,So you want to go to these parties all the time to bring your doggy bag home.
00:09:35,00:09:37,>> So what were the parties like back then?
00:09:37,00:09:38,Were they wild?
00:09:38,00:09:38,Were they raucous?
00:09:38,00:09:41,>> I think they varied like parties today then.
00:09:41,00:09:42,>> All right.
00:09:42,00:09:45,">> The more I looked into it, they had hot tub parties."
00:09:45,00:09:46,>> I found out.
00:09:46,00:09:47,>> Which I didn't know about.
00:09:47,00:09:48,>> Did they have toga parties?
00:09:48,00:09:52,">> They didn't wear togas most of the time, did they?"
00:09:52,00:09:53,>> Did they not?
00:09:53,00:09:54,>> I think they wore tunics.
00:09:54,00:09:55,">> Yeah, I think they hated them, didn't they?"
00:09:55,00:09:59,"They had to wear them every now and then, but they were really awkward to wear."
00:09:59,00:10:01,Was it not Roosevelt had a toga party?
00:10:01,00:10:05,Because people took the Mickey out of him and said that he was acting like a Caesar.
00:10:05,00:10:08,"And so his wife kind of threw a party, as if to say,"
00:10:08,00:10:12,"like as if to cock a snooke to the man, I believe that."
00:10:12,00:10:13,>> He was the man.
00:10:13,00:10:14,>> What are you talking about?
00:10:14,00:10:15,">> Right, yeah."
00:10:15,00:10:16,>> To the little man.
00:10:16,00:10:17,>> To the little man.
00:10:17,00:10:20,">> Yeah, Roman parties, it's good question."
00:10:20,00:10:22,"One of the things that I've always thought would be, you've been awkward at Roman parties,"
00:10:22,00:10:24,is the fact that everyone had to lie down.
00:10:24,00:10:29,"And so at dinner parties, everyone lay down, as we know, and you'd have a couch arrangement"
00:10:29,00:10:33,where there would be a couch or a bed on three walls of the room.
00:10:33,00:10:35,And you'd have the hosts on the middle couch.
00:10:35,00:10:38,"And then the top guests, there were seating plans."
00:10:38,00:10:40,So I think they also came up with seating plans.
00:10:40,00:10:43,And the most favored guests would get the couch where you had the better view of the
00:10:43,00:10:46,"host, and you had a really nice view out of the building."
00:10:46,00:10:48,And then the less favored guest just got a view of the wall.
00:10:48,00:10:53,And you had to lie down and you lay on like your left arm and ate your food with your
00:10:53,00:10:54,right arm.
00:10:54,00:10:56,It just sounds really uncomfortable.
00:10:56,00:11:02,>> So another thing that Roman's invented was the concept of deal or no deal.
00:11:02,00:11:06,"In that, this is invented by the emperor Augustus."
00:11:06,00:11:14,He asked his guests to bid sums of money for pictures when they were faced to the wall.
00:11:14,00:11:18,"So you had to bid a sum of money on a picture, which you couldn't see the value of it."
00:11:18,00:11:21,And I gather that that is what happens.
00:11:21,00:11:22,>> That is exactly the same.
00:11:22,00:11:27,">> So that is, and then they turn the painting round to reveal it at the end."
00:11:27,00:11:28,>> Yeah.
00:11:28,00:11:29,>> Cool.
00:11:29,00:11:30,>> That is amazing.
00:11:30,00:11:31,That is deal or no deal.
00:11:31,00:11:32,>> That is deal or no deal.
00:11:32,00:11:33,>> Wow.
00:11:33,00:11:38,">> He said, you also when you went to a dinner party with Augustus, you would pay for a token"
00:11:38,00:11:40,and it was inscribed with what you might get.
00:11:40,00:11:42,But they varied hugely.
00:11:42,00:11:45,So you couldn't really see what was on the token before you bought it.
00:11:45,00:11:47,"So again, it was like a blind auction."
00:11:47,00:11:48,>> That is like a lucky dip.
00:11:48,00:11:50,>> Like a lucky dip.
00:11:50,00:11:53,And so you could either get some gold or you could get a sponge.
00:11:53,00:11:55,So it was really varied.
00:11:55,00:12:01,"And then, a later emperor, Ella Gabelus, he gave out things called lucky chances, which"
00:12:01,00:12:03,were these special spoons and it was inscribed with what you'd want.
00:12:03,00:12:07,"And it might say ten on it and you'd redeem it and they'd say, oh, you've won ten pounds"
00:12:07,00:12:10,of gold or it might be that you won ten flies or something.
00:12:10,00:12:11,So really varied.
00:12:11,00:12:16,And they started giving them out at the Coliseum and when they had a lottery at the games
00:12:16,00:12:21,"in the Coliseum, it was, you just won a token and you'd redeem it and see what you'd"
00:12:21,00:12:22,want.
00:12:22,00:12:23,>> Wow.
00:12:23,00:12:24,>> You might have won ten bears.
00:12:24,00:12:25,">> How terrifying to have the ten, yeah."
00:12:25,00:12:29,>> You'd wonder ten times I have sex with your wife.
00:12:29,00:12:31,>> It could be anything.
00:12:31,00:12:36,>> You shouldn't ever run the lottery.
00:12:36,00:12:39,>> We need to move on to our next fact and I want to go anything else.
00:12:39,00:12:45,>> I can quickly tell you that there's £808 million spent on party bags for children's
00:12:45,00:12:47,parties in the UK every year.
00:12:47,00:12:48,>> Wow.
00:12:48,00:12:49,>> £808 million.
00:12:49,00:12:55,"Apparently, the average bag is worth £7.50, which I think means there's £107 million"
00:12:55,00:13:02,"party bags, which means every child gets 30 each, so it goes to 30 parties every year."
00:13:02,00:13:03,>> Every year.
00:13:03,00:13:04,>> Yeah.
00:13:04,00:13:11,">> I didn't know 30 people had a certain, certainly not 30 would have had me talk to them."
00:13:11,00:13:17,>> And apparently 2% of a thousand parents serving in one survey said that their child had
00:13:17,00:13:20,received an iPod in a party bag.
00:13:20,00:13:21,>> Wow.
00:13:21,00:13:22,>> Wow.
00:13:22,00:13:26,>> Even they serving people in Chelsea mansions.
00:13:26,00:13:32,"I read a news article, an American news article, a mother called Sherry Jamison, who was"
00:13:32,00:13:38,"left speechless when she had a birthday party for her son, her six-year-old son, and"
00:13:38,00:13:41,guests took back the birthday gifts they'd given him when they found out there were going
00:13:41,00:13:44,to be no party bags.
00:13:44,00:13:49,"The article reported about a party goer who asked to remain anonymous, saying a lot of us"
00:13:49,00:13:53,"feel cheated, the kids had fun, but it was a really bare bones event."
00:13:53,00:13:57,"It's not like she had a bouncy castle, and she's since received emails and texts from guests"
00:13:57,00:14:01,"who felt it would be in poor taste to take their gift back at the party, but who are now"
00:14:01,00:14:05,"getting in touch to demand to be refunded the full price, including tax of their present."
00:14:05,00:14:06,>> Including tax.
00:14:06,00:14:09,>> Let the tax go.
00:14:09,00:14:15,">> Let's move on to our next fact, so we don't run out of time."
00:14:15,00:14:19,"So it's time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:14:19,00:14:24,"My fact this week is that Ernest Hemingway once stole a urinal from a bar, saying that he"
00:14:24,00:14:32,pissed away so much of his money into it that he owned it.
00:14:32,00:14:36,">> I can tell you from experience, that very rarely works on landlords."
00:14:36,00:14:43,">> Steve, this is on all your financials."
00:14:43,00:14:48,">> Yeah, so this was a bar that he used to go to all the time, and it was moving, it was"
00:14:48,00:14:53,"closing down, and so he just went in, and he just took the urinal off, and he brought it"
00:14:53,00:14:55,back to his house.
00:14:55,00:14:58,"And James, I know you've been to Ernest Hemingway's house."
00:14:58,00:15:00,">> I have been there, and the urinal is still there."
00:15:00,00:15:01,>> Really?
00:15:01,00:15:02,">> Yeah, it's still there, you can see it."
00:15:02,00:15:06,"And when you go to Ernest Hemingway's house in Key West, they make you go on a tour"
00:15:06,00:15:10,"around there, and that's one of the things they tell you that this is the story."
00:15:10,00:15:13,"Because urinal is now in the garden, I think, and it's right, it's in the back garden."
00:15:13,00:15:17,">> And it's been turned into a fountain, or it's a nice centerpiece."
00:15:17,00:15:19,">> I think it's quite a nice urinal, actually."
00:15:19,00:15:24,"If my memory serves, it's quite big and made of big stone, and it's kind of got flowers"
00:15:24,00:15:25,on it and stuff.
00:15:25,00:15:26,I think it's quite nice.
00:15:26,00:15:27,>> Wow.
00:15:27,00:15:28,>> Hopefully.
00:15:28,00:15:30,>> How did he get it out of the bar?
00:15:30,00:15:33,Because I wouldn't know where to begin taking your urinal off the wall.
00:15:33,00:15:37,">> He was a big, manly man there, and you know, you're-"
00:15:37,00:15:38,>> I understand.
00:15:38,00:15:41,>> He was enjoying your wine over there.
00:15:41,00:15:43,>> You've made yourself very plain.
00:15:43,00:15:47,">> He was a big guy though, you're right, he was obsessed with boxing."
00:15:47,00:15:52,"He used to take on people half his age, saying, and probably, you know, same size as him,"
00:15:52,00:15:54,"but assume being younger, they could take him out."
00:15:54,00:15:55,And he would-
00:15:55,00:15:57,>> He had his own boxing ring in the back garden.
00:15:57,00:16:00,It was next to where the urinal now is.
00:16:00,00:16:04,And he went off to the Spanish Civil War to act as a correspondent.
00:16:04,00:16:07,"While he was there, he had an affair with another woman."
00:16:07,00:16:12,"And his wife wasn't very happy about that, so she sold his boxing ring and bought a swimming"
00:16:12,00:16:13,pool.
00:16:13,00:16:18,"And that swimming pool cost $20,000 in those days, which now is hundreds and hundreds of"
00:16:18,00:16:19,thousands.
00:16:19,00:16:23,"And when he came back, he had one penny in his pocket, and he said, you've taken everything"
00:16:23,00:16:26,"I've got, have this last penny, and he threw it down, and it's still there under a bit"
00:16:26,00:16:27,of glass.
00:16:27,00:16:28,And you can see it if you visit.
00:16:28,00:16:33,">> A good, we preserve the remnants of his childish, spoiled brat tantrums."
00:16:33,00:16:34,[laughter]
00:16:34,00:16:39,">> On his manliness, I love this image."
00:16:39,00:16:42,"He wrote standing up, always."
00:16:42,00:16:44,"He wrote, he would write in pencil."
00:16:44,00:16:49,"He wouldn't be wearing a shirt, so he had a shirt off wore baggy shorts, and they were held"
00:16:49,00:16:56,up by a leather belt that he'd taken off the body of a dead German soldier that was inscribed
00:16:56,00:16:59,with the German III Reich kind of insignia.
00:16:59,00:17:00,>> Wow.
00:17:00,00:17:01,">> That's cool, isn't it?"
00:17:01,00:17:06,>> A half naked man with a third Reich belt standing up and writing some novels.
00:17:06,00:17:07,>> I think we know your type.
00:17:07,00:17:08,[laughter]
00:17:08,00:17:14,">> Just on the pub fights thing, I read that he went out drinking with James Joyce, and"
00:17:14,00:17:20,"that James Joyce would get into fights, and then say, hemmingway, deal with this, because"
00:17:20,00:17:22,"he was too drunk, that Joyce was too drunk to stand."
00:17:22,00:17:24,This is according to Hemmingway.
00:17:24,00:17:28,"I have a fact about Ernest Hemmingway, which is that Hemmingway was part kangaroo."
00:17:28,00:17:29,[laughter]
00:17:29,00:17:34,>> Have you got dozens notes there?
00:17:34,00:17:37,">> No, he was."
00:17:37,00:17:38,He was part kangaroo.
00:17:38,00:17:39,>> Come on.
00:17:39,00:17:43,">> He broke his arm in a car accident, and the surgeon tending him bound his bone together"
00:17:43,00:17:45,inside his body with kangaroo tendon.
00:17:45,00:17:46,>> Wow.
00:17:46,00:17:53,">> Yeah, and this wasn't an innovation just for Hemmingway, at some point, a standard medical"
00:17:53,00:17:55,procedure to put a bit of kangaroo inside you.
00:17:55,00:17:56,>> That's so cool.
00:17:56,00:17:59,">> It feels like the tendons would be kind of stretchier, doesn't it, a bounceier."
00:17:59,00:18:00,>> Yeah.
00:18:00,00:18:01,>> I wonder if they would.
00:18:01,00:18:02,>> Maybe why they used it.
00:18:02,00:18:03,"I mean, I don't know."
00:18:03,00:18:04,But anyway.
00:18:04,00:18:07,">> It's not like all bits of a kangaroo, a bounceier, James."
00:18:07,00:18:08,>> I don't know.
00:18:08,00:18:09,[laughter]
00:18:09,00:18:10,>> The lovely rubber.
00:18:10,00:18:13,">> Do you know when he was a young boy, Ernest Hemmingway, when he was a young boy, his"
00:18:13,00:18:16,"mother used to dress him up as a girl, because she didn't want a boy."
00:18:16,00:18:20,"She wanted a girl, and so she used to dress him up as a girl, and call him Ernestine."
00:18:20,00:18:21,>> Oh.
00:18:21,00:18:23,">> Backfired very badly, didn't it?"
00:18:23,00:18:24,>> It really did.
00:18:24,00:18:28,">> But it was up until like he was six years old, he was going around."
00:18:28,00:18:33,"She grew his hair long, and he had to pretend to be the twin sister of his older sister."
00:18:33,00:18:34,>> Wow.
00:18:34,00:18:35,>> Yeah.
00:18:35,00:18:36,>> They're pretty weird family.
00:18:36,00:18:37,>> I read he didn't like his name.
00:18:37,00:18:40,"He didn't like being called Ernest, because it was like the hero of an importance of being"
00:18:40,00:18:41,Ernest by Oscar Wilde.
00:18:41,00:18:42,">> Oh, really?"
00:18:42,00:18:46,">> And he was upset about that, because that was why he objected, because he thought."
00:18:46,00:18:48,>> He thought Oscar Wilde was a feminist.
00:18:48,00:18:51,">> Oscar Wilde was a feminist, and therefore that he shouldn't be called Ernest."
00:18:51,00:18:56,">> He had huge problems about wanting to be incredibly masculine, a sort of hyper-masculine,"
00:18:56,00:18:59,"and a really, seriously odd guy."
00:18:59,00:19:03,">> He was also, honestly, go home and spend two hours researching Ernest Hemingway, because"
00:19:03,00:19:07,"you think, as I was saying to James yesterday, as you're really about him, you think, I have"
00:19:07,00:19:08,not lived.
00:19:08,00:19:10,This man has lived.
00:19:10,00:19:15,"And in so many ways, one of the ways was that he was incredibly accident prone, it seems,"
00:19:15,00:19:18,so he had this old kangaroo malachina on.
00:19:18,00:19:25,"He had a plane crash in 1954, so he was on safari with his wife, he was in Uganda, and his"
00:19:25,00:19:29,"plane crash had to crash land, and they had to choose whether to crash land on an elephant"
00:19:29,00:19:31,trail or in a big crocodile pit.
00:19:31,00:19:37,">> So, these are the only options, and he was a tiny strip of land in between the elephant"
00:19:37,00:19:38,trail.
00:19:38,00:19:39,"Look, look at how big."
00:19:39,00:19:40,What are we at?
00:19:40,00:19:41,What do they pick?
00:19:41,00:19:43,>> They pick the elephant trail.
00:19:43,00:19:44,">> Of course, yeah."
00:19:44,00:19:47,">> As they've had it in the elephant trail, then he, his wife and the pilot of the plane,"
00:19:47,00:19:51,"had to sleep there overnight, because they were surrounded by elephants, blocked in by"
00:19:51,00:19:52,these elephants.
00:19:52,00:19:56,"So, they were both quite badly injured, and the next day they were rescued by another plane,"
00:19:56,00:20:02,"so they boarded this other plane, which caught fire, and also crashed the following day."
00:20:02,00:20:03,>> Where did that crash into?
00:20:03,00:20:09,>> Do you want to go to the snake pit on the Will the Beast to a sanctuary?
00:20:09,00:20:12,>> I would pick the Will the Beast to a sanctuary.
00:20:12,00:20:17,">> Don't be calm, I've been looked after."
00:20:17,00:20:21,>> Maybe we can adopt one.
00:20:21,00:20:26,>> What if Earth comes after Will the Beast for that joke to make sense?
00:20:26,00:20:28,>> What about the hyena land?
00:20:28,00:20:30,>> What about that?
00:20:30,00:20:34,">> Actually, hyena's quite nice guys."
00:20:34,00:20:37,">> I actually read a thing about Will the Beast the other day, that I was going to try to"
00:20:37,00:20:43,"use for a vague fact, scientists were saying that they were looking ancient Will the Beast,"
00:20:43,00:20:49,"and apparently ancient Will the Beasts, they evolved a trunk, like a longish trunk, so that"
00:20:49,00:20:50,they could gossip with each other.
00:20:50,00:20:51,>> Yeah.
00:20:51,00:20:55,">> Because they needed to tell each other, like just you'd Jeff over there, like they needed"
00:20:55,00:21:00,"to tiny little bits of gossip, and they couldn't do it with their normal Will the Beast"
00:21:00,00:21:01,face.
00:21:01,00:21:02,>> What?
00:21:02,00:21:07,">> I feel like you're paraphrasing this, though."
00:21:07,00:21:08,>> What did it say?
00:21:08,00:21:09,>> I'm gossiping.
00:21:09,00:21:12,">> Do you know where Hemingway's biggest scar came from, so he had this big scar on his"
00:21:12,00:21:13,forehead.
00:21:13,00:21:16,"It was the most prominent thing he'd noticed about him in his life, and it didn't come from"
00:21:16,00:21:21,the car crash or from the two plane crashes or from the motorbike accident he had when he
00:21:21,00:21:22,was in Germany.
00:21:22,00:21:24,>> Are the wass that he was kind of any of the wass he covered.
00:21:24,00:21:28,"It came from a time he was in a bathroom, and he pulled the chain, thinking it was the"
00:21:28,00:21:33,"toilet flush, and it accidentally brought the whole skylight down on his head, and that's"
00:21:33,00:21:37,"what gave him this massive scar, and whenever anyone asked him about it, he was really"
00:21:37,00:21:40,"reluctant to say, it's from a toilet skylight."
00:21:40,00:21:45,">> The two plane crashes, there was an interesting thing that actually happened in the time between"
00:21:45,00:21:50,"the first plane crash and the second plane crash, which was he and his wife were reported dead,"
00:21:50,00:21:55,"and it got spread around the world, and obituaries were printed the next day, and so he had the"
00:21:55,00:22:00,"rare thing of being able to genuinely see the obituaries to his life, and then the next"
00:22:00,00:22:04,"day he got on a plane, and then that crashed again, and that led to severe trauma, which"
00:22:04,00:22:08,"his best friends think is what led to the end of his life, for him killing himself from that"
00:22:08,00:22:12,"second plane crash, I think it just ruined the rest of his life."
00:22:12,00:22:16,"But again, you know you're saying just what an insane character, what a big life, he during"
00:22:16,00:22:23,"World War II was hunting Nazis, despite not being enlisted into World War II, and he did"
00:22:23,00:22:28,"it from his boat, and his boat was set up, it was a fishing boat, it had direction finding"
00:22:28,00:22:34,"equipment, it had a machine gun, it had grenades, and he went out hunting Nazi U-boats."
00:22:34,00:22:39,He used to practice with his son trying to take down U-boats with grenades by throwing them
00:22:39,00:22:40,at turtles.
00:22:40,00:22:49,"I think that was very unfair on the turtles, A) you're implying their Nazis, and B) a U-boat"
00:22:49,00:22:54,"is a lot tougher than a turtle, but that's what he did, okay."
00:22:54,00:22:58,"We need to move on to the final fact very shortly, anything before we do?"
00:22:58,00:23:06,"Quickly he had 52 cats, and he taught one of them, so this is his exact words, ""I have taught"
00:23:06,00:23:10,"Uncle Wolfer, Dillinger, and Will to make a pyramid like lions."""
00:23:10,00:23:11,"I'm sorry, what?"
00:23:11,00:23:16,"Well, I think he taught his cats to make a human pyramid, I'm not sure."
00:23:16,00:23:19,"Like lions, do you?"
00:23:19,00:23:27,"Yeah, and then he said, ""And have taught friendless,"" that was the name of another of his cats, ""have"
00:23:27,00:23:33,"taught friendless to drink with me, brackets whiskey and milk, but even that doesn't take"
00:23:33,00:23:37,"the place of a wife and family."""
00:23:37,00:23:44,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the night, and that is Chuzinski."
00:23:44,00:23:52,"Yeah, my fact is that the official medical diagnosis code for being struck by a chicken is different"
00:23:52,00:23:58,to the official medical diagnosis code for being pecked by a chicken.
00:23:58,00:24:03,"So this is the International Classification of Diseases, the ICD, and everything that could"
00:24:03,00:24:08,"go wrong with you has an ICD code, so it's now enormous, and every possible injury that's"
00:24:08,00:24:10,ever been reported has this code.
00:24:10,00:24:13,"So yeah, there are codes for being pecked by a chicken and struck by a chicken, completely"
00:24:13,00:24:14,different codes.
00:24:14,00:24:21,"There was one new one added in the '70s, which was bitten by an orca."
00:24:21,00:24:29,"It's contact with non-venomous frogs, that's one, sucked into a jet engine, and injuries"
00:24:29,00:24:31,caused while knitting and crocheting.
00:24:31,00:24:36,"So all of these things, if you go to a doctor or an ER, they'll write down, they'll say,"
00:24:36,00:24:40,"""Oh, my knitting needle just jammed into my thigh,"" and then a non-venomous frog landed"
00:24:40,00:24:44,"on it, and they'd say, ""Oh, there are two codes for that, hold on,"" and write them down,"
00:24:44,00:24:46,and then they've reported it.
00:24:46,00:24:54,"What is the code for was pulling on what I thought was toilet chain, turned out to be a skylight?"
00:24:54,00:24:58,There would definitely be one for that.
00:24:58,00:25:05,"There is one for fall off toilet, that's w18.1, just let you know that."
00:25:05,00:25:14,"A few others just because it's a 1593 page PDF, and I read through the whole thing yourself."
00:25:14,00:25:25,"All from a non-moving, non-motorised scooter is W-05, and fall into bucket of water, not"
00:25:25,00:25:35,"trip over bucket of water, but fall into bucket of water, that's W1622, and S30.862 is insect bite"
00:25:35,00:25:36,on penis.
00:25:36,00:25:43,"That's amazing, long list reading."
00:25:43,00:25:56,"This is my favourite one, V91.07, burn due to water skis on fire."
00:25:56,00:26:00,"Don't smoke on water skis, you know what I'm saying?"
00:26:00,00:26:04,"I was reading an interview with someone, so there's a brilliant Oscar the New Yorker about"
00:26:04,00:26:05,this.
00:26:05,00:26:09,He interviewed someone who's involved in deciding the new classifications because they
00:26:09,00:26:12,quite recently upgraded it and expanded them.
00:26:12,00:26:13,It sounds quite frustrating.
00:26:13,00:26:16,You're in this meeting room and you're debasing all the things that could possibly happen
00:26:16,00:26:21,"as well, and asking if you should also have codes for them, and so she was saying a question"
00:26:21,00:26:27,was raised on what codes would apply if a mother was given the wrong baby to breastfeed.
00:26:27,00:26:31,"It was stated that that would be outside the scope of ICD coding, so they do have some"
00:26:31,00:26:32,limits.
00:26:32,00:26:37,"I read a thing about breastfeeding just this morning, which is that in the 19th century in America,"
00:26:37,00:26:42,"if you had what's called Agalactica, which means you can't produce milk for your baby,"
00:26:42,00:26:46,the way that they were treated is to put a pancake on your breasts.
00:26:46,00:26:50,"There's a substance, a milk substitute."
00:26:50,00:26:56,"I don't know what they thought it would do, but you would put a warm pancake on the breast,"
00:26:56,00:26:59,"and then when it got cold, you put another warm one on and keep doing that for a couple"
00:26:59,00:27:00,of hours.
00:27:00,00:27:06,What would they do with all the cold breast pancakes?
00:27:06,00:27:11,"Just make some new pancakes, I mean, that's very wasteful, yeah."
00:27:11,00:27:19,You could give them to perverts.
00:27:19,00:27:25,Just three pounds will buy four pancakes or a pervert.
00:27:25,00:27:29,I was reading about the fact that not only do they have these codes that they can write
00:27:29,00:27:34,"for proper medical use, but they actually, there's a lot of medical slang that gets used,"
00:27:34,00:27:40,"which patients, because doctors are telling people at home, they're putting it on the internet,"
00:27:40,00:27:43,people are whizing up to the fact that they use this kind of slang.
00:27:43,00:27:46,"So like, for example, one PFO, pissed, fell over."
00:27:46,00:27:50,That's what they'll put on the paper as a thing.
00:27:50,00:27:53,"They'll put brothel sprouts, which is genital warts."
00:27:53,00:27:58,"I really like brothel sprouts, very clever."
00:27:58,00:28:05,"But yeah, I was reading about the fact that some doctor board now needs to tell doctors not"
00:28:05,00:28:06,to do this anymore.
00:28:06,00:28:09,So they sent out a mass email and different hospitals are doing this.
00:28:09,00:28:13,"It's really funny, the fact that when they say it, this is a quote from it, although acknowledging"
00:28:13,00:28:17,"that slang is likely to continue to be used, it should be kept to a minimum."
00:28:17,00:28:22,"So they're like, well, we know you're going to do it anyway, so yeah, but it's, yeah, there's"
00:28:22,00:28:31,"a whole pretpo, patient reassured and told to fuck off."
00:28:31,00:28:36,"I have read articles like that and some doctors go on there and comment and say, no, we don't"
00:28:36,00:28:37,do this at all.
00:28:37,00:28:39,"But then others go, yeah, we do really."
00:28:39,00:28:43,I've got two close friends of a doctor and both of them say they do it all the time.
00:28:43,00:28:49,"Well, I was reading a thing about bills of mortality, which were these lists that got published"
00:28:49,00:28:52,in the 16th and 17th centuries.
00:28:52,00:28:57,"And it was a record of how people died basically in your parish, for example, and every week the"
00:28:57,00:29:01,parish clerks would record who had died and the parish and how they died.
00:29:01,00:29:04,"But they weren't medically trained, obviously, because they were clerks."
00:29:04,00:29:09,So a lot of the causes of death are really quite vague.
00:29:09,00:29:16,"So they include things like, this is for how they died, gripping in the guts, we don't"
00:29:16,00:29:19,"know, stopping of the stomach again."
00:29:19,00:29:29,"And suddenly another, this is my favourite from the bills of mortality that I managed"
00:29:29,00:29:50,"to read, was cancer and wolf."
00:29:50,00:29:53,"Guys, we need to wrap up fairly soon, so if you've got any more."
00:29:53,00:29:58,"I've got to think very quickly on chickens, which is, so this fact was about the medical"
00:29:58,00:30:03,"code for chicken, and it just reminded me that I was reading about a, there's an Australian"
00:30:03,00:30:09,"fast food chain called chicken treat, who currently have a chicken doing all of their tweets."
00:30:09,00:30:14,"So, it basically, it's in its cage, they put a computer in there and they've put the food"
00:30:14,00:30:20,"onto the keyboard, and so the chicken packs the keyboard for the food, and it starts typing"
00:30:20,00:30:21,stuff out.
00:30:21,00:30:28,"And Guinness World Records have said that if it manages to type a five-letter word, and"
00:30:28,00:30:32,"it's a successfully, it reads as a word, then it's going to go into the Guinness World Records"
00:30:32,00:30:34,as the first non-human to tweet.
00:30:34,00:30:37,"So far, it's only managed three letters."
00:30:37,00:30:40,What was the word that it tweeted?
00:30:40,00:30:41,Bum.
00:30:41,00:30:45,Anything more before we wrap up?
00:30:45,00:30:54,Why couldn't you ask us to follow a chicken tweet to the word problem?
00:30:54,00:30:58,"Okay, that's all our backs then."
