00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.800
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.680
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.680
 My name is Dan Triber.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.920
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andy Murray, and today's special guest is author

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.960
 of a new book called Male Obsession, It's Mark Mason.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.400
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.200
 the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go, starting with you and Andy

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.200
 Murray."

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.280
 My fact is that for the Queen's coronation, people dressed up as television sets.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.960
 "This is past the giggle test, Andy."

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.440
 So this is, I read this in an article by the historian Kate Williams in the Observer,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.960
 and it seems to come from a book of policemen's memoirs, or one of the first female beat

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.280
 police officers wrote a book of memoirs about her experiences.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.720
 She describes it, and I think a couple of other sources say it as well.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.120
 So this is because it was such a huge thing for it to be televised, televisions were brought

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.640
 in huge numbers across the country for the coronation.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.120
 I think 20 million people watched, and on average there were 17 people watching each TV

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.120
 set.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.120
 And you think of TVs at the time, there were tiny, you know, screens, a few inches from

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.120
 corner to corner.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.240
 So you would just go to the person in your street who had a TV and you were exactly there.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.840
 Do you know what went up in sales as well?

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.840
 No.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.920
 Not massively in sales, so did massive magnifying glasses.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.760
 So they didn't magnify it so that more people could come and see.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.760
 Really?

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.360
 I got that from Kate Williams's Twitter stream.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.880
 They were specially made, weren't they?

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.320
 They made special rectangular ones that were made to fit on to the front of the casing

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.760
 for your television, which of course in those days was a big piece of furniture.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.760
 Yeah, they made them specially.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.080
 That was fantastic.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.080
 The thing about TVs going up in numbers is definitely true.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.160
 But in 1950, there were 400,000 TV licenses in '51, there were 700,000, and in '53 there were

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
 1,100,000.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.720
 So they did go up when the coronation was on, but actually they had been going up for quite

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.720
 a long time.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.800
 So it wasn't just the coronation that caused a big increase in TV sales.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.800
 Right.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.760
 I think it's true that the one part of the ceremony that wasn't shown, because it would

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.760
 be seen as too, you know, there was a big debate about whether you should be televising

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.760
 something like this full stock.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.760
 Did it demean the occasion?

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.600
 But they didn't show the actual coronation moment where the crowns put on her head.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.080
 I think that was actually tradition though, because I read about this where they hold the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.680
 canopy above her head, and it's a secret part.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.880
 No one knows what happens in that part.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.400
 I think that was a good idea, which is that the crown goes on to the head.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.200
 No, no, because there's more, because there's the spoon and the spoon.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200
 You have to explain.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.040
 The Archbishop of the Canterbury Spoon is the queen.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.040
 Orking.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.040
 So is it only the Archbishop and the queen under the canopy at that point?

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.040
 What?

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.040
 I don't know.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.040
 Yeah.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.600
 They make a den.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.040
 All we know is what we can make out from the silhouettes of the flashlights going on on

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.040
 the inside.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.800
 But there's definitely a spoon.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.240
 That's what we see.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.520
 So the ceremonial spoon comes out.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.520
 Okay.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.520
 And oil is poured.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.520
 And oil.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.520
 Anointing oil.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.520
 Anointing stuff, I think.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.520
 Yeah.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.840
 And so, and apparently it's the only surviving thing from the Middle Ages.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.360
 This is part of the tradition.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.800
 It's the only thing that's made its way through.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.160
 It unites her forehead, her breast, and her hands.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.040
 But you say in that during the coronation, the Archbishop of the Canterbury, Iled up the

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.240
 queen's breast according to what I read, yeah.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.560
 What is definitely true about the Archbishop of Canterbury on that occasion, 1953, was that

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.080
 he had to give the queen a push to get her started.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.800
 When she practiced, she pinned heavy curtains to her shoulders to simulate the coronation

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.800
 robe.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.400
 When it came to the real thing, the coronation robes were even heavier than she expected.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.400
 And she couldn't get them because she's quite a small woman.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.120
 She was 20, whatever she was then.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.840
 She said that she whispered to the Archbishop of Canterbury.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840
 Give me a shot.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.400
 I think the exact phrase was to get me started.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.400
 That's it.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400
 Give me a shot.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.400
 Wow.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.400
 That's very cool.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.200
 More on the Archbishop at the time, who was a very interesting guy, George Fischer.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.360
 So he was dead against it being televised for a number of reasons.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.400
 He thought it might demean the occasion and he really wanted people to join in for the

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.600
 hymn if they were watching at home and stand up for the homage part of the ceremony.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.560
 And there was so much debate about this all across the country.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.040
 One MP said in the House of Commons, "Might there even be something unseemly in the chance

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.040
 that a viewer could watch this solemn and significant service with a cup of tea at

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.040
 his elbow?"

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.440
 I learned the fact that they installed extra toilets in the app because there were so many

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.280
 guests and also TV crews and everyone working on it.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.920
 They installed extra toilets at the Abbey and then did a sound check to check that if by

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.600
 chance they were all flushed at the same time, the BBC's microphones wouldn't pick them

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600
 up.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.600
 Wow.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.600
 That's preparation.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.600
 Yeah.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.520
 And the choir boys were given packed lunches containing peanut butter and marmalade sandwiches

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.800
 to have the opposite effect from, you know, making them go to it.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.520
 They wanted to bun them up so they wouldn't need to go to the toilet.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.320
 And they were also given really big drinks, canisters, so that once they'd had their drink, if they

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.960
 needed to refill that drink's canister, it would say that it was so good.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.680
 Did they find out what the sound of 200 choir boys peeing into that canister sounded like?

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.840
 Could the BBC mics pick that up, yeah?

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.040
 I think this is quite well known, but I didn't know it.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.000
 Keith Richards was one of the choir boys at the choir.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.680
 I'm afraid it turns out that Keith was certainly a great choir boy, certainly sang for

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.560
 the Queen, but they think a couple of years later it wasn't actually in the choir.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.560
 Which is so disappointing.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.560
 Has no one asked him?

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.880
 No one can understand the answer.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.080
 I think he would have been, well, he was born, he would be a bit young.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.440
 This is where my inner nerd comes out.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.760
 He was born December the 18th, 1943, so yeah, he would have been nine.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.080
 So he would have been the right hoes then?

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.240
 Yeah, he was certainly in the ballpark, but not in the alley.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.640
 That was so nerdy, Mark, coming onto our podcast, if anyone has not read Keith, which

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.760
 is autobiography, it is, I was fine, in my minutes the best book, no, mine's just out.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.760
 It's the second best book.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.760
 No, you're just out.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.280
 It's the third best book of the 21st century.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.280
 We got two out this year.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.440
 And it's the fourth best book, Keith.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:22.240
 There's one cool bit of the coronation which didn't happen for Victoria, in fact, Victoria

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.120
 was the first person that didn't happen for, so have you heard about the Queen's Champion?

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.120
 No.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.720
 Okay, so in medieval coronations, and Victoria's was the first coronation that didn't happen

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.520
 for, so everyone before then it happened.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.520
 The Queen's Champion, all the King's Champion, is a noble.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.920
 And for the post coronation banquet, this person would come in in full armour and throw down

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.360
 his gauntlet and then challenge anyone to a fight if they said the sovereign was not fit

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.120
 to rule or didn't have the right to rule.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.120
 Wow.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.120
 I think we should bring that back.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.120
 It's so good.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.120
 I reckon Brian blessed his bomb.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.120
 Yes, exactly.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.760
 There is still a Queen's Champion, so it's a hereditary position, even though they don't

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.360
 do it at coronations anymore.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.360
 He's called Francis.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.200
 He started a countenance.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.760
 His full name is Francis John Fein, Marmian Dimock.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.800
 And as far as I can tell, as it's a hereditary title, he is the current Queen's Champion.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.800
 How does he look?

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.800
 Like.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.640
 He just looks like a nice man.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.000
 You can't actually tell how he looks because he's wearing a full suit of armour at all

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 times.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 What can it do?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.080
 Do we know he's the countenance office?

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.040
 Like, who challenges the Queen's right to rule?

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.880
 Because the one thing that did happen at the Queen's coronation dinner that hadn't happened

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.320
 before was that her mother, as she became the Queen mother, wouldn't let her have too much

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.320
 to drink.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.360
 Remember, you have to reign all afternoon.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.040
 She didn't want her daughter getting drunk at the lunch.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.720
 And also, of course, coronation chicken was invented for the occasion.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.760
 That's where it gets its name, especially created early.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.760
 Oh, though.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.240
 It's very similar to Jubilee Chicken, which was invented a few years earlier for the

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.680
 Silver Jubilee of Joyce Afef.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.680
 How is it?

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.240
 And which is basically chicken with mayonnaise and spices.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.680
 I'm pretty much exactly the same thing.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.160
 But then they, let's say, reinvented it for the coronation.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.480
 So I always call it Jubilee Chicken when I go.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.480
 Oh.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.880
 Can I have a Jubilee Chicken Panino, please?

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:23.080
 Do you know that on that day when they dressed in, as TV sets, that's not the only thing that

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.080
 they dressed as?

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.080
 No.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.080
 They dressed as Mount Everest as well.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.080
 Yeah.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.680
 Well, it's been conquered the day before.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.680
 Exactly.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.680
 And the news had come through.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.680
 So they were celebrating a number of things.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.040
 And Mount Everest was a massive celebration.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.480
 So people would dress as TV sets and Mount Everest.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.480
 That's amazing.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.480
 Yeah.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.080
 What a big news day.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.080
 Yeah.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.880
 Everest and the coronation are the same day.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.880
 That's massive.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.880
 Yeah.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.480
 Do you know there's a conspiracy that we didn't, that Hillary didn't get to the top of Mount

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.480
 Everest?

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.480
 Really?

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.480
 Yeah.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.480
 And it's actually really interesting, the reason why.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.600
 And the way that the news got broken to the British public was via a journalist called James

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.800
 Morris, who has changed sex and is now Jan Morris, one of the most famous travel riders

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.800
 alive.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.920
 Now Jan Morris got the scoop.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.000
 Was there when Hillary came down, when he said the words, "We knocked the bastard off

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.520
 George" and got the scoop.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.680
 Now here was the thing.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.320
 She didn't know how to get, or here at the time, didn't know how to get the message back

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.520
 without it being infiltrated and then spread around the world because he wanted the scoop.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.800
 So what he ended up sending was a coded message that he'd pre-arranged to be sent back.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.640
 And this was the message that actually went back.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.760
 The message went, "Snow conditions bad, stop.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.240
 Advanced base abandoned yesterday.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.240
 Stop.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.240
 A waiting improvement."

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.160
 So the message was to say that they haven't made it.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.160
 Wow.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.120
 And people actually think that he was telling the truth there.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.280
 So what message did he send if they didn't make it then?

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.960
 Good news, everyone.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.800
 That's a good point.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.800
 Yeah.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.680
 OK, time for fact number two.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.160
 And that is James.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:03.000
 OK, my fact this week is that the world puddle jumping championships, bands, fizzy drinks,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.120
 in case they improve participants' performance.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.600
 Talks through the science behind them.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.640
 Well, it's weird because on QI, we have said that fizzy drinks don't make children more

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.640
 hyperactive.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.680
 And in the world puddle jumping championships, it's usually children.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.640
 In fact, it's always children taking part.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.680
 But they think that if you give them fizzy drinks, then they will become more excitable, more

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.840
 hyperactive, and it could enable them to jump higher and make bigger splashes than other

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840
 competitors.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.800
 And they don't want to encourage people to drink fizzy drinks, because it's not good for

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.800
 you.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.800
 And so they've decided to ban it.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.400
 I think that's very sweet.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.200
 Apart from the ban element of it.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.840
 It could be a placebo thing, couldn't it, if you've heard your parents have written the

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.280
 news that it makes you jump better, then that could have effect.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.560
 Well, what we've said on QI, and I can't remember quite the science behind it, is that

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:53.240
 the children actually act exactly the same, but it's the adults who then kind of fuss around

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.720
 them and think, oh, they're hyperactive, they're hyperactive.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:00.000
 And when you get someone who's watching the events happening, who doesn't know whether

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.400
 or not they've had fizzy drinks, they can't tell the difference with the children.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.800
 How do they monitor it, though?

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.840
 Like, how do you test for fizzy drinking?

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.560
 Is it a P sample?

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.600
 I think they just ban them from the general area of the competition, so maybe you could

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.080
 like, stock up on Red Bull the night before.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:24.800
 I was reading the Metro newspaper, covered this, and the line they used was, this is not

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.560
 the first time sporting contest have been marred by doping associations.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.040
 Lance Armstrong was tripping seven.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.560
 So what they do is it's based on height of jump, enthusiasm, distance of splash and stick

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.040
 ability, which is the amount of mud, which clings to each competitor, all those different things.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.080
 My favourite element of that is enthusiasm, it's being marred.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.360
 That's basically code for, as with any event where you're giving prizes to kids, the one

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.480
 that looks most likely to burst into tears if you don't win, yes, the win, because you just

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480
 don't want a scene.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.520
 And it'd be good in the Olympics if the most enthusiastic competitors are living.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.040
 In the Tarder France, they'll give it, whoever is the most aggressive on the day, they'll

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.640
 give a prize to even if they don't win.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.640
 Really?

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.640
 Yeah.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.600
 What someone who's like, kicked other bisonists off the track, aggression in this case means

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.480
 that you're making attacks earlier and trying to, trying to be of the race on what?

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.480
 Yeah, right.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.480
 Okay.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.800
 The whole notion of jumping, to forget all this thing about cricket being in the Olympics,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.760
 I want the campaign to put the standing long jump back into the Olympics.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.760
 The standing long jump.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.480
 Because it used to be in until 1912, I think.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.880
 And the record is still going, even though not in the Olympics.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.480
 The record for the standing long jump was broken earlier this year, 23rd of February,

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:42.720
 2015, the Dallas Cowboys cornerback did a standing long jump of 12 feet, two and three quarter

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.960
 inches, which is the length of the snooker table from a standing.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.320
 But then the other bizarre thing about the standing long jump is that it is a condition

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.160
 of entry to serve in the Brazilian police, to serve in the Brazilian police.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.240
 You have to do a stat, if you're a man, you need to be able to do a standing long jump

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.440
 of 2.14 meters, if you're a woman, 1.66, there's no way I could do that.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.440
 That's great.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.440
 That's incredible.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.440
 I couldn't.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.440
 Should we do it?

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.440
 And then say what our score is going to be.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.440
 OK, we're going to do a quick cut here.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.440
 Yeah.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.440
 We do this for the morning.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.440
 Yeah.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.440
 Two meters.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.440
 Yeah.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.440
 That was really fun.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440
 Right.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.440
 Anyway.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.880
 So we're still recording.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.720
 And we found out that Andy is the best at the standing long jump by about five centimeters.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.720
 Yeah.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.720
 I mean.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.360
 And we all reckon we were getting around two meters, so we don't think we can get into

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.360
 the Brazilian.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.360
 But only by a few centimeters.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.120
 So if we work on it, we might be able to do it.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.760
 Did we make it into the Brazilian ladies army?

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.760
 Yes, we did.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.760
 1.66.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.760
 Get in.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.760
 All right.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.960
 OK, I want to do some things about drugs and performance enhancing drugs.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:55.200
 So Peta Coda, who's a tennis player, he tested positive for the steroid Nandralone in

00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:01.160
 Wimbledon in 1998, but he blamed it on having eaten too much steroid fed veal.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.160
 OK.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.920
 And it turned out that if he had eaten enough veal to be tested positive, he would have had

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.920
 to have eaten 40 calves a day for 20 years to have such high level.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.240
 And there was an Olympic gold medalist called Dennis Mitchell, who tested positive for high

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.840
 testosterone.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.560
 And he claimed that it was because he consumed five beers the night before and had sex with

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.560
 his wife four times.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.560
 That's ridiculous.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.360
 No one can have five beers.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:37.680
 If I was the veal guy and I was being investigated, I like to think that I would have tried to prove

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.680
 that.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.840
 And when the investigators are coming out, I would have ordered a load of calves and been constantly

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:49.840
 using a calf just all over my house and my garden full of calves.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.600
 This park where they had this puddle-tumping thing, it's called Wixsteed Park, and Wixsteeds

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.600
 make playgrounds.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.600
 Yep.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.600
 Yeah.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.600
 And did you hear about the guy, Charles Wixsteed?

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.600
 Yeah.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600
 This is incredible.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.240
 The best thing about the fact, I think.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.560
 He invented the slide and the swing.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.560
 Two things.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.560
 Two things.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.560
 Two things.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.560
 That was a good morning, wasn't it?

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.560
 Yeah.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.560
 He invented the slide.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.560
 Give us more details.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.800
 Well, people say that he invented the modern slide.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.440
 Now, I have found a source which disputes this and points out there are a couple of earlier

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.240
 things in New York, which look a lot like slides.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.760
 So it's possible that he didn't invent the very first slide.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:32.720
 He definitely came up with a version of it for his park and he also invented the modern

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.320
 swing, which you get in playgrounds.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.160
 And his first version, have you seen it?

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.160
 No.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.480
 The top bar is almost four meters off the ground.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.320
 It looks incredibly dangerous.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.320
 Yeah.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.320
 There's photos that have been on Earth.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.600
 I don't know if you've ever seen the sort of extreme swinging.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.600
 It's kind of like that.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.320
 I think I've seen extreme swinging.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.800
 Just Google that, anyone at home.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.760
 He didn't grow up in the suburbs and not...

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.720
 But what he kind of also pioneered was the idea of the playground and this park where

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.140
 the puddle jumping competition was held is the park where the first ever playground was

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.140
 built.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.480
 And he used pipes from World War I, Eddie, turned them into swings.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.560
 So they became the first swings and you can see the first slides as well.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.560
 They're really interesting.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:19.060
 The first slides were polished planks of wood with no sides, you just went down a plank

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.060
 of wood.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.060
 Risking a broken leg and splinters.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:25.380
 Yeah, and kids, you can see them going down it and it's just very dangerous.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.700
 They were also gender segregated, one for boys and one for girls.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.700
 Yeah.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.740
 He said later on that was an old fashioned.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:38.260
 He realized that was an old fashioned notion and he abandoned that segregation.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.220
 And so they know where the oldest modern day swing then in the world is and it's not in

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.820
 the park, it's in the backyard of Charles Wixsteed's home, which they discovered not too

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.180
 long ago and it was his prototype.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:53.700
 And so now that we know officially the oldest swing in the world is still working, it's still

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.700
 working.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:01.780
 But no, it is not like an iPhone that goes out there.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.700
 Okay, time for fact number three and that is Mark.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:11.300
 My fact is that the shuttlecocks used in professional badminton are made using real goose feathers

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.380
 which are always taken from the birds left wing.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.380
 Wow.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:20.900
 So I kind of knew that it was taken from an animal, I thought it was duck, I think ducks can

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.900
 be used in your defence.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.900
 Right.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.980
 I don't think that's the stupidest mistake anyone's ever made.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.900
 But I didn't know the left wing.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.060
 Yeah, well apparently if they use, if you get them from the left wing, it makes the shuttle

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.260
 cock spin clockwise.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.580
 If you turn them from the right wing, it makes the shuttle cock spin anti-clockwise.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.300
 And they're obviously used to playing with the clockwise spin and that's why they keep

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.620
 using those wings.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.220
 So if you have one which was half with feathers from the left wing and half from the right wing,

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.220
 would it not spin?

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.020
 It would go completely, yeah, it would be a completely haphazard.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.020
 Really?

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.020
 Yeah.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.000
 So if you took the feathers from a bird's right wing and you can put them on its left wing,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.500
 so I had two left wings.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.500
 You'd be arrested.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.820
 But you're right, they do take them from a live animal because animals will regrow them.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:09.020
 So I don't know if they keep harvesting the same bird to get more shuttlecocks out of it.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.140
 But it does apparently cause the birding to goose incredible pain when they're taken

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.140
 out.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.140
 So you then regrow.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.940
 You know when someone does, I don't know, your eyebrows?

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.940
 Yeah.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.440
 That in itself is a bit like, oh, that's quite painful, imagine like at the bottom of feathers

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.440
 it's almost sticks.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:27.060
 Well, I think it's more akin to pulling out toenails rather than hairs, isn't it?

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.060
 Damn it.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:33.260
 I read this incredible fact which is if a bold eagle loses a feather on one of its wings,

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.700
 it will shed the corresponding feather on the opposite wing to maintain balance.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.700
 Now that.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.700
 Wow.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.700
 Isn't that amazing?

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.140
 You're fundamentally Christians will pick up on to show that there is a god that's just

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.140
 astonishing, isn't it?

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.140
 Wow.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.140
 How quickly would it do it?

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.140
 I reckon just straight away.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.820
 So if you were, if you happen to be plucking a bold eagle and you took one out, you'd just

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.540
 see another one go, on the other side.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.860
 That would be useful if you're like a turkey plucker or something and you'd only have to

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:58.860
 do half the turkey.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.860
 Yeah.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.740
 Do they pluck it out their own feather or do they, can they selectively shed a single

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.740
 feather?

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.940
 I believe that's what I read.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:10.540
 Now I, I actually don't believe it myself, but that's what I read in a reputable source.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.540
 I read it.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.540
 I read it.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.540
 I read it.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.540
 I think that's what I read.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.380
 This is where Dan's cheekly boyish grin is causing it, easy winding us up here, but no,

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.380
 that's what I read.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.540
 It's no more than four feathers from the same goose for the same shuttlecock.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.580
 I've heard that once they had a feather on it, they'd have a feather on it and they'd

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.580
 have a feather on it.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.580
 I think that's what I read.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.580
 This is where Dan's cheeky boyish grin is causing it easy winding us up here, but

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.580
 no, that's what I read.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.580
 It's no more than four feathers from the same goose for the same shuttlecock.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.580
 I've heard that once they had a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:59.580
 have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:09.580
 have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:35.580
 I've heard that once they had a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd

00:20:35.580 --> 00:21:01.580
 have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:10.580
 they'd have a feather on it.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:28.580
 It's a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:44.580
 they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:21:44.580 --> 00:22:02.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:22.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:43.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:22:43.580 --> 00:23:01.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:19.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:40.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:58.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:16.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:34.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:52.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:24:52.580 --> 00:25:10.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:37.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:58.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:16.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:34.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:52.580
 and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:26:52.580 --> 00:27:07.580
 if we have a 2,000 year old jar of honey and a modern day jar of honey you can have the 2,000 year old one

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:13.580
 it's such a ridiculous thing and porn is the anyone involved in making it knows it's the most unerotic thing that you're doing with a film

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:18.580
 and famously and don't look now when Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie were supposed to have done it for real

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:26.580
 when the love scene Donald Sutherland says if you've had a film crew around you you'll know how unerotic it is and how difficult it would be to do it

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:31.580
 but the notion of the fluffer I found out recently apparently it's a myth that the fluffer exists at all

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:41.580
 the fluffer does we don't know the fluffer is and I guess it's normally a woman who's paid to ready the man for his performance to get him into a physical state where he's ready to perform

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:47.580
 and that's just a complete myth if you're a male porn performer you're expected to be ready and if you're not ready then you won't get the job

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:54.580
 and also I love the fact that the people who clean the London Underground lines overnight when the tubes shut overnight they're called fluffers as well

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.580
 so I think there is only one true job called a fluffer and it's the one that clean the tube

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:04.580
 oh imagine your disappointment when you find out when you applied for fluffer you're down in the London Underground

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:14.580
 I found another Egyptian book that has been sort of a mysterious book that we haven't quite cracked and decoded

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:20.580
 and they've recently they think they've managed to decode it properly and this is Macquarie University in Australia

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.580
 I think they've managed to do it and it's a thousand three hundred years old this text

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.580
 and they think what it turns out to be is that it's a book of spells

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:33.580
 some of the spells that they've translated include a spell for someone who is possessed

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:39.580
 someone who is annoyed at you as a spell for that that a woman might conceive

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:46.580
 and when someone has a magic on them you've got a magic on you

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:50.580
 and I like that though this is someone who's annoyed at you

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.580
 I think that's a fantastic spell

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.580
 and you can just do a magic on them and they'll not be annoyed with you

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.580
 exactly that's great

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.580
 there's another one called the Greek Magical Papyrus

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:07.580
 and that gives you explanations for ingredients in other magics as you might call them

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.580
 so if a magic spell asks for a head of a snake it's actually a leech

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.580
 and if it asks for crocodile dung it's Egyptian earth

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:19.580
 and if it asks for lion's semen you should use human semen

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.580
 but for the magical spells

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:27.580
 so people often thought that these magic spells that they were doing had like the head of a snake in or lion's semen in

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.580
 but actually they were much more normal objects

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.580
 thinking back in those days who would want the job of collecting the lion's semen

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.580
 you know I mean now they do it straight from the testicle I think

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.580
 I know they knock it out and collect it

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.580
 no I think the lions have a fluffer don't they?

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:46.580
 isn't there a thought that the idea of them changing the words or changing

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.580
 the terms is almost the copyright of its day

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:54.580
 it was to it was the secret ingredient to Coca-Cola type things

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.580
 is it yeah that's why I read with Babylonian semen

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.580
 the secret ingredient of Coca-Cola

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:05.580
 for legal reasons I think you have to say that lion's semen

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.580
 I think they found that from Babylonian tunaeiform

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.580
 that they thought that they were like look at all these odd ingredients

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:15.580
 and they realized that they were coded words kind of like the Jan Morris code from Everest

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:20.580
 so that no one could steal the proper incantation and the ingredients for us

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.580
 this is just quite interesting next year playboy

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.580
 no more nude women in playboy they're getting rid of

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:30.580
 so it's all going to be sort of tasteful tasteful in quotation marks

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.580
 what they think is tasteful

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.580
 for you always say that you read that for the articles down don't you?

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.580
 no I collect old ones because yeah Hunter S. Thompson used to write for them

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:42.580
 Woody Allen and Grapchow Marx and yeah extraordinary comic articles in there

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.580
 and now I can read it again for the articles

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:46.580
 very exciting

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:53.580
 okay that's it that's all of our facts

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.580
 thank you so much for listening if you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.580
 about the things we've said over the course of this podcast

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.580
 we can be found on Twitter I'm on @Streiberland

 Mark I'm @WaltTheLinesLDN

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.580
 it's details of the book

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.580
 there's anyone's the book it's M-A-I-L male obsession

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:15.580
 yep male obsession and it's the idea is that you go around the country to all the post-codes

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.580
 and you find out it's basically a book full of amazing facts

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.580
 along with a journey around the UK

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.580
 it's a book full of British trivia, British history, British weirdness that's been going on

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.580
 and it's using post-code areas as the device yet

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:31.580
 124 post-code areas at least one fact from each post-code area

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.580
 yep awesome that's out in the shops go get it now

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.580
