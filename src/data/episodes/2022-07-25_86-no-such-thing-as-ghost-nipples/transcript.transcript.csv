00:00:00,00:00:14,"""Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:14,00:00:17,to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:17,00:00:18,My name is Dan Triber.
00:00:18,00:00:22,"I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andy Murray, and today's special guest is author"
00:00:22,00:00:25,"of a new book called Male Obsession, It's Mark Mason."
00:00:25,00:00:29,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from"
00:00:29,00:00:34,"the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go, starting with you and Andy"
00:00:34,00:00:35,"Murray."""
00:00:35,00:00:40,"My fact is that for the Queen's coronation, people dressed up as television sets."
00:00:40,00:00:43,"""This is past the giggle test, Andy."""
00:00:43,00:00:48,"So this is, I read this in an article by the historian Kate Williams in the Observer,"
00:00:48,00:00:54,"and it seems to come from a book of policemen's memoirs, or one of the first female beat"
00:00:54,00:00:58,police officers wrote a book of memoirs about her experiences.
00:00:58,00:01:01,"She describes it, and I think a couple of other sources say it as well."
00:01:01,00:01:06,"So this is because it was such a huge thing for it to be televised, televisions were brought"
00:01:06,00:01:08,in huge numbers across the country for the coronation.
00:01:08,00:01:15,"I think 20 million people watched, and on average there were 17 people watching each TV"
00:01:15,00:01:16,set.
00:01:16,00:01:19,"And you think of TVs at the time, there were tiny, you know, screens, a few inches from"
00:01:19,00:01:20,corner to corner.
00:01:20,00:01:24,So you would just go to the person in your street who had a TV and you were exactly there.
00:01:24,00:01:25,Do you know what went up in sales as well?
00:01:25,00:01:26,No.
00:01:26,00:01:30,"Not massively in sales, so did massive magnifying glasses."
00:01:30,00:01:33,So they didn't magnify it so that more people could come and see.
00:01:33,00:01:34,Really?
00:01:34,00:01:36,I got that from Kate Williams's Twitter stream.
00:01:36,00:01:37,"They were specially made, weren't they?"
00:01:37,00:01:42,They made special rectangular ones that were made to fit on to the front of the casing
00:01:42,00:01:44,"for your television, which of course in those days was a big piece of furniture."
00:01:44,00:01:45,"Yeah, they made them specially."
00:01:45,00:01:47,That was fantastic.
00:01:47,00:01:51,The thing about TVs going up in numbers is definitely true.
00:01:51,00:01:58,"But in 1950, there were 400,000 TV licenses in '51, there were 700,000, and in '53 there were"
00:01:58,00:02:00,"1,100,000."
00:02:00,00:02:03,"So they did go up when the coronation was on, but actually they had been going up for quite"
00:02:03,00:02:04,a long time.
00:02:04,00:02:07,So it wasn't just the coronation that caused a big increase in TV sales.
00:02:07,00:02:08,Right.
00:02:08,00:02:12,"I think it's true that the one part of the ceremony that wasn't shown, because it would"
00:02:12,00:02:15,"be seen as too, you know, there was a big debate about whether you should be televising"
00:02:15,00:02:16,something like this full stock.
00:02:16,00:02:17,Did it demean the occasion?
00:02:17,00:02:21,But they didn't show the actual coronation moment where the crowns put on her head.
00:02:21,00:02:26,"I think that was actually tradition though, because I read about this where they hold the"
00:02:26,00:02:28,"canopy above her head, and it's a secret part."
00:02:28,00:02:30,No one knows what happens in that part.
00:02:30,00:02:33,"I think that was a good idea, which is that the crown goes on to the head."
00:02:33,00:02:37,"No, no, because there's more, because there's the spoon and the spoon."
00:02:37,00:02:38,You have to explain.
00:02:38,00:02:42,The Archbishop of the Canterbury Spoon is the queen.
00:02:42,00:02:43,Orking.
00:02:43,00:02:47,So is it only the Archbishop and the queen under the canopy at that point?
00:02:47,00:02:48,What?
00:02:48,00:02:49,I don't know.
00:02:49,00:02:50,Yeah.
00:02:50,00:02:51,They make a den.
00:02:51,00:02:55,All we know is what we can make out from the silhouettes of the flashlights going on on
00:02:55,00:02:56,the inside.
00:02:56,00:02:57,But there's definitely a spoon.
00:02:57,00:02:59,That's what we see.
00:02:59,00:03:01,So the ceremonial spoon comes out.
00:03:01,00:03:02,Okay.
00:03:02,00:03:03,And oil is poured.
00:03:03,00:03:04,And oil.
00:03:04,00:03:05,Anointing oil.
00:03:05,00:03:06,"Anointing stuff, I think."
00:03:06,00:03:07,Yeah.
00:03:07,00:03:09,"And so, and apparently it's the only surviving thing from the Middle Ages."
00:03:09,00:03:11,This is part of the tradition.
00:03:11,00:03:13,It's the only thing that's made its way through.
00:03:13,00:03:17,"It unites her forehead, her breast, and her hands."
00:03:17,00:03:22,"But you say in that during the coronation, the Archbishop of the Canterbury, Iled up the"
00:03:22,00:03:28,"queen's breast according to what I read, yeah."
00:03:28,00:03:32,"What is definitely true about the Archbishop of Canterbury on that occasion, 1953, was that"
00:03:32,00:03:37,he had to give the queen a push to get her started.
00:03:37,00:03:42,"When she practiced, she pinned heavy curtains to her shoulders to simulate the coronation"
00:03:42,00:03:43,robe.
00:03:43,00:03:47,"When it came to the real thing, the coronation robes were even heavier than she expected."
00:03:47,00:03:49,And she couldn't get them because she's quite a small woman.
00:03:49,00:03:51,"She was 20, whatever she was then."
00:03:51,00:03:53,She said that she whispered to the Archbishop of Canterbury.
00:03:53,00:03:54,Give me a shot.
00:03:54,00:03:56,I think the exact phrase was to get me started.
00:03:56,00:03:57,That's it.
00:03:57,00:03:58,Give me a shot.
00:03:58,00:03:59,Wow.
00:03:59,00:04:00,That's very cool.
00:04:00,00:04:05,"More on the Archbishop at the time, who was a very interesting guy, George Fischer."
00:04:05,00:04:10,So he was dead against it being televised for a number of reasons.
00:04:10,00:04:15,He thought it might demean the occasion and he really wanted people to join in for the
00:04:15,00:04:20,hymn if they were watching at home and stand up for the homage part of the ceremony.
00:04:20,00:04:22,And there was so much debate about this all across the country.
00:04:22,00:04:27,"One MP said in the House of Commons, ""Might there even be something unseemly in the chance"
00:04:27,00:04:31,that a viewer could watch this solemn and significant service with a cup of tea at
00:04:31,00:04:32,"his elbow?"""
00:04:32,00:04:37,I learned the fact that they installed extra toilets in the app because there were so many
00:04:37,00:04:40,guests and also TV crews and everyone working on it.
00:04:40,00:04:45,They installed extra toilets at the Abbey and then did a sound check to check that if by
00:04:45,00:04:50,"chance they were all flushed at the same time, the BBC's microphones wouldn't pick them"
00:04:50,00:04:51,up.
00:04:51,00:04:52,Wow.
00:04:52,00:04:53,That's preparation.
00:04:53,00:04:54,Yeah.
00:04:54,00:05:00,And the choir boys were given packed lunches containing peanut butter and marmalade sandwiches
00:05:00,00:05:03,"to have the opposite effect from, you know, making them go to it."
00:05:03,00:05:06,They wanted to bun them up so they wouldn't need to go to the toilet.
00:05:06,00:05:11,"And they were also given really big drinks, canisters, so that once they'd had their drink, if they"
00:05:11,00:05:15,"needed to refill that drink's canister, it would say that it was so good."
00:05:15,00:05:20,Did they find out what the sound of 200 choir boys peeing into that canister sounded like?
00:05:20,00:05:22,"Could the BBC mics pick that up, yeah?"
00:05:22,00:05:25,"I think this is quite well known, but I didn't know it."
00:05:25,00:05:28,Keith Richards was one of the choir boys at the choir.
00:05:28,00:05:33,"I'm afraid it turns out that Keith was certainly a great choir boy, certainly sang for"
00:05:33,00:05:37,"the Queen, but they think a couple of years later it wasn't actually in the choir."
00:05:37,00:05:38,Which is so disappointing.
00:05:38,00:05:40,Has no one asked him?
00:05:40,00:05:44,No one can understand the answer.
00:05:44,00:05:49,"I think he would have been, well, he was born, he would be a bit young."
00:05:49,00:05:50,This is where my inner nerd comes out.
00:05:50,00:05:53,"He was born December the 18th, 1943, so yeah, he would have been nine."
00:05:53,00:05:55,So he would have been the right hoes then?
00:05:55,00:05:59,"Yeah, he was certainly in the ballpark, but not in the alley."
00:05:59,00:06:03,"That was so nerdy, Mark, coming onto our podcast, if anyone has not read Keith, which"
00:06:03,00:06:07,"is autobiography, it is, I was fine, in my minutes the best book, no, mine's just out."
00:06:07,00:06:08,It's the second best book.
00:06:08,00:06:09,"No, you're just out."
00:06:09,00:06:11,It's the third best book of the 21st century.
00:06:11,00:06:12,We got two out this year.
00:06:12,00:06:15,"And it's the fourth best book, Keith."
00:06:15,00:06:22,"There's one cool bit of the coronation which didn't happen for Victoria, in fact, Victoria"
00:06:22,00:06:26,"was the first person that didn't happen for, so have you heard about the Queen's Champion?"
00:06:26,00:06:27,No.
00:06:27,00:06:32,"Okay, so in medieval coronations, and Victoria's was the first coronation that didn't happen"
00:06:32,00:06:35,"for, so everyone before then it happened."
00:06:35,00:06:38,"The Queen's Champion, all the King's Champion, is a noble."
00:06:38,00:06:43,"And for the post coronation banquet, this person would come in in full armour and throw down"
00:06:43,00:06:49,his gauntlet and then challenge anyone to a fight if they said the sovereign was not fit
00:06:49,00:06:51,to rule or didn't have the right to rule.
00:06:51,00:06:52,Wow.
00:06:52,00:06:53,I think we should bring that back.
00:06:53,00:06:54,It's so good.
00:06:54,00:06:55,I reckon Brian blessed his bomb.
00:06:55,00:06:56,"Yes, exactly."
00:06:56,00:06:59,"There is still a Queen's Champion, so it's a hereditary position, even though they don't"
00:06:59,00:07:01,do it at coronations anymore.
00:07:01,00:07:02,He's called Francis.
00:07:02,00:07:05,He started a countenance.
00:07:05,00:07:09,"His full name is Francis John Fein, Marmian Dimock."
00:07:09,00:07:14,"And as far as I can tell, as it's a hereditary title, he is the current Queen's Champion."
00:07:14,00:07:15,How does he look?
00:07:15,00:07:16,Like.
00:07:16,00:07:18,He just looks like a nice man.
00:07:18,00:07:21,You can't actually tell how he looks because he's wearing a full suit of armour at all
00:07:21,00:07:22,times.
00:07:22,00:07:23,What can it do?
00:07:23,00:07:26,Do we know he's the countenance office?
00:07:26,00:07:30,"Like, who challenges the Queen's right to rule?"
00:07:30,00:07:34,Because the one thing that did happen at the Queen's coronation dinner that hadn't happened
00:07:34,00:07:40,"before was that her mother, as she became the Queen mother, wouldn't let her have too much"
00:07:40,00:07:41,to drink.
00:07:41,00:07:43,"Remember, you have to reign all afternoon."
00:07:43,00:07:46,She didn't want her daughter getting drunk at the lunch.
00:07:46,00:07:48,"And also, of course, coronation chicken was invented for the occasion."
00:07:48,00:07:51,"That's where it gets its name, especially created early."
00:07:51,00:07:52,"Oh, though."
00:07:52,00:07:57,"It's very similar to Jubilee Chicken, which was invented a few years earlier for the"
00:07:57,00:07:58,Silver Jubilee of Joyce Afef.
00:07:58,00:07:59,How is it?
00:07:59,00:08:03,And which is basically chicken with mayonnaise and spices.
00:08:03,00:08:05,I'm pretty much exactly the same thing.
00:08:05,00:08:09,"But then they, let's say, reinvented it for the coronation."
00:08:09,00:08:11,So I always call it Jubilee Chicken when I go.
00:08:11,00:08:12,Oh.
00:08:12,00:08:17,"Can I have a Jubilee Chicken Panino, please?"
00:08:17,00:08:23,"Do you know that on that day when they dressed in, as TV sets, that's not the only thing that"
00:08:23,00:08:24,they dressed as?
00:08:24,00:08:25,No.
00:08:25,00:08:27,They dressed as Mount Everest as well.
00:08:27,00:08:28,Yeah.
00:08:28,00:08:29,"Well, it's been conquered the day before."
00:08:29,00:08:30,Exactly.
00:08:30,00:08:31,And the news had come through.
00:08:31,00:08:32,So they were celebrating a number of things.
00:08:32,00:08:35,And Mount Everest was a massive celebration.
00:08:35,00:08:37,So people would dress as TV sets and Mount Everest.
00:08:37,00:08:38,That's amazing.
00:08:38,00:08:39,Yeah.
00:08:39,00:08:41,What a big news day.
00:08:41,00:08:42,Yeah.
00:08:42,00:08:43,Everest and the coronation are the same day.
00:08:43,00:08:44,That's massive.
00:08:44,00:08:45,Yeah.
00:08:45,00:08:50,"Do you know there's a conspiracy that we didn't, that Hillary didn't get to the top of Mount"
00:08:50,00:08:51,Everest?
00:08:51,00:08:52,Really?
00:08:52,00:08:53,Yeah.
00:08:53,00:08:54,"And it's actually really interesting, the reason why."
00:08:54,00:08:59,And the way that the news got broken to the British public was via a journalist called James
00:08:59,00:09:04,"Morris, who has changed sex and is now Jan Morris, one of the most famous travel riders"
00:09:04,00:09:05,alive.
00:09:05,00:09:07,Now Jan Morris got the scoop.
00:09:07,00:09:12,"Was there when Hillary came down, when he said the words, ""We knocked the bastard off"
00:09:12,00:09:14,"George"" and got the scoop."
00:09:14,00:09:15,Now here was the thing.
00:09:15,00:09:19,"She didn't know how to get, or here at the time, didn't know how to get the message back"
00:09:19,00:09:23,without it being infiltrated and then spread around the world because he wanted the scoop.
00:09:23,00:09:27,So what he ended up sending was a coded message that he'd pre-arranged to be sent back.
00:09:27,00:09:29,And this was the message that actually went back.
00:09:29,00:09:32,"The message went, ""Snow conditions bad, stop."
00:09:32,00:09:34,Advanced base abandoned yesterday.
00:09:34,00:09:35,Stop.
00:09:35,00:09:36,"A waiting improvement."""
00:09:36,00:09:38,So the message was to say that they haven't made it.
00:09:38,00:09:39,Wow.
00:09:39,00:09:41,And people actually think that he was telling the truth there.
00:09:41,00:09:44,So what message did he send if they didn't make it then?
00:09:44,00:09:45,"Good news, everyone."
00:09:45,00:09:49,That's a good point.
00:09:49,00:09:50,Yeah.
00:09:50,00:09:55,"OK, time for fact number two."
00:09:55,00:09:57,And that is James.
00:09:57,00:10:03,"OK, my fact this week is that the world puddle jumping championships, bands, fizzy drinks,"
00:10:03,00:10:07,in case they improve participants' performance.
00:10:07,00:10:09,Talks through the science behind them.
00:10:09,00:10:13,"Well, it's weird because on QI, we have said that fizzy drinks don't make children more"
00:10:13,00:10:14,hyperactive.
00:10:14,00:10:17,"And in the world puddle jumping championships, it's usually children."
00:10:17,00:10:19,"In fact, it's always children taking part."
00:10:19,00:10:23,"But they think that if you give them fizzy drinks, then they will become more excitable, more"
00:10:23,00:10:28,"hyperactive, and it could enable them to jump higher and make bigger splashes than other"
00:10:28,00:10:29,competitors.
00:10:29,00:10:32,"And they don't want to encourage people to drink fizzy drinks, because it's not good for"
00:10:32,00:10:33,you.
00:10:33,00:10:34,And so they've decided to ban it.
00:10:34,00:10:36,I think that's very sweet.
00:10:36,00:10:39,Apart from the ban element of it.
00:10:39,00:10:41,"It could be a placebo thing, couldn't it, if you've heard your parents have written the"
00:10:41,00:10:44,"news that it makes you jump better, then that could have effect."
00:10:44,00:10:47,"Well, what we've said on QI, and I can't remember quite the science behind it, is that"
00:10:47,00:10:53,"the children actually act exactly the same, but it's the adults who then kind of fuss around"
00:10:53,00:10:55,"them and think, oh, they're hyperactive, they're hyperactive."
00:10:55,00:11:00,"And when you get someone who's watching the events happening, who doesn't know whether"
00:11:00,00:11:03,"or not they've had fizzy drinks, they can't tell the difference with the children."
00:11:03,00:11:04,"How do they monitor it, though?"
00:11:04,00:11:06,"Like, how do you test for fizzy drinking?"
00:11:06,00:11:09,Is it a P sample?
00:11:09,00:11:13,"I think they just ban them from the general area of the competition, so maybe you could"
00:11:13,00:11:18,"like, stock up on Red Bull the night before."
00:11:18,00:11:24,"I was reading the Metro newspaper, covered this, and the line they used was, this is not"
00:11:24,00:11:28,the first time sporting contest have been marred by doping associations.
00:11:28,00:11:33,Lance Armstrong was tripping seven.
00:11:33,00:11:38,"So what they do is it's based on height of jump, enthusiasm, distance of splash and stick"
00:11:38,00:11:44,"ability, which is the amount of mud, which clings to each competitor, all those different things."
00:11:44,00:11:48,"My favourite element of that is enthusiasm, it's being marred."
00:11:48,00:11:51,"That's basically code for, as with any event where you're giving prizes to kids, the one"
00:11:51,00:11:56,"that looks most likely to burst into tears if you don't win, yes, the win, because you just"
00:11:56,00:11:57,don't want a scene.
00:11:57,00:12:01,And it'd be good in the Olympics if the most enthusiastic competitors are living.
00:12:01,00:12:06,"In the Tarder France, they'll give it, whoever is the most aggressive on the day, they'll"
00:12:06,00:12:07,give a prize to even if they don't win.
00:12:07,00:12:08,Really?
00:12:08,00:12:09,Yeah.
00:12:09,00:12:14,"What someone who's like, kicked other bisonists off the track, aggression in this case means"
00:12:14,00:12:19,"that you're making attacks earlier and trying to, trying to be of the race on what?"
00:12:19,00:12:20,"Yeah, right."
00:12:20,00:12:21,Okay.
00:12:21,00:12:23,"The whole notion of jumping, to forget all this thing about cricket being in the Olympics,"
00:12:23,00:12:26,I want the campaign to put the standing long jump back into the Olympics.
00:12:26,00:12:27,The standing long jump.
00:12:27,00:12:30,"Because it used to be in until 1912, I think."
00:12:30,00:12:32,"And the record is still going, even though not in the Olympics."
00:12:32,00:12:36,"The record for the standing long jump was broken earlier this year, 23rd of February,"
00:12:36,00:12:42,"2015, the Dallas Cowboys cornerback did a standing long jump of 12 feet, two and three quarter"
00:12:42,00:12:45,"inches, which is the length of the snooker table from a standing."
00:12:45,00:12:49,But then the other bizarre thing about the standing long jump is that it is a condition
00:12:49,00:12:54,"of entry to serve in the Brazilian police, to serve in the Brazilian police."
00:12:54,00:12:57,"You have to do a stat, if you're a man, you need to be able to do a standing long jump"
00:12:57,00:13:02,"of 2.14 meters, if you're a woman, 1.66, there's no way I could do that."
00:13:02,00:13:03,That's great.
00:13:03,00:13:04,That's incredible.
00:13:04,00:13:05,I couldn't.
00:13:05,00:13:06,Should we do it?
00:13:06,00:13:08,And then say what our score is going to be.
00:13:08,00:13:09,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:13:09,00:13:10,"OK, we're going to do a quick cut here."
00:13:10,00:13:11,Yeah.
00:13:11,00:13:12,We do this for the morning.
00:13:12,00:13:13,Yeah.
00:13:13,00:13:14,Two meters.
00:13:14,00:13:15,Yeah.
00:13:15,00:13:16,That was really fun.
00:13:16,00:13:17,Right.
00:13:17,00:13:18,Anyway.
00:13:18,00:13:20,So we're still recording.
00:13:20,00:13:26,And we found out that Andy is the best at the standing long jump by about five centimeters.
00:13:26,00:13:27,Yeah.
00:13:27,00:13:28,I mean.
00:13:28,00:13:32,"And we all reckon we were getting around two meters, so we don't think we can get into"
00:13:32,00:13:33,the Brazilian.
00:13:33,00:13:35,But only by a few centimeters.
00:13:35,00:13:37,"So if we work on it, we might be able to do it."
00:13:37,00:13:39,Did we make it into the Brazilian ladies army?
00:13:39,00:13:40,"Yes, we did."
00:13:40,00:13:41,1.66.
00:13:41,00:13:42,Get in.
00:13:42,00:13:43,All right.
00:13:43,00:13:48,"OK, I want to do some things about drugs and performance enhancing drugs."
00:13:48,00:13:55,"So Peta Coda, who's a tennis player, he tested positive for the steroid Nandralone in"
00:13:55,00:14:01,"Wimbledon in 1998, but he blamed it on having eaten too much steroid fed veal."
00:14:01,00:14:02,OK.
00:14:02,00:14:07,"And it turned out that if he had eaten enough veal to be tested positive, he would have had"
00:14:07,00:14:13,to have eaten 40 calves a day for 20 years to have such high level.
00:14:13,00:14:18,"And there was an Olympic gold medalist called Dennis Mitchell, who tested positive for high"
00:14:18,00:14:19,testosterone.
00:14:19,00:14:24,And he claimed that it was because he consumed five beers the night before and had sex with
00:14:24,00:14:25,his wife four times.
00:14:25,00:14:26,That's ridiculous.
00:14:26,00:14:31,No one can have five beers.
00:14:31,00:14:37,"If I was the veal guy and I was being investigated, I like to think that I would have tried to prove"
00:14:37,00:14:38,that.
00:14:38,00:14:42,"And when the investigators are coming out, I would have ordered a load of calves and been constantly"
00:14:42,00:14:49,using a calf just all over my house and my garden full of calves.
00:14:49,00:14:54,"This park where they had this puddle-tumping thing, it's called Wixsteed Park, and Wixsteeds"
00:14:54,00:14:55,make playgrounds.
00:14:55,00:14:56,Yep.
00:14:56,00:14:57,Yeah.
00:14:57,00:14:58,"And did you hear about the guy, Charles Wixsteed?"
00:14:58,00:14:59,Yeah.
00:14:59,00:15:00,This is incredible.
00:15:00,00:15:02,"The best thing about the fact, I think."
00:15:02,00:15:05,He invented the slide and the swing.
00:15:05,00:15:06,Two things.
00:15:06,00:15:07,Two things.
00:15:07,00:15:08,Two things.
00:15:08,00:15:09,"That was a good morning, wasn't it?"
00:15:09,00:15:10,Yeah.
00:15:10,00:15:11,He invented the slide.
00:15:11,00:15:12,Give us more details.
00:15:12,00:15:15,"Well, people say that he invented the modern slide."
00:15:15,00:15:20,"Now, I have found a source which disputes this and points out there are a couple of earlier"
00:15:20,00:15:24,"things in New York, which look a lot like slides."
00:15:24,00:15:26,So it's possible that he didn't invent the very first slide.
00:15:26,00:15:32,He definitely came up with a version of it for his park and he also invented the modern
00:15:32,00:15:34,"swing, which you get in playgrounds."
00:15:34,00:15:36,"And his first version, have you seen it?"
00:15:36,00:15:37,No.
00:15:37,00:15:40,The top bar is almost four meters off the ground.
00:15:40,00:15:42,It looks incredibly dangerous.
00:15:42,00:15:43,Yeah.
00:15:43,00:15:44,There's photos that have been on Earth.
00:15:44,00:15:47,I don't know if you've ever seen the sort of extreme swinging.
00:15:47,00:15:48,It's kind of like that.
00:15:48,00:15:52,I think I've seen extreme swinging.
00:15:52,00:15:53,"Just Google that, anyone at home."
00:15:53,00:15:57,He didn't grow up in the suburbs and not...
00:15:57,00:16:01,But what he kind of also pioneered was the idea of the playground and this park where
00:16:01,00:16:06,the puddle jumping competition was held is the park where the first ever playground was
00:16:06,00:16:07,built.
00:16:07,00:16:10,"And he used pipes from World War I, Eddie, turned them into swings."
00:16:10,00:16:13,So they became the first swings and you can see the first slides as well.
00:16:13,00:16:14,They're really interesting.
00:16:14,00:16:19,"The first slides were polished planks of wood with no sides, you just went down a plank"
00:16:19,00:16:20,of wood.
00:16:20,00:16:21,Risking a broken leg and splinters.
00:16:21,00:16:25,"Yeah, and kids, you can see them going down it and it's just very dangerous."
00:16:25,00:16:29,"They were also gender segregated, one for boys and one for girls."
00:16:29,00:16:30,Yeah.
00:16:30,00:16:32,He said later on that was an old fashioned.
00:16:32,00:16:38,He realized that was an old fashioned notion and he abandoned that segregation.
00:16:38,00:16:41,And so they know where the oldest modern day swing then in the world is and it's not in
00:16:41,00:16:45,"the park, it's in the backyard of Charles Wixsteed's home, which they discovered not too"
00:16:45,00:16:48,long ago and it was his prototype.
00:16:48,00:16:53,"And so now that we know officially the oldest swing in the world is still working, it's still"
00:16:53,00:16:54,working.
00:16:54,00:17:01,"But no, it is not like an iPhone that goes out there."
00:17:01,00:17:05,"Okay, time for fact number three and that is Mark."
00:17:05,00:17:11,My fact is that the shuttlecocks used in professional badminton are made using real goose feathers
00:17:11,00:17:14,which are always taken from the birds left wing.
00:17:14,00:17:15,Wow.
00:17:15,00:17:20,"So I kind of knew that it was taken from an animal, I thought it was duck, I think ducks can"
00:17:20,00:17:21,be used in your defence.
00:17:21,00:17:22,Right.
00:17:22,00:17:25,I don't think that's the stupidest mistake anyone's ever made.
00:17:25,00:17:27,But I didn't know the left wing.
00:17:27,00:17:32,"Yeah, well apparently if they use, if you get them from the left wing, it makes the shuttle"
00:17:32,00:17:34,cock spin clockwise.
00:17:34,00:17:38,"If you turn them from the right wing, it makes the shuttle cock spin anti-clockwise."
00:17:38,00:17:42,And they're obviously used to playing with the clockwise spin and that's why they keep
00:17:42,00:17:43,using those wings.
00:17:43,00:17:47,"So if you have one which was half with feathers from the left wing and half from the right wing,"
00:17:47,00:17:48,would it not spin?
00:17:48,00:17:51,"It would go completely, yeah, it would be a completely haphazard."
00:17:51,00:17:52,Really?
00:17:52,00:17:53,Yeah.
00:17:53,00:17:57,"So if you took the feathers from a bird's right wing and you can put them on its left wing,"
00:17:57,00:17:58,so I had two left wings.
00:17:58,00:18:00,You'd be arrested.
00:18:00,00:18:04,"But you're right, they do take them from a live animal because animals will regrow them."
00:18:04,00:18:09,So I don't know if they keep harvesting the same bird to get more shuttlecocks out of it.
00:18:09,00:18:12,But it does apparently cause the birding to goose incredible pain when they're taken
00:18:12,00:18:13,out.
00:18:13,00:18:14,So you then regrow.
00:18:14,00:18:16,"You know when someone does, I don't know, your eyebrows?"
00:18:16,00:18:17,Yeah.
00:18:17,00:18:21,"That in itself is a bit like, oh, that's quite painful, imagine like at the bottom of feathers"
00:18:21,00:18:22,it's almost sticks.
00:18:22,00:18:27,"Well, I think it's more akin to pulling out toenails rather than hairs, isn't it?"
00:18:27,00:18:28,Damn it.
00:18:28,00:18:33,"I read this incredible fact which is if a bold eagle loses a feather on one of its wings,"
00:18:33,00:18:37,it will shed the corresponding feather on the opposite wing to maintain balance.
00:18:37,00:18:38,Now that.
00:18:38,00:18:39,Wow.
00:18:39,00:18:40,Isn't that amazing?
00:18:40,00:18:44,You're fundamentally Christians will pick up on to show that there is a god that's just
00:18:44,00:18:45,"astonishing, isn't it?"
00:18:45,00:18:46,Wow.
00:18:46,00:18:47,How quickly would it do it?
00:18:47,00:18:48,I reckon just straight away.
00:18:48,00:18:51,"So if you were, if you happen to be plucking a bold eagle and you took one out, you'd just"
00:18:51,00:18:54,"see another one go, on the other side."
00:18:54,00:18:57,That would be useful if you're like a turkey plucker or something and you'd only have to
00:18:57,00:18:58,do half the turkey.
00:18:58,00:18:59,Yeah.
00:18:59,00:19:03,"Do they pluck it out their own feather or do they, can they selectively shed a single"
00:19:03,00:19:04,feather?
00:19:04,00:19:05,I believe that's what I read.
00:19:05,00:19:10,"Now I, I actually don't believe it myself, but that's what I read in a reputable source."
00:19:10,00:19:11,I read it.
00:19:11,00:19:12,I read it.
00:19:12,00:19:13,I read it.
00:19:13,00:19:14,I think that's what I read.
00:19:14,00:19:18,"This is where Dan's cheekly boyish grin is causing it, easy winding us up here, but no,"
00:19:18,00:19:19,that's what I read.
00:19:19,00:19:23,It's no more than four feathers from the same goose for the same shuttlecock.
00:19:23,00:19:26,"I've heard that once they had a feather on it, they'd have a feather on it and they'd"
00:19:26,00:19:27,have a feather on it.
00:19:27,00:19:28,I think that's what I read.
00:19:28,00:19:29,"This is where Dan's cheeky boyish grin is causing it easy winding us up here, but"
00:19:29,00:19:30,"no, that's what I read."
00:19:30,00:19:31,It's no more than four feathers from the same goose for the same shuttlecock.
00:19:31,00:19:32,I've heard that once they had a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd
00:19:32,00:19:59,have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd
00:19:59,00:20:09,have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it.
00:20:09,00:20:35,I've heard that once they had a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd
00:20:35,00:21:01,have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and
00:21:01,00:21:10,they'd have a feather on it.
00:21:10,00:21:28,It's a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and
00:21:28,00:21:44,they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it and they'd have a feather on it

00:26:52,00:27:07,"if we have a 2,000 year old jar of honey and a modern day jar of honey you can have the 2,000 year old one"
00:27:07,00:27:13,it's such a ridiculous thing and porn is the anyone involved in making it knows it's the most unerotic thing that you're doing with a film
00:27:13,00:27:18,and famously and don't look now when Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie were supposed to have done it for real
00:27:18,00:27:26,when the love scene Donald Sutherland says if you've had a film crew around you you'll know how unerotic it is and how difficult it would be to do it
00:27:26,00:27:31,but the notion of the fluffer I found out recently apparently it's a myth that the fluffer exists at all
00:27:31,00:27:41,the fluffer does we don't know the fluffer is and I guess it's normally a woman who's paid to ready the man for his performance to get him into a physical state where he's ready to perform
00:27:41,00:27:47,and that's just a complete myth if you're a male porn performer you're expected to be ready and if you're not ready then you won't get the job
00:27:47,00:27:54,and also I love the fact that the people who clean the London Underground lines overnight when the tubes shut overnight they're called fluffers as well
00:27:54,00:27:58,so I think there is only one true job called a fluffer and it's the one that clean the tube
00:27:58,00:28:04,oh imagine your disappointment when you find out when you applied for fluffer you're down in the London Underground
00:28:04,00:28:14,I found another Egyptian book that has been sort of a mysterious book that we haven't quite cracked and decoded
00:28:14,00:28:20,and they've recently they think they've managed to decode it properly and this is Macquarie University in Australia
00:28:20,00:28:24,I think they've managed to do it and it's a thousand three hundred years old this text
00:28:24,00:28:27,and they think what it turns out to be is that it's a book of spells
00:28:27,00:28:33,some of the spells that they've translated include a spell for someone who is possessed
00:28:33,00:28:39,someone who is annoyed at you as a spell for that that a woman might conceive
00:28:39,00:28:46,and when someone has a magic on them you've got a magic on you
00:28:46,00:28:50,and I like that though this is someone who's annoyed at you
00:28:50,00:28:52,I think that's a fantastic spell
00:28:52,00:28:55,and you can just do a magic on them and they'll not be annoyed with you
00:28:55,00:28:57,exactly that's great
00:28:57,00:29:00,there's another one called the Greek Magical Papyrus
00:29:00,00:29:07,and that gives you explanations for ingredients in other magics as you might call them
00:29:07,00:29:11,so if a magic spell asks for a head of a snake it's actually a leech
00:29:11,00:29:14,and if it asks for crocodile dung it's Egyptian earth
00:29:14,00:29:19,and if it asks for lion's semen you should use human semen
00:29:19,00:29:21,but for the magical spells
00:29:21,00:29:27,so people often thought that these magic spells that they were doing had like the head of a snake in or lion's semen in
00:29:27,00:29:30,but actually they were much more normal objects
00:29:30,00:29:33,thinking back in those days who would want the job of collecting the lion's semen
00:29:33,00:29:36,you know I mean now they do it straight from the testicle I think
00:29:36,00:29:38,I know they knock it out and collect it
00:29:38,00:29:41,no I think the lions have a fluffer don't they?
00:29:41,00:29:46,isn't there a thought that the idea of them changing the words or changing
00:29:46,00:29:49,the terms is almost the copyright of its day
00:29:49,00:29:54,it was to it was the secret ingredient to Coca-Cola type things
00:29:54,00:29:56,is it yeah that's why I read with Babylonian semen
00:29:56,00:29:59,the secret ingredient of Coca-Cola
00:29:59,00:30:05,for legal reasons I think you have to say that lion's semen
00:30:05,00:30:08,I think they found that from Babylonian tunaeiform
00:30:08,00:30:11,that they thought that they were like look at all these odd ingredients
00:30:11,00:30:15,and they realized that they were coded words kind of like the Jan Morris code from Everest
00:30:15,00:30:20,so that no one could steal the proper incantation and the ingredients for us
00:30:20,00:30:23,this is just quite interesting next year playboy
00:30:23,00:30:26,no more nude women in playboy they're getting rid of
00:30:26,00:30:30,so it's all going to be sort of tasteful tasteful in quotation marks
00:30:30,00:30:31,what they think is tasteful
00:30:31,00:30:34,for you always say that you read that for the articles down don't you?
00:30:34,00:30:37,no I collect old ones because yeah Hunter S. Thompson used to write for them
00:30:37,00:30:42,Woody Allen and Grapchow Marx and yeah extraordinary comic articles in there
00:30:42,00:30:45,and now I can read it again for the articles
