00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish. Before we get going, we just want to let you know we have a very, very exciting guest across the pond, an international sensation.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Someone that if you are a follower of great science and comedy over in America is going to be a household name to you. It is the brilliant Hank Green.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Hank is someone that we have been following for years and years. We watch his videos. He's very much a fish vibe and we've wanted him on for about nine years and finally the moment happened and he managed to come on and it was so much fun to speak to him.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 He himself has a podcast that I highly recommend you listen to, if you haven't heard it yet, called SciShow Tangents. Very fishy as well. It's him and his two friends, Seri Riley and Sam Schultz, and what they do is each week they try and just one up each other and amaze each other with weird, funny research and it's fun and facts.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 So do give it a go and I'm actually going to be on it in a month or so. I don't know the scheduling of it, but yeah, I'm going to be fighting facts with Hank Green and Seri and Sam.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 So do give it a go, check it out, check out his books as well. His novels are absolutely amazing and of course he does all the stuff with his brother, John. You've got to check that out as well if you haven't heard it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 He's just one of those polymaths of nerd comedy. So give him a go. We really hope you enjoy the show. One quick thing to mention, if you're listening to us on a platform where you haven't followed us, please can you press the follow button.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 It really helps us to bump up the charts. Do that with SciShow Tangents as well. Give them a follow and otherwise enjoy Hank Green on no such thing as a fish. Here we go. On with the show.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:55.000

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations around the world.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Hank Green and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Starting with fact number one, that is Hank.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 My fact is the cactivic number system created by an UP at school children based on their languages system of counting makes math easier.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Brilliant.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 How so?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 I should say to start, it would make math much harder if you were you, unfortunately.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Was that specifically me, Hank?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Well, I'm just guessing that you use a base 10 number system and so converting constantly between base 10 and base 20 would be very difficult.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 So Dan and the rest of us, we count in base 10, so that means that if you've got a number, say let's say 123, the number three at the end is three units, the number two is two tens and number one is one hundreds, right?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Right.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 And in base 20, we've got it so the third number again is the number of units, but then the second number would be the number of 20s in a number and the first number would be the number of four hundreds, which is 20 times 20.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 So, like for instance, 123 in a base 20 would be one, the three is the same, and then two would be two times 20, which is 40, and then the one would be one times four hundred, which is four hundreds.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 So 123 would actually equate to four hundred and forty three.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Is that right?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Yeah.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 What I really like about this counting system is it was created, is this right for a school project in 1994?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Yeah.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 So they had a system of counting.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 It would be basically one, two, three, four, five, and then five, one, five, two, five, three, five, four, five, etc.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 And then once you got to 20, they would start over again with it.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 So it's like the base 20 system with a sub-base of five.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 So it's like two different bases in the counting system that the people there used, but they created the number system as a class project.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 The teacher was like, okay, like you have a counting system, but it doesn't have numbers.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 So let's create the number system.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 And it's the first number system created in the Western hemisphere in like a hundred years.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 That's cool.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 And every number is actually composed of strokes that represent that number.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 So one is one stroke, two is a V, two strokes, three is like a backwards N, three, and then, and four is like a W.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 And then, oh my God, this is so cool and weird.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 You strike on the top, and that's five.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 So five with nothing under it is five.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 And then five with one stroke beneath it is six.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 The five stroke with two strokes beneath it is seven, etc.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 And then when you get to the next five, you do two strokes at the top.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 That represents 10.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 And then you add more strokes to the bottom until you get up to 20.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 And then you start over at one and zero.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 And that means that when you look at them, first of all, it's representing exactly what the number is.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 But like that becomes very, you know, innate with anything like we know that four means four,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 even though four doesn't really look like four.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 But you can actually just, if you want to subtract or add, you just take the shape away that you're trying to subtract.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 So if you've got a seven and you want to take away three, you look and the three is in the seven and you take the three away.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 That's very cool.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Wow.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Is it being used now?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 Has it been adopted for anything?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Yeah.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 So it's spread across a lot of native Alaska communities because they had this counting system and having number systems for it was good.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 But then, and so it spread pretty, pretty quickly and pretty far.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 And actually the math scores for those areas went up to above average for the U.S.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 But then you started to get things like that, like, you know, school funding based on performance on assessment tests.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And that was going to be based in a base 10 system.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 It's going to be based with Arabic numerals.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 And so the school stopped teaching it except in like specifically in UP at language classes.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 And also like you can't type them into a calculator or a computer.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 But then recently, like within the last few weeks, it was announced that Unicode is actually going to be putting these numbers into its system.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 So you will be able to use in UP characters in computers and build calculators that use them and function.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Very cool.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 God, it's incredible.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Very cool.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Do they have any ownership over this kind of new system like these kids?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Are they going to be the next Bezos and Musk?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 Absolutely.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Coining it in.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 This happened in the 90s when this like classroom sort of developed the number system and then, you know, kind of got started spreading around.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 And so now those school children are, I assume, my age, because I was in high school in the 90s.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 And I do not know where the actual kids are who helped develop this.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 That's amazing.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 They're all in Silicon Valley.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 It'd be weird to have like a royalty on a number system, but I'm for it.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 I'm like, yes, please.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 It was so good.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 I find it amazing when you read about kids who notice something that, I guess it's just that thing of, oh, it's a kid noticing it over an adult.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Who works in this area.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 There was, I haven't actually researched this.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 It's just the memory of there's a kid.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 I think he was a teenage, late teens who, when he was being taught stuff from Newton's principia, he discovered a mistake.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 No one had seen it.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Just he's correcting Newton, which is an astonishing thing to do.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 And they all looked at it and were, oh, yeah, that's completely wrong.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Or I was reading about, have you heard about the Futurama theorem?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 No.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 So this is, years ago, I went out for dinner in London with a few of the Simpsons writers, a guy called Al Jean and a few other people who,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 they were in town because there's a great scientist here, mathematician called Simon Singh, who is a,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 he wrote a book because he noticed that there was lots of mathematics inside Simpsons episodes.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 And it turns out, all the head writers of the Simpsons are all math geeks. They all went to Harvard and they all are like written papers and so on.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 And so a lot of Simpsons episodes, there's hidden equations and, you know, formats, last theorem and stuff.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 And I'm presuming you're not referring to the bit where Bart needs to escape a lion cage.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 And he works out the Roman numeral for seven by adding Rocky five and Rocky two together.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 Are you saying something even more complicated than that?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 It's just a bit, it's a very good gag, that one.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 But there was a, there was an episode of Futurama.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 So it was the writers of the Simpsons who went over to that where they had to solve a problem, which was, it was an episode called The Prisoner of Bender.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 And a guy called Ken Keeler needed to have a thing where he was talking about the idea of minds being swapped into other people.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 And how could you get the mind back into someone if the mind could only travel once?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 It was quite a complicated thing. And he worked out by adding two extra people, no matter how many people were having their brain swapped,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 would mean that all the brains could return to the original person, all the memories could go back to the original person.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 And that was a new development in mathematics. It's called the Futurama theorem.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Wow.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 That's its own thing now. Yeah.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 So they had to create it to solve a plot problem within the cartoon.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 That is really cool.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 I have a, I have a thing I'd like to bring up about this because I saw people talking about it because this Unicode news is new.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 And because this is like countable, like you can actually count the strokes.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 People were saying, well, that's also true of Arabic numerals. You just count the angles.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 So with, with, you know, four, there's like, you know, dot, dot, dot, dot, basically.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 And with seven, that can be seven angles in a seven, right?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 But if you put the stroke in the middle, then you can make it so that it counts up to seven.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 And this has been a myth for a long time that it was created like that way intentionally.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 This is a way that you can do, like use Arabic numerals and you can like count angles and like basically make an eight in a certain way where it has eight angles.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 But that's not a thing that like, I see people saying all the time that this is like an intentional thing.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 And it was like, how Arabic numerals happened is not people were making weird squiggles and they were representative of something at some point.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 And then people forgot what they were representative of.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 And just we're like, yeah, that, that means it's called light letters, I guess the same, right?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Yeah, just starting out with shapes, Mandarin.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 I speak a bit of Mandarin from my childhood.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 And so the counting, when you write out the counting one to 10, one is a stroke of one, two is a stroke of two, three strokes of it.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 And then they just give up.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 They just let it just, yeah, six is something one, two, three, four, seven is two, two strokes, eight, two strokes.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Yeah, they do so well.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 But you've got to give up at some point with that system.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Yeah, we have the opposite of that where most of our greater than 10 numbers have a system, you know, like 21, 35.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 But 11 and 12 are just like, I don't know.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Yeah, we're just going to be different.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 We want to be crazy and then you can get to 13, 14, 15.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 But I want to be 11.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 I was reading about 11 and 12.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 I was reading about it's kind of 12th.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 It's all about if you take 10 away from those numbers.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 So 12 comes from 12th and that means two left.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 Oh, does it?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 If you take 10 away, you have two left.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Well, where the heck does 11 come from then?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 It's an even more tortured etymology, I think, but it's basically one left if you take 10 away.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 But I can't remember why you're taking 10 away.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 Yeah.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 Yeah.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 You know, Hank, I have a question for you because you seem to know a lot about this, right?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 So the base 10, is it because we have 10 fingers?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 We think that's why we counted base 10.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 So the cactivic number system, are we thinking that they counted with their toes as well?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 I think that that is correct.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 I think that's basically the case.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 How interesting.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 And there were also, I don't know if it was Babylonian, but like one original number system is base 60,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 we still have for degrees and we have it for minutes, like it sticks around in weird places.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 I wonder what they did, because there are some base 12 numbering systems.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 There's not that many, but there's like, I think there's one in like Nepal and some in Africa and stuff.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 And I think the idea of that is you count between your fingers, right?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Yeah.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 It's like the little dip in between each finger counts as one.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Yeah.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 What I want to believe is that they recognize that it was better because base 12 is better.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 It's just better.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Is it?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 Like that's why we use base 12 because we have one in two dozen.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 Like that's a base 12 way of counting kind of.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 And because it's more divisible by more things.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 And that's why we keep using dozens is because you can divide it up more easily and make different better shapes out of it when you're shipping stuff around.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 That's interesting.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 Okay.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 In ancient China, sorry, in ancient Japan, Dan, you were talking about how.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 It was in China.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 In Chinese, you had the lines.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 In Mandarin, yeah.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 In Mandarin, yeah.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 So in ancient Japan, they used to actually use sticks to count with.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 And in the same way we might use a calculator or whatever, you would use actual sticks.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 So you would do one, two, three, four, and then you would take them away or add them or whatever.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 And then they came up with the zero because zero isn't a natural thing.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Like most number systems don't have a zero to start off with.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 And then they work out that they need it in order to do like tens, hundreds and thousands and stuff like that.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 And so they started using a go stone.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 So a stone from the game go as a zero.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 And then as soon as they worked out that they could have a zero, they started being able to use abacuses, which had come over from China.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 And they stopped using these sticks almost overnight.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 And you can see all this writing of these teenagers who say our parents are using these sticks to do all this counting.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 We can't work out how it works.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 We have no idea what's going on.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 We use abacuses because obviously that's the best way of doing it.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 We have no idea what they're doing.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 Yeah, it's like new math.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Like Common Core comes out in the U.S.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 And suddenly the parents are like, what are these kids with their beads?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Yeah.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 What are they doing?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 They're filling up a whole piece of paper to divide 12 by 2.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 It's so confused.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 You know how if you count to a million and you count a number of second, it takes about 11 days.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 And if you count to a billion, it takes 30 years.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Right.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 There is someone who's counted to a million.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 I think he might be the first person ever to count to a million.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 He's an Alabama man called Jeremy Harper.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 So Hank, one of your countrymen.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Uh-huh.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Counted to a million.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 It took him 89 days.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 But he managed.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Wow.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 That seems doable.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 It's doable.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 You sort of write it down when you go to sleep and then you wake up and you're like, let's start up again.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 Oh, God.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 He did write it down.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 But if you're going to take sleep breaks, you might as well take other breaks.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 You might as well, like, I could count to a million over 30 years.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 Would that count?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Also, once you've got to a million, do you feel bad stopping?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 Yeah.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Yeah.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 You've got to carry on at that point.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 You've got to carry on.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 You ever wake up in the morning and he's like, well, a million and one.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 A million and two.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 A million and three.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 A million and I could.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 And also, like, was he doing it out?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Like, was he actually saying the words or was he doing it in his head?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 No, he was, oh, James, he was definitely, anyone could say they counted to a million in their head.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 But he was streaming.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 He was live streaming the entire process.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Some poor wife sitting at home going, fuck, I have to listen to this all of it.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 I remember there was a period in the early 2000s around 2000 and like, no, it's not quite

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 early, but like 2007 where counting to a million became a thing.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 I had two friends who were racing each other to count to a million.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 And that was really annoying.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 We'd be at the pub and they're just counting out loud and one's like a thousand ahead and

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 I'm trying to have a chat.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 And I can't even remember where they got up to.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 I think we just all stopped being friends.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 It really got in the way.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 That sounds like the right decision.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Dan, if he made a mistake, did he have to go back to the start?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 Because I think under the pressure of just counting, I reckon I'd make mistakes.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Yeah.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 I reckon I'd go from 111 to 119 by accident.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 Yeah.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 Yeah.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Well, you would have loved the pub chat there, James.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 I mean, I can't count a hundred dollars without starting over.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Okay.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 It is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 My fact is some people can control their own goose bumps.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 That kind of gave me goose bumps.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 That's amazing.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Maybe.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 Like I got some tingles in the back of my head.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 Well, there's a 1 in 1500 chance you are one of the chosen ones.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 I'm not.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 It's called VGP voluntarily generated pillow erection and the pillow erection is the

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 term for getting goose bumps.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 It's got to be a better term.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 No sniggering in the back.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 I imagine what is the, what's the prefix Pico mean Hank?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 That means very small, right?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 Little, tiny.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 Yeah.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 So you don't want to get your Pico erection mixed up with your Pico erection.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 Yeah.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 So this, so normally you get goose bumps when you're cold or you're watching an exciting

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 movie or you're having a big emotion, you know, there are a few, few different things.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 Yeah.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 I've seen this episode of Taskmaster.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 Yeah.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 And obviously it's, it's, well, not obviously really, but what happens is your body is trying

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 to raise your hairs on end to the hairs, the sort of remains of the hairs that were once

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 thick and all over our bodies to create a fluffy layer all over you.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Yeah.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 And he's sorry, just still thick on Dan's case.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 That's what I'm thinking.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 I've, I've not progressed from the ancient man.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 And you actually do get warmer.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Do you get slightly warmer if you get goose bumps?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 He gets much bigger.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 I get way bigger.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 Yeah.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 I inflate.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 It's, um, no, that's, I mean, the, the, the wording of that, I read that as well.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 I always make it sound as if a predator's coming, you get scared, you go like a dried

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 dog.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 And yeah, I don't, I don't see that being an intimidating size difference to a human.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 But it makes a big difference.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 I mean, it's, it's a bigger difference when it's a tiny bird, for example, fluffing up

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 its feathers, you know, that is more.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 It makes a difference in a cat as well.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 Like when my cat's been fighting outside one of the other cats, she comes back and she's

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 really fluffy.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 She's probably big.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 Yeah.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Does your cat fight James?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Yeah.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 She's a northern cat.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 Yeah.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 Northern cat.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.500
 I don't, James, I don't mean to cast dispersions, but she looks like the most pampered house

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.500
 cat.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.500
 I didn't, I can't believe she goes outside.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.500
 Yeah.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.500
 Well, you should hear what she says about you.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:03.000
 I won't come around if I were you.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 Wow.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 Oh, we're learning.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 So anyway, sorry.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 There are these.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.520
 So you've got the, God, you've got the follicles all over you and they have, every follicle

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:18.360
 has a little nerve in it, which is connected to a tiny muscle, which can contract and haul

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.480
 the hair up on end.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:24.280
 So that normally happens if you're cold and you can give yourself goosebumps if you think

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.680
 of, you know, a big emotional occasion or thinking of fingernails down a blackboard,

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.480
 that's slightly different to what the 1 in 1500 people with VGP can do.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.320
 They don't think about something else to give themselves goosebumps.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.120
 They just, they just get it.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.480
 How do you know though, are they in an MRI machine when they do it?

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.480
 Because maybe they're just good at thinking about blackboards.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.480
 Yeah.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.480
 This seems to be going on trust, doesn't it?

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.480
 Yeah.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.120
 The article that you sent around Andy, there's the person who's the case study that they're

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.120
 talking to called Travis Carrasco.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.240
 And he just sits back and forth, like moving his head back and forth and like, and his

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.600
 parents will be like, what are you doing?

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.600
 And he's saying, I'm giving myself goosebumps.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.560
 And so that's, that's how he does it.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.040
 But what's, what's really interesting.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.040
 He's a mechanical engineer.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.040
 Oh, he's not a child.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.040
 No.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.040
 He's 29.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.800
 He's 29, a mechanical engineer from Las Vegas.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.480
 And the article starts by saying, he's a normal individual.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:26.040
 He loves coloring with colored pencils, likes leaderships books, and the color green.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.640
 That's, that's his description.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.640
 That's not normal.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.640
 That's bad profile writing.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.960
 Could you not find something more normal about this man?

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.960
 Yeah.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.000
 Is there anything else he can give me?

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Anything else?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.560
 Like, colored pencils is my thing.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:40.560
 Leadership books.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.440
 There's not much of a superhero thing, is it, Dan, really?

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.920
 Like, you know, if you turn up at the X-Man Academy and say that this is what I can do.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.920
 Well, it kind of is.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.920
 Yeah.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.920
 Yeah.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.920
 Yeah.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.920
 It's supposed to be autonomic.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.560
 Like, it's like being able to decide that your heart breathes or breathes.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.560
 Heart beats faster.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.800
 If you decide to make your heart breathe, that is a problem.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.800
 Yeah.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:08.240
 I saw recently a study from the University of Padua, and they found that the neurons

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:13.960
 which fire in your brain when you get goosebumps, so it's not a deliberate thing, but there

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.360
 are neurons firing.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.760
 The ones that fire are the same ones as make your nipples erect.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.760
 Yeah.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:20.760
 That makes sense.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.760
 So that's interesting, isn't it?

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.200
 It's like, it's the biggest of the goosebumps.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.200
 Yeah.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:31.000
 I wonder if these one in 1500 people can also make their nipples erect at will.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 Wow.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 You can make that a skill.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 What a skill.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Good question.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 Travis!

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.360
 I have a question about your nipples.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:43.400
 Put down those coloring pencils.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.400
 I think it was Travis.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.920
 It might have been another person talking about it, but so when they're getting the

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.800
 rocking feeling, he said the goosebumps will start on the back of his head, the back of

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.800
 his neck.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.200
 So, sorry, the bottom of his head, the bottom of his neck, and his bottom.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.200
 So it's this.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.200
 Oh.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.200
 Yeah.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.020
 I've never thought about goosebumps on my butt.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.020
 Exactly.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:11.520
 I've never thought about goosebumps, but apparently that's where he can get it, and then it kind

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.400
 of just envelopes his whole body.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.480
 Envelopes, you mean?

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.360
 No, no, envelopes.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.280
 Do geese have goosebumps?

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.360
 No.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.360
 They don't.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.120
 They don't get them, I believe, because they've got feathers.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:33.720
 I don't think they have the muscles connected to the, if you pluck a dead goose, or a live

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:40.560
 goose, then it'll have a kind of puckered, but actually, they should be called chimpanzee

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.240
 bumps or cat bumps or something.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.240
 Or human bumps.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.960
 I mean bumps, yeah.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.960
 Just call them bumps.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.640
 Well, they should be called pilo erections, clearly.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.560
 The OED says that goose bumps is an American word, and British people have either goose

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.080
 flesh, hen flesh, or goose skin.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.840
 Oh, because I thought the American was goose pimples.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.840
 Yeah.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:08.080
 I thought goose flesh is quite an old-fashioned, you get that in an old novel, maybe.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:13.240
 I definitely see why you guys are slowly switching over to ours, because goose flesh

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.240
 is gross.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.480
 Another one you can have is ancerine skin, which I really like, and ancerine means like

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.260
 a goose.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.940
 Like bovine is like a cow, ancerine is like a goose.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.120
 It's good to have that word just in case.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.800
 Darwin was really interested in goose bumps.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.600
 Darwin wanted to see, particularly on animals, what it was, like what was this thing that

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.800
 was happening to them.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:42.760
 And so he used to go to zoos, and he used to investigate goose bumps by bringing a stuffed

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:48.280
 snake with him and just chucking it at animals and giving them this sensation of fear, and

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.640
 then he would just note down.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:55.980
 This is a man who really doesn't want to finish his book.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:00.180
 Yeah, no, he loved pylorection.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:05.340
 He was very into it, and he would constantly be looking at it, and he could see it in dogs

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.060
 and baboons and parrots.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.060
 I mean, it's great.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.700
 I wish, there needs to be more talk about Darwin's sort of like, you know, how he used

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:17.460
 to play, what was it, bassoon to his plants and stuff like that.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:23.640
 There was a team of scientists in Korea, and in 2015 they developed, I think, which was

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.680
 a goose bump detector.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.320
 So this is very cool.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.120
 It's this tiny patch that you can stick on your skin, and it was developed by a professor

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:38.920
 Young Ho Cho, and he was watching a reality TV show, a music survival reality show, and

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.320
 he wondered if you could calculate people's emotional response.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:47.280
 So when people say, "I'm getting chills listening to this," you can assess the truthfulness

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.280
 of that statement.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.820
 Are they really multiplying, is the question.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:51.820
 Yeah.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:52.820
 Are you really losing control?

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:53.820
 Got a shave on?

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.820
 Yeah.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:25:00.740
 There's a guy called Thatcher Keltner at the University of California, and he uses this

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:06.500
 system to measure people's goose bumps, and he calls himself an awe scientist, so he checks

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.020
 out when things are awesome.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.500
 So Californian.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.500
 That's good.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:16.260
 They found that if you make someone look at like a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton or a huge

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:23.740
 tree or something really amazing, then you sign your name smaller, and the reason being

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:28.660
 that you kind of think of how amazing the world is and how small you are in proportion

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.660
 to it.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.660
 No.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:31.660
 And you sign your name smaller.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:32.660
 Wow.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.660
 Isn't that amazing?

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.660
 Oh man.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:35.660
 Yeah, I've never noticed that.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.660
 Yeah, I'm going to write my name next time near a big tree.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.260
 That is a very Californian thing.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.280
 Which bit of America are you in, Hank?

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.280
 Montana.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.280
 Oh, okay.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.060
 California, but not culturally.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.060
 Okay.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.060
 Got it.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.180
 It just, it feels like, you know, in California, that's the way you get grants.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:26:00.240
 You say, "Well, I'm studying how rad things are and how sweet these waves are."

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.500
 My favorite goose bumps of all, of course, are the ones in print by R.L.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.500
 Stein.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.900
 Oh, wonderful series of books.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.700
 Something really interesting is that I was watching an interview with him last night,

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.320
 and I just went down a little R.L.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.320
 Stein rabbit hole.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.920
 Well, what a career that guy had.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.640
 He started writing the goosebumps books when he was in his 40s.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.040
 He was like 46, I think, when he started.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.440
 Prior to that, he wrote like computer joke books.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.440
 He did novelizations of, you know the movie Spaceballs?

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.440
 Mel Brooks' movie?

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.440
 Yeah.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.640
 He did the novelization of Spaceballs.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.640
 So he had this whole other career.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.760
 I think the novel is better than the film in that case, isn't it?

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.880
 Everyone reads the novelizations of comedy films.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.300
 There are actually some people who can consciously give themselves Spaceballs.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.820
 So that's another one.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:53.140
 He was saying just within the goosebumps books, he says, "They're not really scary.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.260
 I could have made them really scary, but I keep real life out.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.620
 That's what's really scary."

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.660
 So he says, "There's no divorce, no divorced parents in goosebumps.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.740
 There's no child abuse, there's no real-world life.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.740
 It's fantasy.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.580
 The scare is a kind of subtle scare."

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.580
 They are scary.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.960
 Well, I've read more than my fair share of goosebumps when I was a small boy and they

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.960
 were terrifying.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.200
 Yeah, but you didn't read that one where the whole story is just two parents going through

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.080
 a messy divorce, did you?

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.480
 That's real scariness.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.840
 I think it turns out he was wrong.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.200
 He has put it in and not realized it, but that was his ambition.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.200
 Okay.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.280
 You said that he wrote them, he started writing them in his 40s.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.400
 I think he kind of almost finished writing them in his 40s, right?

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.460
 Because he wrote 62 books in five years.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.460
 It's insane.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.160
 He was pumping out one a month, I think.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.160
 Oh my God.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.260
 He said that he could write them in six days, one of these books.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.260
 It's incredible.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.120
 That's the good life.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.020
 The opposite of Darwin.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.640
 Can I tell you one more thing about skin?

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.640
 Oh yeah.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.640
 Yes, please.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.640
 Skin in general.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.640
 I love skin.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.640
 Yeah.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.640
 So this is really interesting.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:06.620
 Growing skin is really difficult because actually growing skin flat is easy, but then

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:11.200
 if you're grafting skin that you have artificially made, it's very hard to stitch it around

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.900
 the body part because we're not flat.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.080
 So this year, this is very exciting.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:21.920
 Scientists at Columbia University, they've worked out how to grow skin in very complicated

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.080
 shapes.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:29.840
 So one of the first things they did, they've made a hand made of skin.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.840
 I know.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.840
 And you can just swap it on.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:37.840
 Can I just ask, sorry, because I can see your hands now, but I can't tell whether or not

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.920
 you're wearing one of these skin gloves.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.000
 I'm wearing a whole skin me, actually.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.780
 I'm in a full body suit of my skin.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:48.780
 Sounds comfy.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.840
 Yeah, but it's genuinely very exciting.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:57.040
 They scan the hat, let's say I need a full hand, so I've burned all the skin on my hand.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:02.360
 They can scan your hand, they make a model of it, they grow the skin on that scaffold,

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.640
 and they remove it from the mold, and they can just put it on for the surgery.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.880
 And I just love this so much.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.160
 They tested this, they haven't done a human trial yet.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.580
 They tested this by grafting skin onto mice.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.080
 With human hands on a mouse?

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.040
 Yeah, just a giant human hand sticking off the face.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.720
 No, it's better, it's better than that.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:29.440
 They put, I think, a pair of human skin shorts on the back end of the mice.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.440
 What?

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.440
 Yeah.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.440
 I know.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.440
 Oh, wow.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.440
 Would a mouse wear human skin pants like this or like this?

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:47.880
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:53.200
 My fact this week is that early ideas for communicating with extraterrestrials included

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:58.200
 digging massive holes in the Saharan Desert, filling them with oil, and lighting them every

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.320
 night so that passing aliens could see it.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:07.760
 Also building a mirror so large it could send a beam of light to Mars to burn ridden messages

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.840
 into the ground for the Martians to read.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:17.560
 For the Martians to read and not like feel as if they are being lasered from space.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:24.200
 Yeah, imagine if like a huge laser came down from space and just burnt a massive hole in

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:28.240
 the earth and then everyone's screaming and someone goes, "Oh, wait a minute, it says

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.240
 hi."

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.240
 Yeah, it's one of the smiley faces.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.480
 And just by chance the Martians speak and read English.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.480
 It's great.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.240
 Yeah, there wasn't great thinking behind it.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.320
 This is a fact, by the way, that I found in probably my favorite pop science book that

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.960
 I've read in a very long time.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.080
 It's called "Is Anyone Out There?"

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:51.000
 And it's by the late great, he only died last year, it's so upsetting, Frank Drake, who

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 people might know from Drake's equation.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 He was very much a part of the greatest push for searching for ET.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.040
 He's the founder of SETI along with Carl Sagan and numerous other scientists.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:07.640
 And a lot of people for a very long time, up until quite recent, thought that there probably

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.760
 was Martian cities and that there were Martians living there and we couldn't quite see them.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:17.160
 So plans have been as big as building a mirror that can beam a laser down to burn into the

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:23.120
 ground all the way through to sort of almost crowd-funder things to raise money to cover

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:28.520
 the entire Eiffel Tower and mirrors so that every night at sunset, as the light was beaming

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.680
 off it, it could be bounced in the direction of Mars.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.000
 Just to let them know, we know you're there and we're just trying to say hi.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 Wow.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.920
 I suppose rather than putting words, a lot of them thought we would put, like, you know,

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.040
 a right-angle triangle or, you know, something that people would recognize.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.040
 It's a math thing.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.040
 Yeah.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.040
 Prime numbers.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.760
 But the aliens would go, "Ah, these guys like maths."

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.760
 Yeah.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.760
 Well, that's right.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.560
 The one particularly, the Saharan Desert one, the idea, it was a guy called Johann von

00:31:55.560 --> 00:32:02.120
 Litro, who wanted the shapes of what they were digging to be a triangle and a square

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.120
 and a circle.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:09.000
 It would look like a giant PlayStation symbols on the game, sort of as you were passing Earth.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.600
 It was all of these shapes.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.840
 There was another person who thought, "What if we did Pythagoras' theorem?"

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:18.680
 Because that would then display that we know advanced math, that we understand that, and

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.200
 they know there's an intelligent civilization down here.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.200
 Yeah.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.200
 That was Gauss, wasn't it?

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.200
 Who thought that?

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.200
 Yeah.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.200
 Who's that?

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.000
 Gauss is one of the best mathematicians in history.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.880
 I thought there were about 300 different ways of proving Pythagoras' theorem, though.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.000
 And so, if you put one up, you don't know that the aliens will know that particular one.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.640
 I don't think we were necessarily going to put the proof up so much as an example of

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.640
 it.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.640
 Oh, okay.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.640
 Yeah.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.800
 You know, it's always seemed to me a little bit much that here on Earth, some people just

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:54.480
 sort of can unilaterally decide, like, "Hey, I want to send this message to that star,"

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.480
 and then they do that.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:00.160
 Or, "I don't know that it was a ton of people who decided to put like a golden record on

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.280
 Voyager to be like, 'Here's what we are and where we are and what we look like.'"

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.360
 It seemed like it was a pretty small, small group kind of unilaterally making that call.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.360
 Yeah.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.480
 It might prompt a terrible, it might prompt a very bad reaction from whoever receives it.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.640
 I mean, in the case of Voyager, it seems pretty symbolic.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.640
 Yeah.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.640
 I don't know.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.040
 They find it, they think these people are peace-loving.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.040
 They're chumps.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.560
 They will absolutely roll over as soon as we invade.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.560
 Yeah.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:31.840
 There was a guy called Joe Davis, who in 1986 sent the first art piece into space.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.960
 And he did that pretty unilaterally, well, he had a little bit of help because his piece

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:42.240
 was called Poetica Vaginal and he recorded the vaginal contractions of Boston Ballet

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:48.520
 Ballerinas and then sent that recording, that radio recording into space.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.920
 Okay.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.000
 Can we hear it now?

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.960
 I don't have any ballerinas with me, I'm afraid.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.720
 Try to think of what it sounds like.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.720
 Okay.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.560
 Again, it's a very sort of peace-loving artistic message to send.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.320
 I do think we should invest in sending threats into space.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:11.400
 I think if someone sent me through the post, a CD, and I put it into my CD player and it

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.440
 was the vaginal contractions of Ballet Dancers, I would find that quite threatening.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:22.400
 I don't think I would find it as threatening as a space laser, but I hear what you're saying.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.120
 Yeah, it's a warning.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:31.160
 The other thing is, they send music into space, like recordings and music, right?

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:36.400
 The first one that they did was a load of Russian teenagers who sent a theremin concert.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.960
 You know, these theremins is like a big stick and the more you put your hand next to it,

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:46.160
 it goes "wooo" and then there was no more music sent into space deliberately towards

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:51.760
 a star for seven years at which time NASA sent across the universe by the Beatles.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:56.320
 And I just wonder, if aliens just got those two messages, they must have thought we had

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.880
 a hell of a good run after the theremin music to the Beatles.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:05.640
 Wow, they really cracked music with their second song.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.800
 Yeah, it's very exciting.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:13.840
 The way that there's so many different hypotheses about why we haven't made communication with

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.840
 any aliens.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.920
 There's a guy called David Brinn, who's a fiction writer, but he also has this great

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:25.440
 collection of all the different theories and his thinking behind why that might be or might

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.440
 not be possible.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:31.720
 There's a really nice one that I love, which is the Waterworld Hypothesis and the theory

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.720
 goes that...

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.560
 The aliens have seen that movie and thought, "We're not going there."

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:40.720
 Yeah, they just talk about, "Yeah, it really went over budget, apparently, and all sorts

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.600
 of issues with the script."

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:49.440
 The Waterworld Hypothesis is that the idea that there is plenty of life out there, but

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:53.760
 much like dolphins, who are seen as sort of the other great intelligent life on our planet,

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.840
 they're also stuck underwater and they can't get above it because we're living in...

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.840
 What do you mean they're stuck underwater?

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:03.680
 Well, we're living on a planet which is very much in this idea of a Goldilocks belt, right,

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.920
 where we've got a lot of landmass and we've got a lot of oxygen to breathe and so on.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.240
 We're in a beauty spot and it's very rare to be in that beauty spot.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.560
 So the thought is that there is life, but it's underwater.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.560
 What do you mean?

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.560
 It's a surface.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.560
 No, it's a surface.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.800
 Have you not seen the Little Mermaid?

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.800
 It's dangerous.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:24.120
 Well, it definitely creates a huge problem for space travel.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:30.420
 So if you need wet to walk around in, then you've got to carry that wet up with you to

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.960
 space and that's much, much heavier than carrying a bunch of air up with you.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.960
 Sloshing around.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.960
 Yeah.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.600
 But John Lilly, who we've talked about on the podcast before, he...

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.040
 Who you, Dan, you have talked about on the podcast before, yeah?

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.640
 Yeah, I read a whole chapter on it in my book.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.760
 I love the guy.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:55.600
 He tried to create cars that would be driven on the road, which were filled with water.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:59.400
 So you'd be on the road, you turn to your left and there'd be a dolphin sort of swimming

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.400
 away in his car.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.880
 Yeah, he was a genius, guys.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.640
 Dan, you mentioned Seti earlier on and they're looking for, I think, radio waves.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.640
 They are, yeah.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:12.560
 But they've like, they're checking various different parts of the universe at different

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.560
 times.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:19.320
 I've made one comparison that so far, the whole of Seti, since they started, has checked

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:24.320
 so little of the universe that it's the equivalent of checking one hot tub worth of water compared

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.280
 with all the amount of water in all the Earth's oceans.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.760
 It's a big place, James.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.760
 Famously.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.760
 It's a...

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.760
 Yeah.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.760
 Famously large, but...

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.240
 But no, that's incredible.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.400
 It's like getting one hot tub of water and going, "Oh, there's no fish in here, so there's

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.400
 no fish at all."

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.400
 Yeah.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.400
 Yeah.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:46.800
 And the wristwatch you dropped in your hot tub, then in all the oceans in the world.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.800
 Yeah, that's true.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:53.520
 Well, I'm glad that we didn't do the burning lots of oil in the desert thing, because one

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:57.480
 of them would be maybe destroying Mars, but the other one would be definitely destroying

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.480
 Earth.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.480
 Yeah.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.480
 Like us better.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:04.840
 And it would be no use, because I think someone worked out that if Neil and Buzz were standing

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:10.960
 on the moon looking back at Earth from Apollo 11 missions, they just would have no view

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.960
 of it whatsoever.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.880
 Like, it's just not practical.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:17.640
 The Earth is so tiny even from that distance that you wouldn't be able to make that out.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.040
 Those stupid people.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.040
 I read them...

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.760
 In fact, I worked this out a while ago.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.840
 If you wanted to write the word "high" on the moon in such a way that you would be able

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:31.960
 to see it from Earth, even, well, just as in, you would look on the moon and in one of the

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:36.840
 eyes of the man on the moon, you'd be able to see the word "high", then the cross of

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:42.320
 the "H" would have to be the distance of about, I think it was something like Cardiff to Edinburgh,

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.320
 something like that.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.320
 Right.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.320
 Just that one "H" mark.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.320
 Exactly.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.320
 The moon is bigger than I thought it would be.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.240
 The moon's quite big, yeah.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.240
 Yeah.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.680
 You always think of the moon as being tiny, you know, get around it in half an hour.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.680
 That is very big.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.680
 Do I?

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.680
 [Laughter]

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:03.240
 I imagine you seeing Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong after they get back, "Oh, I saw

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.240
 the whole thing there."

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.240
 [Laughter]

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.000
 I mean, you stayed near the ship, God, you're such tourists.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 [Laughter]

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 [Music]

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:18.840
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:26.640
 Okay, my fact this week is that Joey Helpish and Kristen Muir have made more than $10,000

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.360
 from their song "Poopy Stupid Butt".

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.360
 Sounds like a bad guy.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.800
 I'm sure any record label will be happy to have it.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.200
 Yeah, I mean, you could make more from it.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.720
 From a song called "Poopy Stupid Butt".

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:43.320
 I think what it is is that they accidentally made $10,000 without recognizing it.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.320
 That's awesome.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.320
 In that case.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.320
 That's a good way of wording it, yeah.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:52.640
 The reason being, they've made that money because children shout the words "Poopy

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:58.560
 Stupid Butt" or "Play Poopy Stupid Butt" into Alexa, and Alexa just plays it.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:04.320
 And the reason they know this, I read this in an article on Buzzfeed by Katie Natopoulos,

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.680
 and she spoke to a lot of these people who do these kind of things.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:11.200
 And they realized that when they look at all the revenue for all their songs, it's all

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.320
 coming from Amazon Music.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:18.660
 And most musicians would get most of their money from Apple or from Spotify or whatever.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:22.360
 But these people who are getting it mostly from Amazon Music, because it's attached

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.240
 to Alexa, they're pretty certain that the reason they're getting it is because people

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.600
 are shouting things into their Alexa.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.920
 And now there are people who deliberately make songs.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.160
 Well, I mean, shouting, maybe they're politely saying it.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:37.400
 Maybe they're just children politely asking to hear these stupid butts.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.440
 It could be polite, yeah, in fairness.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.360
 I'm giving the children a bad name there.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:47.160
 But yeah, there are people now who go out there and deliberately make songs that children

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.280
 will say to Alexa just so they can make more money in their studios.

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.360
 Okay, what about things that grown-ups will say?

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.880
 So for example, where are my keys?

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:59.920
 Like if you're going, "Oh, have you seen, you know, do you know what time they're coming

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.920
 around?"

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.920
 You know, that kind of stuff.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.840
 And how often do you ask Alexa where your keys are?

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.200
 I don't have an Alexa.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.640
 At a certain point, you're panicking, right?

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.640
 You'll ask anybody.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:14.160
 Well, there is a guy that Katie, who wrote this article, interviewed.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.480
 It's someone she knows called Matt Farley.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.680
 And exactly what you're saying, Andy, he composes songs.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.560
 He's composed more than 23,000 songs.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:28.120
 They're really short, but he uses phrases that might be asked by Alexa, therefore generating

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.120
 him an income.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.600
 So he'll use any kind of phrase or he'll use a celebrity's name inside a song so that

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.680
 accidentally the song will be played.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.280
 His biggest hit, by the way, is a song called Poop, Poop, Poop, Poop Song.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:44.240
 That's been streamed eight million times on Amazon Music.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.680
 He makes, that's where he makes his money, but he makes the point that he didn't get

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.920
 into this to sort of hack the system.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.520
 He was doing this back in the day, back in 2013.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:57.480
 He was like, "I lucked out because smart devices weren't even a thing when I wrote Poop

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:02.720
 in my fingernails, but it turns out I was biding my time unaware."

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:08.040
 He was selling it on a cassette, wasn't he, in a nightclub, saying, "Well, you'll listen

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.360
 to my new tape."

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:18.320
 The Joey Helpich and Kristen Muir won this song, which is called Poopy Stupid Butt.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:22.960
 They ran a music school in Oregon and they worked with autistic kids and they were kind

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:28.360
 of just trying to come up with songs and it's just a part of the playtime almost.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:34.160
 They asked this four-year-old to, it's weird, they asked a four-year-old for a five syllables,

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.760
 which I don't know, four-year-olds know what syllables are, but they asked them for four

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.200
 syllables and this girl shouted out Poopy Stupid Butt and they decided to write a song

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.200
 with the subject.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.920
 It's almost like an improv game.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.920
 Yeah.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.560
 All the kids, because they have a bunch of songs, all the kids have sort of co-written

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560
 the songs.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:55.840
 I don't want to call this shit here, but I don't know if these kids are getting their

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.840
 royalties.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.840
 I don't think they've seen a penny of it.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.840
 This is a good point.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.280
 We were talking royalties at the beginning with the counting system.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.600
 That is harder to get, but should these kids be reimbursed?

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.480
 These are definitely co-writers.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:12.800
 There's no way that that's not a co-writer.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:19.200
 We thought we were going to have a fun time here, but now it's time for legal action.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.840
 I was looking up novelty songs in general.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:29.960
 I think country music is very good at kind of not novelty songs exactly, but like country

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:34.560
 music songs have incredible titles and I just made a list of my favorite ones.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.560
 There's Dropkick Me Jesus Through the Goalposts of Life.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.560
 Yeah.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.400
 Hell, yeah, that's America.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.400
 That's country.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.400
 That's not even novelty.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.920
 That's just down the line country.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:50.800
 City Name Travis wrote that song for sure.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.800
 Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.800
 Oh.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.800
 Beautiful.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:02.480
 And final, I wouldn't take her to a dog fight because I'm afraid she'd win.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.480
 Okay.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.480
 Hell yes.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.480
 Yeah.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.480
 You know.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.480
 Bit sexist, that one.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.480
 Just a bit.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.480
 Well, no, she's just great.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.480
 She's a strong one.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.280
 It's not big teeth, that's all.

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.480
 I haven't listened to the song, it's entirely possible that's the message of it and I'd

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.480
 like to think it is.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.480
 Yeah.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:21.660
 Who do you think what you would say is the greatest novelty songwriter alive?

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:22.660
 Alive.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.660
 Alive.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.660
 Tom Lehrer.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.660
 Tom Lehrer, yeah.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:26.660
 Tom Lehrer.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:27.660
 Okay.

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:28.660
 Okay.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:29.660
 Maybe parody is where I'm sitting.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.160
 He's, I think of him as a satirist.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.160
 Yeah.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.160
 Like Bo Burnham, maybe?

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.160
 But, but he is the greatest.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.160
 I'm thinking Weird Al Yankovic.

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.160
 Oh, Weird Al Yankovic.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:41.360
 Because he's made an entire career of doing these novelty parodies and he's had number

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.360
 one albums.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:48.840
 Well, he's had certainly one number one album, which was his last album in 2014 or '13.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:54.760
 And what's interesting is he suffers hugely from people misattributing other people's

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.520
 parodies to being him.

00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:01.400
 So if you go on, if you go on Torrent sites to download songs, there will be so many songs

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:07.200
 that are under his name and it's a huge problem for him because a lot of these songs have

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:11.180
 terrible attitudes about them, you know, they're racist, they're sexist, they're, they're promoting

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.680
 things that he doesn't agree with.

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:17.720
 And so fans have sort of backed him and tried to separate the non real songs from the real

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.720
 ones.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.600
 There's a, there's a website called the Not Al page where you can look at all the songs

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:27.600
 that are supposedly his songs and then telling you who the real person is.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.240
 So he really hates it because he says he puts a lot of work into his songs.

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.760
 He did one song about a duck.

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:37.160
 He spent a week in a library researching ducks in order to get, you know, the right kind

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:41.940
 of RL Steiner could have written an entire goosebumps novel in the time it took in researching

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.340
 ducks.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:46.900
 But there's one thing he's really going to hate, which has been developed in his name,

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:53.300
 which is there's now weird Al Yankovich AI, which can generate parody lyrics that then

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:57.500
 be attached to existing songs, which then you can sing as, as karaoke.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.880
 So he is now effectively an AI.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.260
 It's going to happen to us all.

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.260
 Yeah.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.260
 That's how it works.

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.260
 Will that happen to us all?

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:09.240
 We will accept that all of ours will be way less good and interesting and fun than that.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.240
 Yeah.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.000
 Because actually, you know, computers could already count to a million, but that guy

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.180
 still did it and still got popular for counting to a million, right?

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.180
 Jeremy.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.180
 Did he get popular?

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.180
 I mean, we mentioned him on a podcast.

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:22.180
 So there's that.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.180
 Jeremy Harper.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.180
 He's still out.

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.180
 He's still out there.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.060
 He's probably on five million by now.

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.060
 Yeah.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:33.760
 I think it must be so hard to count to a million because once you're in like 364,927, I've already

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.300
 forgotten the start of what I just said, you know?

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:37.300
 300 something.

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.300
 Yeah.

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.300
 Well, exactly.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.300
 Yeah.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:41.300
 Tough.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.300
 Maybe you just get into a groove.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.300
 Alexa, count to a million.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:51.180
 That would be a good way of like keeping Alexa busy, you know, stop listening to me.

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.120
 Just count this.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.620
 This isn't for you to hear.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:54.620
 I don't want to be listened to.

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.100
 I don't want to be spied on in my home.

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:57.100
 No, thank you.

00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:01.180
 Go to your room and count to a million.

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:06.360
 The process of training Alexa was very strange because they needed a load of human voice

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.360
 samples to train people on, right?

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.960
 So I think Amazon hired a load of flats and houses in Boston and Seattle and they got

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:18.160
 people in to read scripts of the sort of things maybe that you might ask an Alexa and the

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.160
 scripts were bizarre.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:24.480
 I wonder if it was those same Boston ballerinas as did the other thing.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.480
 Definitely.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.480
 Definitely.

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:30.320
 You need to get an appointment now if you're vagina sounding like that.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.320
 No.

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:35.460
 Well, the problem was that obviously the houses and flats that Amazon had hired, they had

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:38.980
 the string of strangers turning up at a random house all of a sudden.

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:43.180
 And so on, I think more than one occasion, the police were caught because they thought

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:48.020
 it was either drug dealing going on or there was, you know, that suddenly like it was suddenly

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:53.180
 become a brothel and the police showed up and they just saw these actors and some rather

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:54.180
 sheepish Amazon stuff.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.900
 So there's nothing going on here, nothing to see here.

00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:58.900
 That's amazing.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:03.480
 They keep it secret who Alexa is, but a journalist did find out.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.440
 It's a lady called Nina Roll.

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:11.280
 She lives in Boulder, Colorado and she's basically signed effectively like an NDA.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.280
 She got called up.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.360
 She said, "I can't say anything."

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.960
 They make sure that she doesn't say anything in return, but you can hear other ads that

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.600
 she has done where you can identify the voice.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.940
 So she's on her website.

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:26.680
 You can hear her doing an ad for Mott's Apple Juice or a Volkswagen ad and you know it's

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:27.680
 definitely her.

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:33.260
 But the original, original Alexa voice was for a system that was called Ivona and that

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:37.140
 was a Polish thing and it was a sort of voice synthesizer.

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:43.580
 And that originally had a male actor who was the voice behind it called Jacek Labyak and

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:48.700
 he had a horrible time because when it was being used in Poland, the voice synthesizer

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.060
 was being used for everything.

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:54.860
 So he'd pick up his phone and he'd be receiving calls from an automated voice, which was him

00:48:54.860 --> 00:49:00.400
 urging him to vote for a candidate in an upcoming election and then people would say really

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:04.680
 racist random things using his voice and putting it up online.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:09.160
 So he suddenly was hounded by his own voice wherever he went, but it just ruined it.

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.760
 This happened with TikTok as well.

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:15.560
 TikTok had like a thing where you could type in some text and then it would have a person's

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:21.800
 voice say it and it was tapping into an actor's voice thing that had been created, but the

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:27.820
 actor had not given permission for it to be used in this use case and it was used to say

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:33.340
 many terrible things that the actor could hear herself saying and she sued TikTok about

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:35.460
 it and you can no longer get that voice.

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:38.460
 Then they launched a bunch of other voices and they actually did like a partnership with

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:44.580
 Disney so that you can like have the voice of like the Mandalorian say things or Yoda

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:48.980
 or I think Chewbacca also was an option, but it just made Chewbacca noises.

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:53.320
 Hank, are you worried then because there's so much of you out there on the internet.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.560
 Are you worried Tom is going to make a replacement you?

00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:00.320
 Yeah, I was just thinking about this like how far in the future is it before like I

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.240
 could be dead but also still making YouTube videos.

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:08.840
 Like already authors die and then they keep making books somehow because like you know

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:12.440
 what the vibe is, you know, the kinds of books and even before they're dying they're working

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.440
 with co-authors and they just keep making books after they're dead.

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.600
 Yeah, Tom Clancy, Virginia Andrews.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:18.600
 Yeah.

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.180
 There's so many examples.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:24.780
 But like at what point am I just going to keep tweeting after I die?

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:25.980
 Like how hard would that be?

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:27.060
 They're not that good.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:33.060
 Well, there was someone recently on Twitter who said that people should be collecting lots

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:39.020
 of audio of their loved ones so that in 10 years time we'll be able to have virtual loved

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:44.740
 ones where it'll be their voice saying things that they might say to you, which yeah.

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:49.000
 William Shatner, he did a whole thing where he's recorded himself saying so many things

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.200
 and there's a virtual hologram of Shatner now that can basically interact with a kind

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.000
 of chat GBT response.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 But it's Shatner.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.620
 And the plan is that you're, for example, your grandmother, let's say your grandmother's

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:06.340
 passed away, she can still read your children a bedtime story or DJ for you if you like.

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:09.280
 Did you just do Granny's DJ?

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.080
 Dan, do they call it Shat GBT?

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.080
 Oh!

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:15.460
 Oh, they should do.

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:20.640
 I'm worried that they're going to create an AI me, but based on like 2007 me, because

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.560
 I kind of hate that guy.

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.760
 What's wrong with him?

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.760
 He sounds all right.

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.760
 I don't know.

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:31.520
 He's just got a lot of energy I don't have anymore.

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.520
 What's PQ?

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.840
 What's P.Kank to just so we know?

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:38.600
 Just within the last few years, please.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.700
 Oh, you always think that.

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:44.240
 I'm sure that in the future, I will also consider my current self cringe.

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.240
 Yeah.

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:48.080
 No, it is weird thinking about yourself a few years ago.

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:52.400
 They have things where you can like send yourself an email in the future, can't you?

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.400
 Yes.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.400
 Stuff like that.

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:58.600
 Maybe you can do that where it will be your own voice and your own face and everything

00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:59.600
 in the future.

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.400
 Just send yourself a message saying, "I'm not a jerk, honestly.

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.400
 I'm cool."

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:04.400
 Oh, block and delete.

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.400
 Block and delete.

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.400
 That guy.

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.280
 No, he's emailing me all the time.

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.700
 I don't want to hear from him.

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:10.700
 He's a wanker.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:14.660
 Oh, 2006, Andy, mortifying, 19 year olds.

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:19.180
 Could you imagine that like you from 2006, parenting your current child?

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:20.180
 No.

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:24.980
 I think my 2006 me would have a lot more energy than 2023 me.

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:25.980
 Yeah.

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:27.140
 I think that is correct.

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:35.380
 He could certainly drink more.

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.380
 Okay, that's it.

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.380
 That is all of our facts.

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.560

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:37.860
 Okay.

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:38.860
 I'm getting a pico erection.

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:39.860
 Oh!

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:42.860
 Are you sure it wasn't a pico erection?

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:51.460
 Yeah.

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:54.040
 (upbeat music)
