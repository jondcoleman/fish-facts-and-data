00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.620
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.620
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish,"

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.620
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.200
 from Nottingham!

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.200
 (audience cheering)

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.200
 (audience cheering)

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.640
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.000
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.600
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.960
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.960
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.320
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.520
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.200
 - My fact this week is that in 2015,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.400
 paramedics in Australia stopped asking patients

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.720
 to name the Prime Minister as a test of mental capacity.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.640
 (audience laughing)

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.840
 'Cause the answer changes so often,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.380
 it's no longer considered a reliable indicator.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.380
 (audience laughing)

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.220
 - That's amazing.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.080
 - It's absolutely, and it's true, isn't it?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.360
 Australia is constantly trading its PM.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.640
 In fact, there's a Twitter account which is called @WhoIsPM,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.920
 where it gives basically half-hourly updates

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.520
 going, "It's still Scott Morrison."

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.880
 - So what you're saying is if you're in some kind of problem,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.260
 the paramedics come along, you have to go,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.160
 "I'm just gonna need to go on Twitter really quick."

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.600
 - They did say, I think the reason,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.120
 the particular paramedic who was interviewed,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.120
 and the article I read this in,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.360
 the reason that he said he stopped doing it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.320
 was because he'd actually had a patient

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.400
 whom he'd asked, "Who's the Prime Minister?"

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.320
 And they just said, "I don't know,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.000
 "I haven't watched the news today."

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.840
 So.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.960
 - Very nice.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.440
 - That's a strong answer, isn't it?

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.320
 - I didn't really know how crazy Australia,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.760
 I don't know anything about Australian politics

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.600
 before this.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.480
 - So just to clarify it,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.360
 there's this big thing of ousting your predecessor.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.360
 So in 2010, Julia Gillard ousted Kevin Rudd,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.320
 and that was really exciting after only three years.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.680
 But then in 2013, Julia Gillard was ousted, guess who, by?

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.760
 By Kevin Rudd.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.600
 - Yeah.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.680
 - Then in 2015, Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.120
 then Turnbull stayed on.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.360
 And basically, there are so many PMs specifically

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.680
 in that short period.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.800
 - Yeah, it was five PMs in five years

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.400
 if you count Rudd twice.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.000
 - Which you could, 'cause many people say

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.040
 he's sort of got two different personalities.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.360
 - Ooh, wow, wow, super.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.080
 - What's amazing is none of us in this room

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.600
 really know anything about him, but we all oued anyway.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.160
 - It could have been worse, it could be worse.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.920
 If you're in Nepal, for instance,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.960
 and you get caught in an accident,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.600
 since they became a democracy in 1951,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.080
 they've had 53 changes of government.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.120
 - Right, that's a lot.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.960
 - That's a lot.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.800
 - Yeah, that stuff.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.520
 Although if Australia kept up its won a year,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.880
 which it hasn't actually since 2015,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.760
 but you know, it would be beating Nepal.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.480
 - Who is the current Prime Minister?

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.880
 - So that's Scott Morrison now.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.840
 It was Malcolm Turnbull.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.920
 So they've had six and seven years,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.800
 which is quite good, five and five years.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.120
 - So Scott Morrison, is he the one

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.400
 who shit himself in McDonald's?

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.240
 - Sorry?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.080
 - What?

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.920
 - Not familiar with this?

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.400
 - I'm not sure.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.520
 - I think that's what he's most famous for, isn't he?

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.040
 - I don't know if that's what he's most famous for

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.960
 in Australia, the country where he's Prime Minister.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.440
 - He's Australian, I don't know.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.800
 Every time, literally every time he goes on television,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.000
 he says, "Oh, I'm gonna be on ABC tonight,"

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.840
 and someone replies, "Tell us about the time

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.880
 "you shit yourself in McDonald's."

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.000
 - He's the Australian Paula Radcliffe.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Is that what we're saying?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.040
 - Yeah.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.240
 Well, he is running a lot for Prime-

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.920
 - Hey!

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.760
 - Come on, guys.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.760
 - Top crowd tonight.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.600
 - Wow.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.360
 - Aussie politics, it's just a bit more earthy and rude,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.200
 isn't it?

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.600
 Genuinely, genuinely it is.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.520
 It's quite, the stuff they say in Parliament

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.360
 is also really rude.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.000
 So I looked up unparliamentary language

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.520
 from the Australian Parliament.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.880
 And there is a lot, but there is a lot,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.200
 especially if you include all the regional assemblies

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.960
 and things like that, list of things.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.800
 I mean, they call each other nitwit, knucklehead, muppet.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.640
 - That's not that bad.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.160
 - These are a bit mild, yeah, yeah.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.960
 My question is to the village idiot, that was one.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.720
 - And they all answered.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.280
 - Well, there's more.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.520
 In 1994, one member of the Victoria House

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.360
 said to another one,

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.120
 "What is the difference between you and a bucket of shit?"

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.720
 And the speaker rightly said, that's unparliamentary language,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.960
 and he said, "I withdraw bucket."

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.800
 - Wow!

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.680
 - It's had a long history of it.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.760
 Every Australian PM has an offensive nickname.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.200
 The first Australian Prime Minister was called Toby Tosspot.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.040
 - Really?

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.120
 - They named that pretty much straight away, yeah.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.080
 He was Edmund Barton, and it was turn of the 20th century.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.800
 And Tosspot then was a term for someone who drank too much.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.280
 And Toby was just what people were called in.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.200
 - Like you toss a pot back.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.040
 - He could toss a pot back.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.440
 - Toss a pot, 'cause a pot.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.400
 - QI, when I first joined QI,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.160
 and I'm an Aussie, I should say, technically.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.480
 - I wonder what village is missing there, idiot.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.400
 (audience laughs)

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.560
 - I am Aussie.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.680
 My dad's Aussie, and my grandmother's Aussie,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.480
 and I lived there for my whole high school years.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.760
 And when I moved to England, I moved to Oxford,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.320
 where I didn't go to university,

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.800
 but QI was set up there,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.680
 and there's a pub called the Turf Tavern.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.120
 And in the Turf Tavern on the wall,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.040
 one of our Prime Ministers has an award,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.800
 a Guinness World Record, Bob Hawke,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.320
 for downing the quickest yard of ale

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.520
 that anyone has ever done.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.280
 It was in 1954, it was two and a half pints,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.240
 he did in 11 seconds.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.960
 It's since been beaten, but for the rest of his life,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.640
 Bob Hawke, whenever he went to like cricket matches,

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.680
 people would give him a big pint to be like,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.880
 oh, this is like a 70 year old man,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.680
 and he'd fucking down it, and such a champ.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.640
 - I think my favourite Australian Prime Minister,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.480
 sorry, but was Tony Abbott,

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.600
 who was in opposition when I lived there,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.080
 and he's an entertaining man.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.600
 So he's very right wing Tony Abbott.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.520
 He's done some wacky shit, so every Australian knows this,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.400
 but it is worth watching if you haven't seen it.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.280
 He went to visit an onion farm in Tasmania,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.240
 or an onion seller, a big onion selling company,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.800
 and the cameras were on,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.680
 and he was like, God, I won't do the accent.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.520
 God, your produce is so great,

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.800
 grabbed an onion, skin on, and just bit straight into it.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.360
 (audience laughing)

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.440
 Just chowed right down, was asked afterwards

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.280
 what he was doing.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.240
 He said, people eat raw onion all the time.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.720
 It's fine, salads, whatever.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.360
 The skin wasn't on, the skin was on.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.040
 It's very clearly on.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.880
 - Wow.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.080
 - And then he did it again.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.040
 A couple of months later,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.720
 someone sent him a promotional pack of onions.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.120
 He bit down on one again,

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.160
 then footage was on Earth of him eating a raw spring onion.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.400
 The man's got a problem.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.280
 - All spring onions are eaten raw in salads, aren't they?

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.360
 - Just on its own, from the floppy end.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.200
 I mean, I think that's weird.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.040
 - I remember that.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.880
 - That is weird.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.800
 (audience laughing)

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.240
 - I remember reading once that if you hold your nose

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.560
 and you bite an onion,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.640
 then you won't be able to, it'll taste like an apple.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.600
 And I tried that and it is not true.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.160
 (audience laughing)

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.240
 - Maybe that's what he was testing out.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.600
 - The first woman to be elected in Australia

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.280
 was someone called Edith Cowan,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.520
 and she was, she won a seat in West Perth in 1921.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.120
 But she had to go home whenever she needed the toilet

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.040
 'cause there was no female toilets.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.520
 - Oh, wow.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.160
 - Or to McDonald's and shit herself,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.160
 I suppose it's possible.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.400
 (audience laughing)

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.560
 - Did she live nearby?

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.000
 - Yeah, she lived around the corner.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 - But even so.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.280
 I don't, I'm not so, I'm not so...

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.160
 (audience laughing)

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.880
 She lived nearby, fine.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.720
 There was one really cool thing in 2013,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.960
 that was an election in Australia,

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.640
 as there were most years around then apparently,

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.080
 or oustings anyway.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.880
 The voting booths came with magnifying glasses.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.720
 - Oh yeah.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.640
 - Because there were 50 parties on the ballot paper.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.480
 - Wow, wow.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.320
 - There were so many parties

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.280
 that you had to be able to zoom in.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.560
 So it's for, yeah.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.400
 - Wow.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.240
 - I know.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.560
 - Was that the election where,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.960
 I think it was the lead up to that election,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.240
 where they postponed the Prime Ministerial Debate,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.880
 so much like us in Australia,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.160
 they have the incumbent or the two candidates

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.760
 who are going to be Prime Minister before an election,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.880
 go up in debates, various television debates.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.960
 And the last one, it's a massive deal.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.920
 And it's the first time ever,

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.880
 they moved it an hour forward, I think,

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.560
 because MasterChef was on.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.400
 (audience laughing)

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.240
 - Wow.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.080
 - Really, oh, it's big in Australia, yeah.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.920
 - It's good.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.560
 - Do you like it? - MasterChef is good, yeah.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.400
 - That is pretty good.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.720
 - And they are better than the British MasterChef people.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.980
 - Supposedly, the, oh, wow.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.320
 Supposedly, the worst Prime Minister that has ever been

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.720
 in Australia is Billy McMahon.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.600
 He had a bald pointy head with big ears,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.720
 and one opponent said he looked like a Volkswagen

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.040
 with both doors open.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.880
 (audience laughing)

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.800
 He wasn't liked by even the people in his own cabinet.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.200
 There was one guy who he worked with called Paul Hasluck,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.960
 who referred to him as that treacherous bastard.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.920
 (audience laughing)

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.520
 And the guy who was writing his potential autobiography

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.480
 said that he is a third-rate politician

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.880
 and that he could become PM.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.320
 It is a damning indictment on the country.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.200
 Heart Troops lies, cheaper tracks.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.680
 What an unpleasant little turd.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.880
 (audience laughing)

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.200
 - Another, actually, Prime Minister

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.560
 who's considered writing a book,

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.160
 but apparently didn't get round to it,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.440
 is Malcolm Turnbull, who's the last Prime Minister but one.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.040
 And he considered finishing off

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.960
 his mother's raunchy novel.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.440
 (audience laughing)

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.440
 - Wow.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.960
 - He actually, Malcolm Turnbull had kind of a sad childhood.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.680
 He was very close to his dad,

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.320
 who tragically died in a plane crash when he was quite young,

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.840
 but his mother was this academic

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.240
 who'd run away with another man.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.440
 And she went to America,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.120
 and while in America, so she was called something Lansbury,

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.320
 and she was a cousin of Angela Lansbury.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.160
 And while she was in America, Angela Lansbury said to her,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.040
 "Mate, you gotta stop writing this dry,

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.000
 "boring academic stuff and start writing some fun shit."

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.480
 - Wait, so Angela, she's, is she murder she wrote?

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.680
 - Do you know Angela Lansbury, right?

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.600
 Yeah, murder she wrote.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.360
 And anyway, yeah, she wrote a few raunchy novels,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.240
 which sold quite well.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.560
 And then she died halfway through writing a novel called

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.520
 Opium, exclamation mark.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.360
 (audience laughing)

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.440
 - Sounds like a musical.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.360
 - It does, it does.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.600
 - Quite a sleepy musical.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.520
 - Well, I think her son might still be working on it.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.600
 So now he's out of office.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.800
 Maybe we'll get Opium, finally.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.520
 - Malcolm Turnbull's podcast,

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.280
 "My Mum Wrote a Porno," is gonna be...

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.200
 (audience laughing)

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.080
 Stone Cold Hit, I think.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.640
 - On the test that you can get from people,

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.640
 from paramedics, or another one is like,

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.440
 if you've been in a crash and they wanna check

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.360
 if you've been drinking, right?

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.800
 There was a thing with Tiger Woods a few months ago.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.720
 Do you remember he was in a car crash,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.800
 and they wanted to check if he'd been drinking?

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.640
 And so they said to him,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.480
 "Okay, Tiger, what you need to do

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.840
 "is you need to say the alphabet forwards, not backwards.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.520
 "You need to say the alphabet forwards,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.360
 "and you're not allowed to sing it.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.560
 "So, Tiger, do you know what you have to do?"

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.840
 And he said, "Yes, I have to not sing

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.720
 "the national anthem backwards."

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.720
 (audience laughing)

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:52.600
 - Queen Gracious, save, oh, God.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.640
 - You know he's American.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.480
 - Yep, cool.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.320
 (audience laughing)

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.480
 - All right, we need to move on.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.600
 Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.200
 and that is my fact.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.100
 My fact this week is that three people

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.800
 were recently hospitalized

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.880
 after being hit by an iceberg at a Titanic Museum.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.880
 (audience laughing)

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.920
 So this is the Titanic Museum attraction,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.840
 which is in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.960
 and they have this giant ice wall

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.800
 inside of the attraction,

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.160
 and it's 15 foot by 28 foot,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.920
 and it's sort of, it is actual real ice,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.480
 so visitors can actually touch it,

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.600
 and it's grown using a sort of water filtration system,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.160
 and the whole thing just cracked and smashed down,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.960
 and it hurt people, and they were hospitalized,

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.560
 but I think-- - But they survived.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.160
 - They survived. - Yeah, as in you're saying,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.520
 the hearts will go on.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.640
 (audience laughing)

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.880
 - But yeah, I think it's time we don't put any ice

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.440
 near things called Titanic.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.360
 - Yeah.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.680
 - It feels like, 'cause it happens a lot, doesn't it?

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.320
 It's not just-- - I don't know how,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.760
 it's happened twice. - Oh, my God.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.880
 It's happened more than twice,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.960
 famously the first time it happened.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.240
 We've all heard of that one.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.960
 2008, Carnegie Science Center,

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.600
 there was a Titanic exhibit that was in Pittsburgh.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.640
 They had to temporarily close due to flooding,

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.720
 so that stopped them.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.960
 There was a Titanic musical, which was in Southampton,

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.240
 which had to be stopped after the replica Titanic

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.280
 hit the iceberg, and plastic fell off the wall.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.240
 That was the actual iceberg. - Oh, my goodness.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.800
 - Yeah, and everyone, all the audience,

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.280
 thought, "Wow, that's an amazing effect,"

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.560
 but then the crew ran out going,

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.520
 "Stop the show!" (audience laughing)

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.600
 I read, and like, I haven't actually confirmed this,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.240
 but there was another Titanic musical incident

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.400
 where a burst pipe just exploded

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.560
 across the first three rows of the audience,

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.800
 and everyone left angrily, and one person went,

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.480
 "Wow, we truly experienced the sinking of the Titanic."

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.760
 (audience laughing)

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.040
 - Need to confirm that one. - Makes you think.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:02.880
 - Wow. - Nice one.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.080
 You can really empathize with those figures from history.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.200
 Well, there was even in 1898,

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.280
 a Titan ship that hit an iceberg and sank,

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.720
 which was a fictional ship, but a novel was written.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.040
 In 1898, by a guy called Morgan Robertson,

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.360
 it was called "Futility,"

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.800
 starring a ship called Titan,

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.360
 and it had been built in Britain.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.440
 It was sailing to America.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.960
 It was going too fast, hits an iceberg,

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.640
 not enough lifeboats, half the crew die.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.360
 - Yeah, gosh. - In 1898.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.280
 - Very depressing. - There are a few details

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.440
 that are slightly different.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.280
 It also involves in the plot,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.400
 the boat cuts another boat in half

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.440
 while plowing through to the iceberg,

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.800
 and yeah, it just cuts one in half.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.960
 It's about this massive boat that's so huge

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.680
 it leaves other boats in its midst.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.800
 It's sort of like a monster boat.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.080
 And then when it crashes,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.520
 the hero almost goes down with the ship,

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.520
 but thankfully he survives.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.400
 I believe ends up on the iceberg

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.320
 and manages to rescue the young child

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.360
 of the woman he fancies from a polar bear

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.320
 who's trying to eat him.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.400
 - Oh, okay. - So...

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.560
 - So some of it is also...

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.920
 Yeah, that's close, yeah, yeah.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.560
 - Apparently the V&A Museum,

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.240
 they did a Titanic exhibit,

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.920
 and apparently this book, "Titan,"

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.840
 was on the Titanic as part of the reading library.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.080
 - Apparently. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.840
 - Just quickly on Titanic.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.280
 So it was called the RMS Titanic.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.360
 Do you know what RMS stands for?

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.680
 - Royal Mail... No.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.400
 - It's Royal Mail Steamer, okay?

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.240
 'Cause it was a postal ship as well.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.040
 There were 3,000 bags of post on board,

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.280
 but the postal workers,

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.240
 when they found out that the ship was flooding,

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.880
 they tried moving 200 sacks of registered mail

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.360
 to the upper decks of the ship.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.200
 - Oh, really?

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.720
 - They forced several stewards to help them,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.120
 saying, "Look, this is the registered stuff.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.320
 "This is important."

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.960
 They were told not to bother, but they kept going.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.400
 - I always get confused about when a disaster's happening.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.400
 If there's staff members work in a place,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.680
 they're like dedicated to their job,

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.520
 to the point of like,

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.440
 "We've got to play the music till the ship goes down.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.880
 "We've got to bring the mail up."

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.480
 Guys, if there's a fire here tonight,

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.400
 I'm fucking off straight away, right?

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.800
 I am not being like, "Get the audience out!"

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.640
 No.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.720
 - Do you guys know about Clive Palmer's

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.080
 giant Titanic replica, right?

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.200
 Clive Palmer is an Australian billionaire.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.560
 He's an Australian billionaire.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.760
 He's an eccentric.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.240
 He wants to make Titanic too,

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.200
 and he's been promising it for ages,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.400
 and it will be a cruise ship by his company,

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.480
 the Blue Star Line,

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.200
 and it will take the same route as Titanic.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.280
 I mean, I don't know why he thinks people would go on this,

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.320
 but then it's completely recreated inside,

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.920
 and he's been promising it for a long time,

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.000
 and sort of the project keeps having various issues.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.960
 Anyway, it's been moved to Europe.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.360
 The project was gonna be based in Britain,

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.480
 because of Brexit, I'm afraid.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.880
 It's now based in France,

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.040
 and the, yeah, well,

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.400
 if you want Titanic too, don't leave the EU.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.840
 - If only that was on the side of a bus.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.360
 - Unfortunately, it was painted on the side

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.200
 of an enormous ship, which then sank.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.720
 (audience laughing)

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.240
 But the project director in Europe

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.400
 is the director of this whole Titanic project,

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.520
 is his nephew, who's called Clive Mencink.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.040
 - Wow, really?

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.280
 - Yeah, it's doomed.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.120
 - Some other stuff on other weird things

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.320
 that have happened in museums.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.640
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.600
 - This was in Denmark.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.320
 I was reading about an artist called Jens Haening,

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.560
 and what they did was they commissioned him to do this work.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.480
 They were gonna give him 534,000 kroner,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.400
 and what he was gonna do,

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.880
 he was gonna put it in a huge sort of art installation,

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.360
 and it would be a picture of something.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.760
 They didn't know what it was gonna be,

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.920
 and that was the average amount of money

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.720
 that a Danish person earns in a year.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.160
 Anyway, so he went away,

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.840
 and then he came back with a complete empty canvas,

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.120
 and it was an artwork that he called Take the Money and Run.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.560
 (audience laughing)

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.400
 - So good.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.920
 - Did they take that in the good human spirit,

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.760
 which he hoped they would?

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.640
 - The guy who runs a museum said,

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.880
 "He stirred up my curatorial staff,

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.600
 "and he also stirred me up a bit,

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.360
 "but I also had a laugh 'cause it was really humoristic."

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.720
 But then he did say that he needs to pay the money back.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.960
 (audience laughing)

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.000
 - I really like incidents of museums,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.720
 you just, you know, making flubs and blunders

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.680
 and accidentally ruining exhibits and things like that.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.560
 So the National History Museum,

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.440
 they released a list of their incidents in 2009.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.600
 One of them, slightly shortly before that,

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.720
 was there were these things called conodonts,

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.160
 which are their extinct eel-like creatures, okay?

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.840
 They had 22 of them,

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.800
 and they were accidentally knocked over and then hoovered up.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.440
 (audience laughing)

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.800
 Which I just, I like.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.160
 - Did they retrieve them from the back?

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.240
 - No, I don't think so.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.080
 - Why? - Oh, shit.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:40.920
 - Well, I think they were ruined

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.000
 in the process of being hoovered up.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.840
 I think that's not--

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.040
 - Oh, they're just a bit fluffy.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:44.880
 - Yeah, exactly. - Sorry.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.520
 - Just wipe that off. (laughing)

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.880
 - There was, there was an art gallery

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.200
 that had a exhibition,

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.840
 I can't remember, I can't remember what it was,

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.080
 but it was an exhibition that showed lots of like,

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.120
 remnants from a party,

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.240
 kind of cigarette butts and empty beer bottles

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.120
 and, you know, stuff strewn around,

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.400
 and the cleaner cleaned it all up in the morning.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.720
 - Yeah, that happens a bunch, yeah.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.840
 Like Damien Hirst had one where the garbage was carried.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.720
 There was one where there was a garbage bag,

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.280
 and they took it away and they apologized,

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.120
 and he was like, "That's fine."

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.320
 He just gave another garbage bag.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.680
 - Yeah, I'm sure I must have said it on here before,

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.000
 but the time I went to an art gallery in Barcelona,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.240
 and there was someone collapsed in the corner,

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.480
 and I ran to the front and said,

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.320
 "Oh, does someone collapse in the corner of that room?"

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.520
 And they went, "No sir, that is part of the exhibit."

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.520
 (laughing)

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.440
 And it was just a doll,

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.560
 and I said, "Oh, that must happen all the time."

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.400
 And he went, "Nope."

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.640
 (laughing)

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.200
 - It happens so much,

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.880
 but it does happen with specific works of art,

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.920
 like either someone collapsed

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.360
 or just something that is designed to look like rubbish.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.200
 So there was a, in 2011 there was an artwork

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.760
 which featured a bathtub

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.600
 with a sort of thick, scummy line around the inside,

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.800
 and that was scrubbed by an overzealous

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.080
 member of cleaning staff.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.640
 - Did she not wonder why there was a bath

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.720
 in the middle of the gallery?

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.120
 - Exactly, I think that's a fair cop, actually.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.280
 But there's an article called Joseph Buys,

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.440
 B-E-U-Y-S, Buys, who had not Buys.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.120
 What a fun, oh, I mean, never stop saying that name.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.280
 - It's all about the Buys.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.960
 (laughing)

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.080
 - He had an artwork which was a grease stain,

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.720
 and that was unsurprisingly scrubbed.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.000
 And it wasn't the first time it had happened to him.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.360
 He also had a baby bathtub in 1973 on display,

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.640
 which was wrapped in gauze and bandages.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.040
 So baby bathtub wrapped up.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.280
 Anyway, two cleaners just took it to wash the dishes in,

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.400
 'cause they thought this cannot possibly be a work of art.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.240
 - Oh, really?

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.080
 - Yeah.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.640
 - I feel like all the stories involved cleaners

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.960
 fucking stuff up, and we need to maybe--

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.040
 - A lot of blame on the cleaners,

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.360
 a lot of blame on the cleaners, yeah.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.560
 - Yeah, we need to have a conversation

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.160
 with the cleaners at museums saying,

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.280
 you see all the random fucking shit here?

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.800
 It's meant to be easier if you're at

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.480
 the National Portrait Gallery, isn't it?

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.120
 It's much, much easier to tell what's art

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.360
 and what isn't at the National Portrait Gallery.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.200
 - That's true.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.160
 - 'Cause it's a portrait.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.000
 - Exactly.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.280
 - You're not gonna see a picture of someone's face

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.480
 and go, I'm just gonna rub that off.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.680
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.280
 - Just gonna get rid of Rembrandt's mole.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.120
 Hang on.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.640
 - Macron, the president of France,

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.920
 he did a report in 2018,

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.480
 and he found that 90 to 95% of Sub-Saharan Africa's

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.440
 cultural heritage was held in museums outside of Africa, okay?

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.960
 So pretty much all of it's been taken out of Africa.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.400
 And so there's a guy called Mwazulu Diabanza,

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.320
 who is an artist, and he's decided

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.880
 he's just gonna go to museums and steal it back.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.920
 - Cool.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.840
 - And so he basically goes around.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:32.040
 So he goes around all these museums in France,

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.040
 and he'll just kind of walk in and see,

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.840
 oh, there's an ivory spear there that was from Congo,

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.560
 and he'll just go in and walk out and walk straight out with it.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.160
 Occasionally, he did want to steal a sculpture

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.080
 that was actually from Indonesia.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.920
 - Okay, right.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.040
 - There was a bit of a mistake,

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.920
 but obviously he's been arrested from time to time.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.800
 But this lawyer said, I don't know of any thief

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.960
 who turns up to a museum and says, film me.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.520
 And then, having been filmed stealing the article,

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.960
 puts it back.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.360
 So he doesn't put it back afterwards.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.760
 - Oh, well that doesn't work out.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.600
 - I thought he was like a reverse Indiana Jones, you know?

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.240
 That doesn't belong in a museum.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.360
 That's the line from the third film, it doesn't matter.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.400
 - And then what is he chasing after a massive ball?

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.240
 - He, yeah, that's right.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.840
 He actually, he puts his hat into a room

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.200
 just as there's a wall about to crush him.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.120
 Yeah, it's very exciting.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.000
 - Just on injuries in museums, which this is about,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.640
 there's a man who's suing Melbourne Science Works,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.160
 Science Museum in Melbourne,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.240
 for an exhibit they have where they have

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.480
 a virtual sprinter, Kathy Freeman,

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.600
 Olympic medal-winning sprinter,

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.000
 and they encourage you to race against her

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 on a 10-meter track.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.800
 And what they have done is they've put the 10-meter track

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.800
 immediately in front of a wall, a quite solid wall.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.440
 (audience laughing)

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.720
 And he's suing them because he's broken two vertebrae,

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.920
 another bone and a rib,

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.080
 and lost the feeling in his arms and hand

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.120
 because he ran headlong into a wall.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.600
 - Oh my God.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.800
 There's a French museum that was gonna hold an exhibition

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.720
 about Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.240
 But they were told by the Chinese government

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.480
 that they could only have the stuff

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.520
 if they didn't mention the words empire, Mongol, Genghis,

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.360
 or Khan.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.360
 (audience laughing)

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.280
 - All right, we need to move on to our next fact of the show,

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.000
 and that is fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.040
 - My fact is that there are nine hammocks on the moon.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.760
 - Who's using them?

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.040
 - Also, like no trees.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.880
 - Yes, what a good point.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.720
 There are nine tragically unopened hammocks on the moon.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.800
 This is from a book called "An Answer for Everything."

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.360
 One of the pages is about everything there is on the moon.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.800
 One of the things is, loads and loads of hammocks

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:52.800
 because Apollo 11, the first man landing on the moon,

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.160
 they slept really badly, they slept appallingly,

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.320
 and they just got a terrible night's sleep

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.160
 when they were there.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.160
 - Well, it was sort of, so yeah, they were in the lander

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.280
 and they didn't really think of that,

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.040
 and it's so crowded, so Buzz Aldrin, I think,

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.240
 was basically laying on the floor as if he was just,

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.440
 you know, like you would if you were drunk

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.600
 and you got home and couldn't find the bed.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.040
 That was him, and they thought we need to sort that.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:18.040
 - Yeah, absolutely, so they, when Apollo 12 to 17

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.420
 flew with more man missions to the moon,

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.160
 they had these specially designed lunar hammocks

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.680
 that would go in the lander, and when you come back,

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.200
 you can't bring all your stuff with you,

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.320
 so they just left the hammocks behind.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.600
 - And so, yeah, and it's amazing to think about it

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.960
 because they would land on the moon,

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.560
 and then they would set their hammocks up

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.780
 in a sort of X shape, so one lower and one above,

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.640
 and that's, they would just lay in it and just--

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.120
 - And this is not on the moon, we should say,

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.960
 this is inside the lander, right?

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.280
 - Inside the lander on the moon, though.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.000
 That is how they slept, like they were on

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.520
 some sort of desert island, but the problem was,

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.400
 and the problem for a lot of these missions was

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.400
 the adrenaline is so great, you're on the fucking moon,

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.840
 you're not going to sleep, right?

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.680
 - Well, so--

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.960
 - And when Armstrong and Aldrin landed,

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.320
 they were scheduled to have a nap.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.160
 - Yeah.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.560
 - And the mission control said, right, you're on the moon,

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.720
 off to bed you go, and they said, absolutely not.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.640
 We would like to go on to the moon now, please.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.160
 - You know how, like, at nighttime, the moon comes out?

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.760
 If you're on the moon, does it always kind of

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.200
 feel like nighttime, or--

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.040
 - Good question.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.880
 - Do you think you'd just be really sleepy

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.720
 the whole time?

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.320
 - I think I would, yeah, just naturally.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.720
 - Apollo 14, unfortunately, where they landed

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.080
 with Apollo 14 was on a seven degree slant,

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.840
 so the lander was just slightly tipping,

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.960
 which freaked the shit out of the astronauts inside,

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.240
 so they couldn't get to sleep,

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.840
 because any time they heard a noise,

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.680
 they thought we're about to tip over,

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.760
 and you can read the actual transcripts

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.240
 of what they were chatting about, so one transcript goes,

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.880
 and this is while they were trying to sleep, I think,

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.720
 they go, Ed, did you hear that?

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.440
 He goes, hell yes, I heard that.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.400
 What the hell was that?

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.040
 I don't know.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.560
 Ed, what?

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.200
 Why the hell are we whispering?

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.640
 (audience laughing)

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.760
 But they couldn't go to sleep, they were so worried about,

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.400
 so that didn't happen, and then slowly Apollo 15,

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.880
 and 16, it got better and better.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.240
 - I think mainly they had to make it better

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.520
 for Apollo 15, because that was the first time

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.200
 they'd stayed on the moon any length of time

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.480
 that required sleep, they were there for three nights,

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.280
 and they had to do proper stuff on the moon,

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.200
 like collect loads of samples, and drive,

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.040
 you can't drive when you're sleep deprived.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.000
 It was the first time they had a car on the moon,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.880
 and so they got proper hammocks,

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.720
 and I think they solved it

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.080
 by basically letting them take their space suits off, right?

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.680
 It was the first time that they'd allowed them

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.400
 to go back into the lunar lander and actually strip down

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.200
 so that you can adopt a comfortable position.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.040
 - And I suppose the reason that the hammocks are on the moon

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.960
 is because you need to get rid of all your stuff

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.120
 when you're gonna take off again,

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.720
 'cause it needs to be as light as possible, right?

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.560
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.240
 - So I was speaking to this morning

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.720
 to someone called Beth O'Leary,

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.480
 who pretty much invented something called space archeology,

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.160
 she's a scientist, and she said that basically

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.000
 when Apollo 11 came down at least,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.280
 for about eight minutes, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.280
 stood on the corner of their lunar module

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.760
 and just threw anything out that they didn't need.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.520
 They just threw it all out, we don't need this,

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.200
 we don't need that, we don't need the other.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.720
 - That's a steering wheel, Buzz, I'll get it.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.880
 I'm sorry, I think I heard Miss Ellis.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.720
 - In archeology, apparently that is called a toss zone.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.880
 - It's 'cause they fill the thing with rocks, right?

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.960
 - Yes, yes. - So weird going,

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.000
 dumping all the useful stuff and just filling it up

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.160
 with rocks for the way back, but...

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.360
 - They did leave some things,

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.960
 which now NASA would like to look at,

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.320
 but NASA would only like to look at them

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.080
 because they left them there, if you see what I mean.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.200
 So bags of poo, basically. - Yes.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.360
 - Bags of poo, urine, and vomit.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.400
 There are 96 bags of all of this stuff

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.080
 on the surface of the moon still today,

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.640
 and NASA is fascinated to know what's happened

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.760
 biologically with them and what has lasted

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.400
 and what hasn't and what they could tell from it.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.320
 And so if they go back to the moon,

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.680
 if there's another crewed mission to the moon coming up soon,

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.280
 it is possible that one of their jobs

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.880
 will be finding bags of poo,

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.960
 just doing a pooper scoop on the moon.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.680
 - The truth is that it's not just that,

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.920
 it's everything that they left there.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.520
 They want it to be like kept as it is, right?

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.240
 Because let's say Elon Musk goes up there

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.320
 for a party or something.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.440
 What they don't want is him kind of knocking over

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.800
 all the flags and all the poo and all the hammocks and stuff.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.720
 They want it all to be as it is.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:26.640
 And so this year, actually the 31st of December last year,

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.960
 the US enacted the One Small Step

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.600
 to Protect Human Heritage and Space Act,

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.160
 which made it illegal to touch anything on the moon

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.840
 that the humans have left there.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.280
 And it was really, really controversial

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.640
 because by law, no one owns the moon,

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.000
 no one owns any of the land on there,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.920
 but America owns the objects that are on the land.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.400
 And so it was really dodgy.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.160
 The Soviets, sorry, the Russians really didn't want.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.880
 (LAUGHTER)

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.400
 I think you've made your allegiances very clear there, James.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.400
 (LAUGHTER)

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.520
 But they didn't really want the Americans to have this kind of law

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.760
 saying no one can touch this area because, well, it doesn't belong to you.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.280
 Who are you to say who touched it and who doesn't touch it?

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.480
 And even more than that,

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.640
 if you look at the footprints of Neil Armstrong, for instance,

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.240
 theoretically, America owns the footprints,

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.640
 but they don't own any of the dust which creates the footprint.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.120
 They're in the space directly above that dust.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.720
 Yeah, they own the concept of the footprint, but not what makes it.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.720
 Yeah.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.280
 Wow, the cleaners are going to have an absolute nightmare

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.320
 when they turn up to the moon.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.000
 Which bit of this is the party and which bit is debris preserved?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.360
 (LAUGHTER)

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.240
 It's amazing that I hadn't thought of that, that in theory,

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.120
 Neil Armstrong's one small step for man,

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.400
 that one small step is still there, right?

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.400
 Possibly, yeah.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.400
 Possibly because it was right at the bottom of the ladder,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.760
 so Buzz might have landed and just smudged it out immediately, pissed off.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.880
 Very likely, Buzz was here, right next to it.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:55.200
 But like, the last thing that was left by an astronaut on the moon

00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.080
 wasn't a physical object, but it was the last astronaut who was there

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.400
 who wrote, like you would in The Sand at a Beach,

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.480
 wrote the letters TDC, and that was the initials of his daughter,

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.480
 and that was Eugene Cernan, the last person to stand on the moon.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.960
 And in theory, unless that bit of the moon is hit by, you know,

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.680
 space rocks and so on,

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.360
 that's going to be there for at least, you know, 50,000 years.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.440
 Well, because there's not the same kind of atmosphere on the moon

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.680
 to mess it up.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.040
 So in theory, Neil's footprint, if Buzz managed to sort of, like,

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.240
 do a wide berth with his landing, is still there, which is amazing.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:38.400
 There is 100 metric tons of human material on the moon, man-made,

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.600
 which, if you can imagine there being a massive mirror in front of a theatre

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.000
 somewhere in the, you know, Midlands of England,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.640
 it would be approximately 10 times the weight of that thing.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.200
 That's going to mean a lot to all the listeners at home.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:59.720
 It's also going to be confusing when James boosts that laugh in the edit.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.240
 Here's one thing you can get if you go to the moon.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.920
 The secret to David Copperfield's magic tricks.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.720
 No! Yes, they are on the moon now.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.720
 There was this private mission, there was a crash on the moon in 2019,

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.000
 which I can't believe we didn't, more wasn't made of it,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.440
 there was a private spacecraft called Beresheet, and it had a disk on it.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:22.640
 It had a sort of human library, which had Wikipedia, had thousands of books,

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.440
 and one of the other things on it was the technical illustrations and diagrams

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.200
 for David Copperfield's magic tricks.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.440
 It's not certain that it survived, but it was in a really well,

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:34.640
 it wasn't just a DVD, it was a 25-layer sandwich of metal and resin,

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.240
 it was really well protected, and so it is possible it is surviving there.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.520
 And Copperfield said he was so inspired by the idea of the mission

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.000
 that he wanted to give away secrets.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.400
 I mean, when aliens get there and find that,

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.320
 they're not going to have the saw or the box to put the woman in.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.280
 Or even the woman to put in the box.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:55.240
 Another thing on the moon, a bunch of flags, as we know,

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.160
 very controversial at the time, whether to erect an American flag on the moon.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.400
 So when Apollo 11 first went there, there was this big debate in the US,

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.000
 because it was that post-colonial era when everyone was saying,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.440
 "That was really bad," where we stamped our flags in countries that weren't ours

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.840
 and claimed that they were, "Let's not do that again."

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.920
 And so they said, "Okay, we probably shouldn't put an American flag there,

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.240
 'cause it's like we're claiming it."

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.400
 And then there was a suggestion, which they seriously considered and almost did,

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.960
 to instead bring up a miniature flag for every country on Earth,

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.600
 for them to put into the soil at once.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.720
 A little village.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.000
 A little village.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.800
 It's so sad they didn't have 160 tiny flags.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.160
 I think it was a relief, 'cause it sounded like a real arseake

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.080
 hammering the one flag in.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:38.800
 Right, really.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.840
 So what do you do when, for instance, South Sudan?

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.400
 The South Sudan problem.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.560
 You've got to go back.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.680
 Every time there's a new country, you have to go back.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.760
 Please don't divide into two countries.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.800
 It's going to be so expensive for NASA.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.560
 There already is.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.280
 Not a model village, but a model something on the moon.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:58.800
 There's a model.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.280
 It's a miniature art gallery, which is very exciting.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:02.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.720
 It's called the Moon Museum, and an artist called Forrest Myers

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.760
 commissioned artworks from six different artists

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.120
 to draw tiny, tiny drawings.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.880
 And the engineer, at NASA, he gave it to,

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.520
 says that he stuck it onto the leg of the lunar module.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.480
 So it's there.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.640
 There's no confirmation it's there,

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.360
 but it's got Andy Warhol's signature.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.240
 So why do you think he might be lying?

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.280
 No one has properly confirmed it.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.000
 Yes, we saw that.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.320
 And obviously, the lunar module is still there,

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.680
 so we don't know if there's a tiny--

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.080
 Was it Andy Warhol's signature, just the cock and balls?

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.000
 Well, it looks a lot like a cock and balls, yes.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.960
 But there's also a sketch of Mickey Mouse on that tile.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.800
 Does a Mickey Mouse look like a cock and balls?

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.080
 I think.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.040
 Flip Andy Warhol's signature upside down,

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.440
 and you've got Mickey.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.960
 I think that says more about you, James, than it does.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.800
 It says a lot about my childhood, doesn't it?

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.440
 Yeah, so there's no final confirmation

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.440
 that there is a tiny art gallery on the moon.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.480
 But wouldn't that be nice?

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.960
 Actually, speaking of cock and balls in space,

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.960
 there was a lot of worry when astronauts first went up,

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.680
 whether-- well, not a worry, but they

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.560
 were interested whether you could have sex up there or not,

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.560
 because people thought that if you have an erection,

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.800
 the gravity might be needed to get the blood down there.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.880
 But luckily, there was a guy called Michael Malaine, who

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.920
 was interviewed by Men's Health Magazine in 2014.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.840
 And he said that sometimes he had a boner

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.840
 that I could have drilled through kryptonite.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:26.920
 So that's--

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:27.600
 Oh, wow.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.640
 That's put that to bed.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.920
 What an image.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.960
 There's some kryptonite.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.600
 None of our drills are working.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:39.320
 Can we get that guy with his rock hard boner and drill him?

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.400
 Oh, my god.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.880
 Imagine that guy's day every day.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.760
 How was work, honey?

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.440
 Yep.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.800
 Managed to break through the unbreakable rocks with my dick.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.920
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.840
 OK, my fact this week is that deer penises are often

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.480
 sold with the pelvis attached, so the buyer knows they're not

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.760
 being ripped off with a seal's penis.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:08.760
 If I had a quid for every seal penis,

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.040
 I would have sent back to the shop, outraged.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.120
 Well, the problem was you broke the seal, didn't you?

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.120
 And--

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.280
 I don't think it was me who broke the seal

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.720
 if I'm receiving his penis through the post.

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:26.640
 So this was an article on the online magazine Stuff.NZ.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.920
 And it was about New Zealand's Pizzle Market.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:35.000
 New Zealand sells deer penises mostly to China and to Hong Kong

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.600
 because they're used in traditional Chinese medicine

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.320
 as a sexual vigor enhancer.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.200
 And this was basically just telling us

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.960
 how well they're doing in the last year or so.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.600
 They've sold $5.2 million worth of pizzle.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.200
 That's 1,700 tons of deer pizzles.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.840
 So if you can imagine a large sort of metal

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.720
 mirror that might be outside of theatre in the Midlands,

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.480
 it's about 170 of those.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.440
 That's how much it costs.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.440
 I think that since 1994, like, it's the total.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.560
 Sorry, yeah, that's right, yeah.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.240
 But it's a lot.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.960
 It's a lot of pizzle.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.360
 I didn't know anything about pizzle before.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.840
 I didn't know that was a word.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.440
 Yeah, well, I only knew it because I studied English.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.480
 And there's a line in Shakespeare where someone says,

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.360
 "You bull's pizzle."

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.280
 That's a great insult.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.600
 I only knew it because of Snoop Dogg

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.200
 going shizzle-dizzle, man, nizzle-pizzle.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.880
 I think if Snoop Dogg asked you to snizzle his pizzle,

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.960
 then you'd be like, "I want to get out of that party."

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.960
 I regret that evening.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.320
 Yeah, a lot closer than, yeah.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:35.680
 But cattle pizzle is sort of a dog treat.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.640
 I didn't know this.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.080
 I think that's the only reason I knew it.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.600
 But we've all got different origin stories for pizzle.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.480
 Yeah, you get bull's pizzle for dogs.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:46.520
 Right, but clearly they do, but it's very distressing.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.360
 I agree with Andy.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.080
 I've seen those, but does it say on the packet, "Genuine penis"?

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.600
 No, I don't think it says.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.880
 I think in the ingredients somewhere,

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.920
 it makes clear that it is the pizzle of a bull.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.800
 I don't know if it has some genuine penis

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.960
 down across the front, like a warning sign.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.160
 I think that should be said on things I'm buying.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.280
 We'll all club together, Dan,

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.640
 and we'll get you a T-shirt that says it.

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.640
 How about that?

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.640
 Do you know...

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:18.080
 Took a while for you to get there.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.800
 But the prep is really...

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.320
 It's upsetting, isn't it?

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.160
 If you're the deer.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.200
 If you're the deer or the well-op...

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.320
 So you take it, you clean it, you wash it,

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.440
 you hang it, you stretch it,

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.360
 then you cook it for several days.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.400
 This is the worst daft punk something I've ever done.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:41.200
 Stretch it, hang it, clean it, cut it.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.920
 It's really upsetting.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:50.720
 It is, and actually, the farmers tend to not get paid for it.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:54.000
 If you're a deer farmer, you don't get extra money for your pizzle.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.240
 It... The money goes...

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.240
 For your deer's pizzles.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.640
 The money goes to the people who kind of cut it up,

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.840
 the butchers and stuff like that,

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.440
 and then they get it as an extra bit of money.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.840
 And there was a guy who was in charge of Deer Industry New Zealand,

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.920
 and he said that it can't be justified

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.760
 that you can pay them extra for it

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.200
 until farmers have a way of producing animals

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.280
 with attributes like larger tails or pizzles.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.240
 So until you can find the way of making a deer

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.240
 with an absolutely enormous penis,

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.240
 you're not going to get paid extra for it.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.960
 OK, because the butchers have to do a lot of work, basically.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.920
 Because there is a big difference in value with size, isn't there?

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.000
 So they're sold in different sizes.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.240
 You've got the under 10-inch, lame, 10 to 12-inch...

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.240
 10 to 12 inches, OK, 12 to 14.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.520
 And then over 14 inches is where it's really at

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.040
 if you want to have all your virility problems solved,

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.720
 according to Chinese medicine.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.520
 And somewhere up to 20 inches long,

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.560
 which I think you're pretty much immortal once you've eaten that.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.400
 Some are 36.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.600
 -That's even longer than 20. -Really?

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.600
 Well, that's after they've been stretched, yeah, yeah.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.240
 -After the stretching. -That's after the stretching process is over, yeah.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.640
 And we should say the reason...

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.440
 Oh, maybe you did say that the reason the deer is so...

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.720
 Well, the reason it's upsetting when you get a seal instead of a deer

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.720
 is because the deer is so valuable, right?

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.440
 A seal penis is nothing compared to a deer.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.280
 And in fact, there are often others being substituted for deer penises.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.640
 Like, I think there's a big problem with sheep's penis and testicles,

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.760
 -pizzles. So, a pizzle is sort of the two together. -Mm.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:33.080
 Sheep's pizzle being sold counterfeiting, pretending to be deer pizzle.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.520
 And it's because sheep have much bigger testicles,

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.840
 -and so they get a lot more bang for their bark. -Yeah, you can bulk it out, can't you?

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.360
 -It's not a bark, guys. -Right.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.560
 -Oh, very nice. -Oh!

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.480
 I can't... In my head right now, I can't picture a seal's penis.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.960
 (LAUGHTER)

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.520
 No, no, you're right.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:56.000
 So, like, I can picture a bull and a sheep, but a seal...

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.360
 If we're talking, do they have testicles as well?

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.040
 -I guess they are inside. -I guess they are inside.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.280
 -The testicles. -They're inside.

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.400
 -I think so, yeah. -Ah.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.480
 Weird thing that just happened, I just pictured seal's penis,

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.880
 and that's the singer, and...

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.880
 (LAUGHTER)

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.200
 -He's good. -You're in public, Dan.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.520
 Like, you're doing a show. You don't need to say everything

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.480
 -that comes into your head. -Well, I couldn't see a seal's, but then I thought,

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.360
 "Oh, seal, he must have one." And...

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:23.000
 -My God, he does. -I think they have, like, a genital slit,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.240
 which then opens up and the penis comes out.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.880
 -Seal's. -The singer, yeah.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.600
 (LAUGHTER)

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.520
 Have you guys heard of Fuchsia Dunlop?

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.240
 -Uh, yeah. -She is an English writer and cook,

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.680
 and she was the first Westerner to train as a chef

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.720
 at the Sichuan Institute in Chengdu.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:45.800
 And she has written one of the greatest articles I have ever read online

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.560
 about cooking, um, "pizzles."

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.640
 She used some traditional Chinese recipes to do this.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.720
 She made it into kind of a stew.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.800
 Uh, she said, "The raw testicle penises in particular

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.800
 "were a shocking sight, because they were too big to fit in the fridge."

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.000
 (LAUGHTER)

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.040
 So she kept them outside on the side.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.880
 "The silent presence, huge, furry and outrageous,

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.120
 "cast a strange atmosphere over the apartment that night."

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.440
 (LAUGHTER)

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.480
 And she goes on and goes on about how she kind of cooked these things.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.600
 And she said that, at one stage, she says,

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:25.400
 "The next step was the bleaching, at which the "pizzles are abruptly stiffened.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.960
 "One of them lunged out of the saucepan when we weren't looking."

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.280
 (LAUGHTER)

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.360
 "Lunged."

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.000
 (LAUGHTER)

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.640
 I could go on and on, but it is the greatest article.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.640
 I'll put it on my Twitter. I don't believe I'll be good.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.640
 She's amazing if you've done that. I've got her cookbook.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.400
 She's the woman who brought Chinese cooking to the West, really.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.520
 -Oh, really? -Yeah, yeah.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.240
 -She's still alive. -Fabre recipes, yeah.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.880
 -Nice. -Have you...

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.880
 You guys may have found this in the course of your research,

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.000
 but another useful pizzle, if you're not feeding it to a dog

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.400
 or whatever it may be, or using it in traditional Chinese medicine,

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.920
 is that it makes a good walking stick.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:02.040
 -For a very small person. -What? Yeah. What, for Yoda?

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:05.400
 For a three-foot walking stick?

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.000
 -That's a reasonable height. -But that's after it's been stretched.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.120
 It's after it's been stretched. Yeah, that's correct.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.680
 We're all... OK, we're on the same page now.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.480
 That's a decent size, I promise.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.240
 And basically, you can get these on...

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.560
 I can't believe I'm having to defend a 36-inch walking stick.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.000
 Anyway, you can get them on eBay.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.920
 There are some on eBay, which are antique,

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.920
 and there is also a website, fashionablecanes.com,

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:31.200
 which has a lengthy section of prose about...

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.600
 The legendary bull penis cane is the most unique of all walking canes.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.400
 And it's sort of... There's a rod down the middle,

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.040
 and then it's stretched over this, but it's genuine pizzle being used.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.160
 And it goes on and on and on about, you know,

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.400
 using one of these canes will shock anyone when you tell them what it is

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.560
 and it's sure to create an interesting conversation.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.800
 It lists lots of people who've used canes in the past,

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.600
 Johnny Depp, Madonna, Brad Pitt.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.000
 None of them had penis canes, though.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.880
 And this website is amazing, it goes on and on.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.120
 It says, "Even if a cow penis cane is not your style,

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:08.880
 "it can make the perfect gift for that hard-to-buy person on your list.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:13.960
 "It makes the perfect over-the-hill or retirement gift."

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:19.600
 If I retire and you guys give me a stretched bull's penis walking stick,

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.640
 I won't take it well.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.880
 - Come on, you'll be absolutely delighted. - You'd love it.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.320
 It's not very useful on a cold day when you're going for a walk.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:38.520
 This is a traditional cure for impotence, I suppose, right?

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:42.440
 It's largely what you'll grind up, some bull's pizzle or some deer pizzle.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.000
 You'll drink it, you'll go on for years.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.120
 - And I was just looking at some other... - The cryptonite won't know what hit it.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:53.920
 The planet of Krypton was split in two.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:58.000
 So, if the pizzle didn't work,

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.560
 quite an important part of the Protestant Reformation,

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.720
 according to my reading, which was biased towards the word "pizzle" fine,

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.920
 was this other ritual that you would do to solve impotence.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.400
 So this is around 15th century, 16th century.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:17.160
 It was to urinate through your wife's wedding ring and...

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:22.040
 - From what distance? - I think she's wearing it at the time.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:27.960
 But this was cited as one of the reasons that Calvin wanted to do away

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.160
 with the exchange of wedding rings, because he was, you know,

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.720
 Calvin's great Protestant leader, he was worried that this superstition

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.880
 was kind of taking over the wedding ring superstition.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.440
 Men were just sort of pissing through women's wedding rings all the time.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.280
 And it said, "If that didn't work and you still couldn't get it up,

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.920
 "then you had to go and urinate through the keyhole of the church

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.480
 "that you got married in."

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.480
 No!

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.000
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.360
 That's what that TV show, "Through the Keyhole," used to be about.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.600
 "Who pissed in a house like this?"

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.400
 What's that done, do you think?

00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.520
 I believe it was done.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.440
 Well, the wedding ring thing was done enough for Calvin to want to ban it,

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.320
 so I reckon the keyhole thing was done enough for priests to be pissed off

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.960
 - and those cleaners to be very confused. - Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:08.960
 - Yeah. - Wow.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.760
 Another thing for the cleaners in the churches is,

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.640
 "Is this meant to be here this year?"

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.400
 Viagra.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:21.520
 Does anyone need any? Because I have a bunch on me.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:27.520
 - No, Viagra was invented and patented by Pfizer. - Yeah.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:32.200
 Pfizer, who have just stepped up to help try and save the world with the vaccine.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.080
 - Yeah. - I've been injected with Pfizer myself.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.000
 You sound so surprised. It's not like they were a little, like,

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.400
 blackberry-selling startup.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:43.600
 They were just one of the world's biggest medication manufacturers for the last 40 years.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.640
 It was never that you think you were going to get a COVID vaccine

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.200
 - and you accidentally get a Viagra vaccine. - Imagine that.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.240
 We're all walking out with our arm in the air.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.200
 Like some Nazi rally.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:59.400
 Sorry, there's been a mix-up with our famous vaccine.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.880
 There's a thing called low-intensity shockwave therapy,

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.400
 which this is a proven thing that helps you if you have impotence problems.

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:11.400
 The physician will wave a wand over your penis,

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.400
 and the wand makes these tiny shockwaves, little kind of...

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.400
 What it sounds like is little clicks, like...

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:23.400
 - And what that will do, apparently... - Get it off!

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:28.400
 - I don't... - What's that flip-up thing? - Exactly!

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:33.400
 Apparently, it sounds a bit like a Newton's cradle, you know?

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.400
 - There's, like, that tie. - Yeah.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:40.400
 And it stimulates the blood vessels, and it helps you to be unimpetent.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.400
 - Free willy. - Wow.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:51.400
 Okay, that is it! That is all of our facts.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.400
