00:00:02,00:00:18,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:18,00:00:20,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish,"""
00:00:20,00:00:23,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live
00:00:23,00:00:25,from Nottingham!
00:00:25,00:00:28,(audience cheering)
00:00:28,00:00:31,(audience cheering)
00:00:31,00:00:35,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:35,00:00:38,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:38,00:00:40,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:40,00:00:42,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:42,00:00:45,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:45,00:00:49,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:49,00:00:53,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:00:53,00:00:56,"- My fact this week is that in 2015,"
00:00:56,00:00:59,paramedics in Australia stopped asking patients
00:00:59,00:01:02,to name the Prime Minister as a test of mental capacity.
00:01:02,00:01:03,(audience laughing)
00:01:03,00:01:05,"'Cause the answer changes so often,"
00:01:05,00:01:08,it's no longer considered a reliable indicator.
00:01:08,00:01:11,(audience laughing)
00:01:11,00:01:12,- That's amazing.
00:01:12,00:01:14,"- It's absolutely, and it's true, isn't it?"
00:01:14,00:01:17,Australia is constantly trading its PM.
00:01:17,00:01:20,"In fact, there's a Twitter account which is called @WhoIsPM,"
00:01:20,00:01:23,where it gives basically half-hourly updates
00:01:23,00:01:26,"going, ""It's still Scott Morrison."""
00:01:26,00:01:28,"- So what you're saying is if you're in some kind of problem,"
00:01:28,00:01:30,"the paramedics come along, you have to go,"
00:01:30,00:01:33,"""I'm just gonna need to go on Twitter really quick."""
00:01:33,00:01:34,"- They did say, I think the reason,"
00:01:34,00:01:36,"the particular paramedic who was interviewed,"
00:01:36,00:01:37,"and the article I read this in,"
00:01:37,00:01:39,the reason that he said he stopped doing it
00:01:39,00:01:41,was because he'd actually had a patient
00:01:41,00:01:43,"whom he'd asked, ""Who's the Prime Minister?"""
00:01:43,00:01:44,"And they just said, ""I don't know,"
00:01:44,00:01:46,"""I haven't watched the news today."""
00:01:46,00:01:46,So.
00:01:46,00:01:47,- Very nice.
00:01:47,00:01:49,"- That's a strong answer, isn't it?"
00:01:49,00:01:51,"- I didn't really know how crazy Australia,"
00:01:51,00:01:52,I don't know anything about Australian politics
00:01:52,00:01:53,before this.
00:01:53,00:01:55,"- So just to clarify it,"
00:01:55,00:01:58,there's this big thing of ousting your predecessor.
00:01:58,00:02:02,"So in 2010, Julia Gillard ousted Kevin Rudd,"
00:02:02,00:02:04,and that was really exciting after only three years.
00:02:04,00:02:07,"But then in 2013, Julia Gillard was ousted, guess who, by?"
00:02:07,00:02:08,By Kevin Rudd.
00:02:08,00:02:09,- Yeah.
00:02:09,00:02:12,"- Then in 2015, Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott,"
00:02:12,00:02:14,then Turnbull stayed on.
00:02:14,00:02:17,"And basically, there are so many PMs specifically"
00:02:17,00:02:18,in that short period.
00:02:18,00:02:20,"- Yeah, it was five PMs in five years"
00:02:20,00:02:22,if you count Rudd twice.
00:02:22,00:02:24,"- Which you could, 'cause many people say"
00:02:24,00:02:26,he's sort of got two different personalities.
00:02:26,00:02:28,"- Ooh, wow, wow, super."
00:02:28,00:02:30,- What's amazing is none of us in this room
00:02:30,00:02:32,"really know anything about him, but we all oued anyway."
00:02:32,00:02:34,"- It could have been worse, it could be worse."
00:02:34,00:02:35,"If you're in Nepal, for instance,"
00:02:35,00:02:37,"and you get caught in an accident,"
00:02:37,00:02:40,"since they became a democracy in 1951,"
00:02:40,00:02:43,they've had 53 changes of government.
00:02:43,00:02:44,"- Right, that's a lot."
00:02:44,00:02:44,- That's a lot.
00:02:44,00:02:45,"- Yeah, that stuff."
00:02:45,00:02:48,"Although if Australia kept up its won a year,"
00:02:48,00:02:50,"which it hasn't actually since 2015,"
00:02:50,00:02:52,"but you know, it would be beating Nepal."
00:02:52,00:02:54,- Who is the current Prime Minister?
00:02:54,00:02:55,- So that's Scott Morrison now.
00:02:55,00:02:56,It was Malcolm Turnbull.
00:02:56,00:02:58,"So they've had six and seven years,"
00:02:58,00:03:00,"which is quite good, five and five years."
00:03:00,00:03:02,"- So Scott Morrison, is he the one"
00:03:02,00:03:04,who shit himself in McDonald's?
00:03:04,00:03:05,- Sorry?
00:03:05,00:03:06,- What?
00:03:06,00:03:06,- Not familiar with this?
00:03:06,00:03:08,- I'm not sure.
00:03:08,00:03:10,"- I think that's what he's most famous for, isn't he?"
00:03:10,00:03:12,- I don't know if that's what he's most famous for
00:03:12,00:03:13,"in Australia, the country where he's Prime Minister."
00:03:13,00:03:15,"- He's Australian, I don't know."
00:03:15,00:03:17,"Every time, literally every time he goes on television,"
00:03:17,00:03:20,"he says, ""Oh, I'm gonna be on ABC tonight,"""
00:03:20,00:03:21,"and someone replies, ""Tell us about the time"
00:03:21,00:03:23,"""you shit yourself in McDonald's."""
00:03:23,00:03:26,- He's the Australian Paula Radcliffe.
00:03:26,00:03:27,Is that what we're saying?
00:03:27,00:03:28,- Yeah.
00:03:28,00:03:30,"Well, he is running a lot for Prime-"
00:03:30,00:03:31,- Hey!
00:03:31,00:03:32,"- Come on, guys."
00:03:32,00:03:33,- Top crowd tonight.
00:03:33,00:03:34,- Wow.
00:03:34,00:03:37,"- Aussie politics, it's just a bit more earthy and rude,"
00:03:37,00:03:38,isn't it?
00:03:38,00:03:39,"Genuinely, genuinely it is."
00:03:39,00:03:42,"It's quite, the stuff they say in Parliament"
00:03:42,00:03:43,is also really rude.
00:03:43,00:03:45,So I looked up unparliamentary language
00:03:45,00:03:46,from the Australian Parliament.
00:03:46,00:03:48,"And there is a lot, but there is a lot,"
00:03:48,00:03:51,especially if you include all the regional assemblies
00:03:51,00:03:52,"and things like that, list of things."
00:03:52,00:03:55,"I mean, they call each other nitwit, knucklehead, muppet."
00:03:55,00:03:56,- That's not that bad.
00:03:56,00:03:58,"- These are a bit mild, yeah, yeah."
00:03:58,00:04:00,"My question is to the village idiot, that was one."
00:04:00,00:04:03,- And they all answered.
00:04:03,00:04:06,"- Well, there's more."
00:04:06,00:04:09,"In 1994, one member of the Victoria House"
00:04:09,00:04:10,"said to another one,"
00:04:10,00:04:13,"""What is the difference between you and a bucket of shit?"""
00:04:13,00:04:16,"And the speaker rightly said, that's unparliamentary language,"
00:04:16,00:04:18,"and he said, ""I withdraw bucket."""
00:04:18,00:04:21,- Wow!
00:04:21,00:04:24,- It's had a long history of it.
00:04:24,00:04:27,Every Australian PM has an offensive nickname.
00:04:27,00:04:31,The first Australian Prime Minister was called Toby Tosspot.
00:04:31,00:04:32,- Really?
00:04:32,00:04:34,"- They named that pretty much straight away, yeah."
00:04:34,00:04:37,"He was Edmund Barton, and it was turn of the 20th century."
00:04:37,00:04:40,And Tosspot then was a term for someone who drank too much.
00:04:40,00:04:42,And Toby was just what people were called in.
00:04:42,00:04:43,- Like you toss a pot back.
00:04:43,00:04:44,- He could toss a pot back.
00:04:44,00:04:45,"- Toss a pot, 'cause a pot."
00:04:45,00:04:47,"- QI, when I first joined QI,"
00:04:47,00:04:51,"and I'm an Aussie, I should say, technically."
00:04:51,00:04:53,"- I wonder what village is missing there, idiot."
00:04:53,00:04:56,(audience laughs)
00:04:56,00:04:57,- I am Aussie.
00:04:57,00:04:59,"My dad's Aussie, and my grandmother's Aussie,"
00:04:59,00:05:02,and I lived there for my whole high school years.
00:05:02,00:05:04,"And when I moved to England, I moved to Oxford,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,"where I didn't go to university,"
00:05:06,00:05:07,"but QI was set up there,"
00:05:07,00:05:09,and there's a pub called the Turf Tavern.
00:05:09,00:05:11,"And in the Turf Tavern on the wall,"
00:05:11,00:05:14,"one of our Prime Ministers has an award,"
00:05:14,00:05:16,"a Guinness World Record, Bob Hawke,"
00:05:16,00:05:19,for downing the quickest yard of ale
00:05:19,00:05:21,that anyone has ever done.
00:05:21,00:05:24,"It was in 1954, it was two and a half pints,"
00:05:24,00:05:26,he did in 11 seconds.
00:05:26,00:05:28,"It's since been beaten, but for the rest of his life,"
00:05:28,00:05:31,"Bob Hawke, whenever he went to like cricket matches,"
00:05:31,00:05:33,"people would give him a big pint to be like,"
00:05:33,00:05:35,"oh, this is like a 70 year old man,"
00:05:35,00:05:39,"and he'd fucking down it, and such a champ."
00:05:39,00:05:41,"- I think my favourite Australian Prime Minister,"
00:05:41,00:05:43,"sorry, but was Tony Abbott,"
00:05:43,00:05:46,"who was in opposition when I lived there,"
00:05:46,00:05:49,and he's an entertaining man.
00:05:49,00:05:51,So he's very right wing Tony Abbott.
00:05:51,00:05:54,"He's done some wacky shit, so every Australian knows this,"
00:05:54,00:05:56,but it is worth watching if you haven't seen it.
00:05:56,00:05:59,"He went to visit an onion farm in Tasmania,"
00:05:59,00:06:02,"or an onion seller, a big onion selling company,"
00:06:02,00:06:03,"and the cameras were on,"
00:06:03,00:06:06,"and he was like, God, I won't do the accent."
00:06:06,00:06:08,"God, your produce is so great,"
00:06:08,00:06:11,"grabbed an onion, skin on, and just bit straight into it."
00:06:11,00:06:13,(audience laughing)
00:06:13,00:06:15,"Just chowed right down, was asked afterwards"
00:06:15,00:06:16,what he was doing.
00:06:16,00:06:18,"He said, people eat raw onion all the time."
00:06:18,00:06:19,"It's fine, salads, whatever."
00:06:19,00:06:22,"The skin wasn't on, the skin was on."
00:06:22,00:06:24,It's very clearly on.
00:06:24,00:06:24,- Wow.
00:06:24,00:06:26,- And then he did it again.
00:06:26,00:06:27,"A couple of months later,"
00:06:27,00:06:29,someone sent him a promotional pack of onions.
00:06:29,00:06:31,"He bit down on one again,"
00:06:31,00:06:34,then footage was on Earth of him eating a raw spring onion.
00:06:34,00:06:35,The man's got a problem.
00:06:35,00:06:38,"- All spring onions are eaten raw in salads, aren't they?"
00:06:38,00:06:40,"- Just on its own, from the floppy end."
00:06:40,00:06:41,"I mean, I think that's weird."
00:06:41,00:06:42,- I remember that.
00:06:42,00:06:42,- That is weird.
00:06:42,00:06:43,(audience laughing)
00:06:43,00:06:46,- I remember reading once that if you hold your nose
00:06:46,00:06:47,"and you bite an onion,"
00:06:47,00:06:50,"then you won't be able to, it'll taste like an apple."
00:06:50,00:06:52,And I tried that and it is not true.
00:06:52,00:06:55,(audience laughing)
00:06:55,00:06:57,- Maybe that's what he was testing out.
00:06:57,00:06:59,- The first woman to be elected in Australia
00:06:59,00:07:01,"was someone called Edith Cowan,"
00:07:01,00:07:05,"and she was, she won a seat in West Perth in 1921."
00:07:05,00:07:08,But she had to go home whenever she needed the toilet
00:07:08,00:07:10,'cause there was no female toilets.
00:07:10,00:07:11,"- Oh, wow."
00:07:11,00:07:13,"- Or to McDonald's and shit herself,"
00:07:13,00:07:14,I suppose it's possible.
00:07:14,00:07:15,(audience laughing)
00:07:15,00:07:16,- Did she live nearby?
00:07:16,00:07:18,"- Yeah, she lived around the corner."
00:07:18,00:07:19,- But even so.
00:07:19,00:07:20,"I don't, I'm not so, I'm not so..."
00:07:20,00:07:22,(audience laughing)
00:07:22,00:07:23,"She lived nearby, fine."
00:07:23,00:07:25,"There was one really cool thing in 2013,"
00:07:25,00:07:26,"that was an election in Australia,"
00:07:26,00:07:28,"as there were most years around then apparently,"
00:07:28,00:07:30,or oustings anyway.
00:07:30,00:07:32,The voting booths came with magnifying glasses.
00:07:32,00:07:33,- Oh yeah.
00:07:33,00:07:36,- Because there were 50 parties on the ballot paper.
00:07:36,00:07:37,"- Wow, wow."
00:07:37,00:07:38,- There were so many parties
00:07:38,00:07:40,that you had to be able to zoom in.
00:07:40,00:07:41,"So it's for, yeah."
00:07:41,00:07:42,- Wow.
00:07:42,00:07:43,- I know.
00:07:43,00:07:44,"- Was that the election where,"
00:07:44,00:07:45,"I think it was the lead up to that election,"
00:07:45,00:07:49,"where they postponed the Prime Ministerial Debate,"
00:07:49,00:07:50,"so much like us in Australia,"
00:07:50,00:07:54,they have the incumbent or the two candidates
00:07:54,00:07:55,"who are going to be Prime Minister before an election,"
00:07:55,00:07:57,"go up in debates, various television debates."
00:07:57,00:07:59,"And the last one, it's a massive deal."
00:07:59,00:08:00,"And it's the first time ever,"
00:08:00,00:08:03,"they moved it an hour forward, I think,"
00:08:03,00:08:05,because MasterChef was on.
00:08:05,00:08:06,(audience laughing)
00:08:06,00:08:07,- Wow.
00:08:07,00:08:08,"- Really, oh, it's big in Australia, yeah."
00:08:08,00:08:08,- It's good.
00:08:08,00:08:10,"- Do you like it? - MasterChef is good, yeah."
00:08:10,00:08:11,- That is pretty good.
00:08:11,00:08:13,- And they are better than the British MasterChef people.
00:08:13,00:08:17,"- Supposedly, the, oh, wow."
00:08:17,00:08:21,"Supposedly, the worst Prime Minister that has ever been"
00:08:21,00:08:23,in Australia is Billy McMahon.
00:08:23,00:08:26,"He had a bald pointy head with big ears,"
00:08:26,00:08:28,and one opponent said he looked like a Volkswagen
00:08:28,00:08:30,with both doors open.
00:08:30,00:08:32,(audience laughing)
00:08:32,00:08:35,He wasn't liked by even the people in his own cabinet.
00:08:35,00:08:38,"There was one guy who he worked with called Paul Hasluck,"
00:08:38,00:08:40,who referred to him as that treacherous bastard.
00:08:40,00:08:41,(audience laughing)
00:08:41,00:08:45,And the guy who was writing his potential autobiography
00:08:45,00:08:48,said that he is a third-rate politician
00:08:48,00:08:49,and that he could become PM.
00:08:49,00:08:52,It is a damning indictment on the country.
00:08:52,00:08:55,"Heart Troops lies, cheaper tracks."
00:08:55,00:08:57,What an unpleasant little turd.
00:08:57,00:08:58,(audience laughing)
00:08:58,00:09:00,"- Another, actually, Prime Minister"
00:09:00,00:09:01,"who's considered writing a book,"
00:09:01,00:09:03,"but apparently didn't get round to it,"
00:09:03,00:09:06,"is Malcolm Turnbull, who's the last Prime Minister but one."
00:09:06,00:09:08,And he considered finishing off
00:09:08,00:09:09,his mother's raunchy novel.
00:09:09,00:09:11,(audience laughing)
00:09:11,00:09:12,- Wow.
00:09:12,00:09:14,"- He actually, Malcolm Turnbull had kind of a sad childhood."
00:09:14,00:09:16,"He was very close to his dad,"
00:09:16,00:09:19,"who tragically died in a plane crash when he was quite young,"
00:09:19,00:09:20,but his mother was this academic
00:09:20,00:09:23,who'd run away with another man.
00:09:23,00:09:24,"And she went to America,"
00:09:24,00:09:29,"and while in America, so she was called something Lansbury,"
00:09:29,00:09:31,and she was a cousin of Angela Lansbury.
00:09:31,00:09:34,"And while she was in America, Angela Lansbury said to her,"
00:09:34,00:09:36,"""Mate, you gotta stop writing this dry,"
00:09:36,00:09:39,"""boring academic stuff and start writing some fun shit."""
00:09:39,00:09:42,"- Wait, so Angela, she's, is she murder she wrote?"
00:09:42,00:09:43,"- Do you know Angela Lansbury, right?"
00:09:43,00:09:44,"Yeah, murder she wrote."
00:09:44,00:09:47,"And anyway, yeah, she wrote a few raunchy novels,"
00:09:47,00:09:48,which sold quite well.
00:09:48,00:09:50,And then she died halfway through writing a novel called
00:09:50,00:09:52,"Opium, exclamation mark."
00:09:52,00:09:53,(audience laughing)
00:09:53,00:09:54,- Sounds like a musical.
00:09:54,00:09:55,"- It does, it does."
00:09:55,00:09:57,- Quite a sleepy musical.
00:09:57,00:09:59,"- Well, I think her son might still be working on it."
00:09:59,00:10:00,So now he's out of office.
00:10:00,00:10:02,"Maybe we'll get Opium, finally."
00:10:02,00:10:04,"- Malcolm Turnbull's podcast,"
00:10:04,00:10:06,"""My Mum Wrote a Porno,"" is gonna be..."
00:10:06,00:10:08,(audience laughing)
00:10:08,00:10:10,"Stone Cold Hit, I think."
00:10:10,00:10:13,"- On the test that you can get from people,"
00:10:13,00:10:15,"from paramedics, or another one is like,"
00:10:15,00:10:17,if you've been in a crash and they wanna check
00:10:17,00:10:19,"if you've been drinking, right?"
00:10:19,00:10:21,There was a thing with Tiger Woods a few months ago.
00:10:21,00:10:23,"Do you remember he was in a car crash,"
00:10:23,00:10:25,and they wanted to check if he'd been drinking?
00:10:25,00:10:26,"And so they said to him,"
00:10:26,00:10:28,"""Okay, Tiger, what you need to do"
00:10:28,00:10:31,"""is you need to say the alphabet forwards, not backwards."
00:10:31,00:10:33,"""You need to say the alphabet forwards,"
00:10:33,00:10:35,"""and you're not allowed to sing it."
00:10:35,00:10:37,"""So, Tiger, do you know what you have to do?"""
00:10:37,00:10:39,"And he said, ""Yes, I have to not sing"
00:10:39,00:10:41,"""the national anthem backwards."""
00:10:41,00:10:44,(audience laughing)
00:10:44,00:10:52,"- Queen Gracious, save, oh, God."
00:10:52,00:10:54,- You know he's American.
00:10:54,00:10:55,"- Yep, cool."
00:10:55,00:10:58,(audience laughing)
00:10:58,00:10:59,"- All right, we need to move on."
00:10:59,00:11:02,"Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:11:02,00:11:04,and that is my fact.
00:11:04,00:11:07,My fact this week is that three people
00:11:07,00:11:08,were recently hospitalized
00:11:08,00:11:12,after being hit by an iceberg at a Titanic Museum.
00:11:12,00:11:15,(audience laughing)
00:11:15,00:11:20,"So this is the Titanic Museum attraction,"
00:11:20,00:11:23,"which is in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee,"
00:11:23,00:11:26,and they have this giant ice wall
00:11:26,00:11:29,"inside of the attraction,"
00:11:29,00:11:32,"and it's 15 foot by 28 foot,"
00:11:32,00:11:34,"and it's sort of, it is actual real ice,"
00:11:34,00:11:36,"so visitors can actually touch it,"
00:11:36,00:11:39,"and it's grown using a sort of water filtration system,"
00:11:39,00:11:43,"and the whole thing just cracked and smashed down,"
00:11:43,00:11:46,"and it hurt people, and they were hospitalized,"
00:11:46,00:11:48,but I think-- - But they survived.
00:11:48,00:11:50,"- They survived. - Yeah, as in you're saying,"
00:11:50,00:11:51,the hearts will go on.
00:11:51,00:11:54,(audience laughing)
00:11:54,00:11:58,"- But yeah, I think it's time we don't put any ice"
00:11:58,00:12:00,near things called Titanic.
00:12:00,00:12:01,- Yeah.
00:12:01,00:12:04,"- It feels like, 'cause it happens a lot, doesn't it?"
00:12:04,00:12:06,"It's not just-- - I don't know how,"
00:12:06,00:12:08,"it's happened twice. - Oh, my God."
00:12:08,00:12:10,"It's happened more than twice,"
00:12:10,00:12:12,famously the first time it happened.
00:12:12,00:12:14,We've all heard of that one.
00:12:14,00:12:16,"2008, Carnegie Science Center,"
00:12:16,00:12:19,there was a Titanic exhibit that was in Pittsburgh.
00:12:19,00:12:22,"They had to temporarily close due to flooding,"
00:12:22,00:12:23,so that stopped them.
00:12:23,00:12:26,"There was a Titanic musical, which was in Southampton,"
00:12:26,00:12:29,which had to be stopped after the replica Titanic
00:12:29,00:12:32,"hit the iceberg, and plastic fell off the wall."
00:12:32,00:12:34,"That was the actual iceberg. - Oh, my goodness."
00:12:34,00:12:35,"- Yeah, and everyone, all the audience,"
00:12:35,00:12:37,"thought, ""Wow, that's an amazing effect,"""
00:12:37,00:12:38,"but then the crew ran out going,"
00:12:38,00:12:41,"""Stop the show!"" (audience laughing)"
00:12:41,00:12:43,"I read, and like, I haven't actually confirmed this,"
00:12:43,00:12:46,but there was another Titanic musical incident
00:12:46,00:12:49,where a burst pipe just exploded
00:12:49,00:12:52,"across the first three rows of the audience,"
00:12:52,00:12:54,"and everyone left angrily, and one person went,"
00:12:54,00:12:58,"""Wow, we truly experienced the sinking of the Titanic."""
00:12:58,00:13:00,(audience laughing)
00:13:00,00:13:02,- Need to confirm that one. - Makes you think.
00:13:02,00:13:02,- Wow. - Nice one.
00:13:02,00:13:05,You can really empathize with those figures from history.
00:13:05,00:13:07,"Well, there was even in 1898,"
00:13:07,00:13:10,"a Titan ship that hit an iceberg and sank,"
00:13:10,00:13:12,"which was a fictional ship, but a novel was written."
00:13:12,00:13:15,"In 1898, by a guy called Morgan Robertson,"
00:13:15,00:13:16,"it was called ""Futility,"""
00:13:16,00:13:18,"starring a ship called Titan,"
00:13:18,00:13:20,and it had been built in Britain.
00:13:20,00:13:21,It was sailing to America.
00:13:21,00:13:23,"It was going too fast, hits an iceberg,"
00:13:23,00:13:26,"not enough lifeboats, half the crew die."
00:13:26,00:13:28,"- Yeah, gosh. - In 1898."
00:13:28,00:13:30,- Very depressing. - There are a few details
00:13:30,00:13:31,that are slightly different.
00:13:31,00:13:33,"It also involves in the plot,"
00:13:33,00:13:35,the boat cuts another boat in half
00:13:35,00:13:37,"while plowing through to the iceberg,"
00:13:37,00:13:39,"and yeah, it just cuts one in half."
00:13:39,00:13:41,It's about this massive boat that's so huge
00:13:41,00:13:43,it leaves other boats in its midst.
00:13:43,00:13:45,It's sort of like a monster boat.
00:13:45,00:13:47,"And then when it crashes,"
00:13:47,00:13:50,"the hero almost goes down with the ship,"
00:13:50,00:13:52,but thankfully he survives.
00:13:52,00:13:54,I believe ends up on the iceberg
00:13:54,00:13:57,and manages to rescue the young child
00:13:57,00:13:59,of the woman he fancies from a polar bear
00:13:59,00:14:01,who's trying to eat him.
00:14:01,00:14:02,"- Oh, okay. - So..."
00:14:02,00:14:03,- So some of it is also...
00:14:03,00:14:04,"Yeah, that's close, yeah, yeah."
00:14:04,00:14:06,"- Apparently the V&A Museum,"
00:14:06,00:14:08,"they did a Titanic exhibit,"
00:14:08,00:14:10,"and apparently this book, ""Titan,"""
00:14:10,00:14:13,was on the Titanic as part of the reading library.
00:14:13,00:14:16,"- Apparently. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:14:16,00:14:17,- Just quickly on Titanic.
00:14:17,00:14:19,So it was called the RMS Titanic.
00:14:19,00:14:21,Do you know what RMS stands for?
00:14:21,00:14:22,- Royal Mail... No.
00:14:22,00:14:24,"- It's Royal Mail Steamer, okay?"
00:14:24,00:14:26,'Cause it was a postal ship as well.
00:14:26,00:14:29,"There were 3,000 bags of post on board,"
00:14:29,00:14:30,"but the postal workers,"
00:14:30,00:14:32,"when they found out that the ship was flooding,"
00:14:32,00:14:35,they tried moving 200 sacks of registered mail
00:14:35,00:14:37,to the upper decks of the ship.
00:14:37,00:14:38,"- Oh, really?"
00:14:38,00:14:39,"- They forced several stewards to help them,"
00:14:39,00:14:41,"saying, ""Look, this is the registered stuff."
00:14:41,00:14:42,"""This is important."""
00:14:42,00:14:44,"They were told not to bother, but they kept going."
00:14:44,00:14:48,- I always get confused about when a disaster's happening.
00:14:48,00:14:50,"If there's staff members work in a place,"
00:14:50,00:14:52,"they're like dedicated to their job,"
00:14:52,00:14:53,"to the point of like,"
00:14:53,00:14:55,"""We've got to play the music till the ship goes down."
00:14:55,00:14:56,"""We've got to bring the mail up."""
00:14:56,00:14:58,"Guys, if there's a fire here tonight,"
00:14:58,00:15:00,"I'm fucking off straight away, right?"
00:15:00,00:15:03,"I am not being like, ""Get the audience out!"""
00:15:03,00:15:04,No.
00:15:04,00:15:07,- Do you guys know about Clive Palmer's
00:15:07,00:15:10,"giant Titanic replica, right?"
00:15:10,00:15:13,Clive Palmer is an Australian billionaire.
00:15:13,00:15:14,He's an Australian billionaire.
00:15:14,00:15:15,He's an eccentric.
00:15:15,00:15:17,"He wants to make Titanic too,"
00:15:17,00:15:19,"and he's been promising it for ages,"
00:15:19,00:15:21,"and it will be a cruise ship by his company,"
00:15:21,00:15:22,"the Blue Star Line,"
00:15:22,00:15:25,and it will take the same route as Titanic.
00:15:25,00:15:28,"I mean, I don't know why he thinks people would go on this,"
00:15:28,00:15:30,"but then it's completely recreated inside,"
00:15:30,00:15:31,"and he's been promising it for a long time,"
00:15:31,00:15:35,and sort of the project keeps having various issues.
00:15:35,00:15:36,"Anyway, it's been moved to Europe."
00:15:36,00:15:38,"The project was gonna be based in Britain,"
00:15:38,00:15:39,"because of Brexit, I'm afraid."
00:15:39,00:15:40,"It's now based in France,"
00:15:40,00:15:43,"and the, yeah, well,"
00:15:43,00:15:45,"if you want Titanic too, don't leave the EU."
00:15:45,00:15:48,- If only that was on the side of a bus.
00:15:48,00:15:52,"- Unfortunately, it was painted on the side"
00:15:52,00:15:54,"of an enormous ship, which then sank."
00:15:54,00:15:56,(audience laughing)
00:15:56,00:15:59,But the project director in Europe
00:15:59,00:16:01,"is the director of this whole Titanic project,"
00:16:01,00:16:04,"is his nephew, who's called Clive Mencink."
00:16:04,00:16:06,"- Wow, really?"
00:16:06,00:16:08,"- Yeah, it's doomed."
00:16:08,00:16:10,- Some other stuff on other weird things
00:16:10,00:16:11,that have happened in museums.
00:16:11,00:16:12,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:12,00:16:14,- This was in Denmark.
00:16:14,00:16:18,"I was reading about an artist called Jens Haening,"
00:16:18,00:16:21,and what they did was they commissioned him to do this work.
00:16:21,00:16:25,"They were gonna give him 534,000 kroner,"
00:16:25,00:16:26,"and what he was gonna do,"
00:16:26,00:16:29,"he was gonna put it in a huge sort of art installation,"
00:16:29,00:16:31,and it would be a picture of something.
00:16:31,00:16:32,"They didn't know what it was gonna be,"
00:16:32,00:16:34,and that was the average amount of money
00:16:34,00:16:37,that a Danish person earns in a year.
00:16:37,00:16:39,"Anyway, so he went away,"
00:16:39,00:16:42,"and then he came back with a complete empty canvas,"
00:16:42,00:16:46,and it was an artwork that he called Take the Money and Run.
00:16:46,00:16:48,(audience laughing)
00:16:48,00:16:49,- So good.
00:16:50,00:16:53,"- Did they take that in the good human spirit,"
00:16:53,00:16:54,which he hoped they would?
00:16:54,00:16:56,"- The guy who runs a museum said,"
00:16:56,00:16:58,"""He stirred up my curatorial staff,"
00:16:58,00:17:00,"""and he also stirred me up a bit,"
00:17:00,00:17:04,"""but I also had a laugh 'cause it was really humoristic."""
00:17:04,00:17:06,But then he did say that he needs to pay the money back.
00:17:06,00:17:08,(audience laughing)
00:17:08,00:17:11,"- I really like incidents of museums,"
00:17:11,00:17:12,"you just, you know, making flubs and blunders"
00:17:12,00:17:14,and accidentally ruining exhibits and things like that.
00:17:14,00:17:16,"So the National History Museum,"
00:17:16,00:17:19,they released a list of their incidents in 2009.
00:17:19,00:17:22,"One of them, slightly shortly before that,"
00:17:22,00:17:25,"was there were these things called conodonts,"
00:17:25,00:17:29,"which are their extinct eel-like creatures, okay?"
00:17:29,00:17:30,"They had 22 of them,"
00:17:30,00:17:33,and they were accidentally knocked over and then hoovered up.
00:17:33,00:17:35,(audience laughing)
00:17:35,00:17:36,"Which I just, I like."
00:17:36,00:17:38,- Did they retrieve them from the back?
00:17:38,00:17:39,"- No, I don't think so."
00:17:39,00:17:40,"- Why? - Oh, shit."
00:17:40,00:17:40,"- Well, I think they were ruined"
00:17:40,00:17:42,in the process of being hoovered up.
00:17:42,00:17:42,I think that's not--
00:17:42,00:17:44,"- Oh, they're just a bit fluffy."
00:17:44,00:17:44,"- Yeah, exactly. - Sorry."
00:17:44,00:17:47,- Just wipe that off. (laughing)
00:17:47,00:17:48,"- There was, there was an art gallery"
00:17:48,00:17:51,"that had a exhibition,"
00:17:51,00:17:52,"I can't remember, I can't remember what it was,"
00:17:52,00:17:56,"but it was an exhibition that showed lots of like,"
00:17:56,00:17:57,"remnants from a party,"
00:17:57,00:17:59,kind of cigarette butts and empty beer bottles
00:17:59,00:18:01,"and, you know, stuff strewn around,"
00:18:01,00:18:03,and the cleaner cleaned it all up in the morning.
00:18:03,00:18:04,"- Yeah, that happens a bunch, yeah."
00:18:04,00:18:07,Like Damien Hirst had one where the garbage was carried.
00:18:07,00:18:09,"There was one where there was a garbage bag,"
00:18:09,00:18:12,"and they took it away and they apologized,"
00:18:12,00:18:13,"and he was like, ""That's fine."""
00:18:13,00:18:14,He just gave another garbage bag.
00:18:14,00:18:16,"- Yeah, I'm sure I must have said it on here before,"
00:18:16,00:18:20,"but the time I went to an art gallery in Barcelona,"
00:18:20,00:18:22,"and there was someone collapsed in the corner,"
00:18:22,00:18:23,"and I ran to the front and said,"
00:18:23,00:18:25,"""Oh, does someone collapse in the corner of that room?"""
00:18:25,00:18:27,"And they went, ""No sir, that is part of the exhibit."""
00:18:27,00:18:28,(laughing)
00:18:28,00:18:29,"And it was just a doll,"
00:18:29,00:18:31,"and I said, ""Oh, that must happen all the time."""
00:18:31,00:18:32,"And he went, ""Nope."""
00:18:32,00:18:34,(laughing)
00:18:34,00:18:37,"- It happens so much,"
00:18:37,00:18:38,"but it does happen with specific works of art,"
00:18:38,00:18:39,like either someone collapsed
00:18:39,00:18:42,or just something that is designed to look like rubbish.
00:18:42,00:18:45,"So there was a, in 2011 there was an artwork"
00:18:45,00:18:46,which featured a bathtub
00:18:46,00:18:49,"with a sort of thick, scummy line around the inside,"
00:18:49,00:18:51,and that was scrubbed by an overzealous
00:18:51,00:18:53,member of cleaning staff.
00:18:53,00:18:54,- Did she not wonder why there was a bath
00:18:54,00:18:55,in the middle of the gallery?
00:18:55,00:18:59,"- Exactly, I think that's a fair cop, actually."
00:18:59,00:19:01,"But there's an article called Joseph Buys,"
00:19:01,00:19:05,"B-E-U-Y-S, Buys, who had not Buys."
00:19:05,00:19:08,"What a fun, oh, I mean, never stop saying that name."
00:19:08,00:19:09,- It's all about the Buys.
00:19:09,00:19:10,(laughing)
00:19:10,00:19:14,"- He had an artwork which was a grease stain,"
00:19:14,00:19:16,and that was unsurprisingly scrubbed.
00:19:16,00:19:18,And it wasn't the first time it had happened to him.
00:19:18,00:19:21,"He also had a baby bathtub in 1973 on display,"
00:19:21,00:19:23,which was wrapped in gauze and bandages.
00:19:23,00:19:25,So baby bathtub wrapped up.
00:19:25,00:19:28,"Anyway, two cleaners just took it to wash the dishes in,"
00:19:28,00:19:30,'cause they thought this cannot possibly be a work of art.
00:19:30,00:19:31,"- Oh, really?"
00:19:31,00:19:32,- Yeah.
00:19:32,00:19:33,- I feel like all the stories involved cleaners
00:19:33,00:19:34,"fucking stuff up, and we need to maybe--"
00:19:34,00:19:36,"- A lot of blame on the cleaners,"
00:19:36,00:19:37,"a lot of blame on the cleaners, yeah."
00:19:37,00:19:38,"- Yeah, we need to have a conversation"
00:19:38,00:19:40,"with the cleaners at museums saying,"
00:19:40,00:19:43,you see all the random fucking shit here?
00:19:43,00:19:44,It's meant to be easier if you're at
00:19:44,00:19:46,"the National Portrait Gallery, isn't it?"
00:19:46,00:19:48,"It's much, much easier to tell what's art"
00:19:48,00:19:50,and what isn't at the National Portrait Gallery.
00:19:50,00:19:51,- That's true.
00:19:51,00:19:52,- 'Cause it's a portrait.
00:19:52,00:19:53,- Exactly.
00:19:53,00:19:55,- You're not gonna see a picture of someone's face
00:19:55,00:19:56,"and go, I'm just gonna rub that off."
00:19:56,00:19:57,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:19:57,00:19:59,- Just gonna get rid of Rembrandt's mole.
00:19:59,00:20:00,Hang on.
00:20:00,00:20:03,"- Macron, the president of France,"
00:20:03,00:20:05,"he did a report in 2018,"
00:20:05,00:20:09,and he found that 90 to 95% of Sub-Saharan Africa's
00:20:09,00:20:13,"cultural heritage was held in museums outside of Africa, okay?"
00:20:13,00:20:15,So pretty much all of it's been taken out of Africa.
00:20:15,00:20:19,"And so there's a guy called Mwazulu Diabanza,"
00:20:19,00:20:21,"who is an artist, and he's decided"
00:20:21,00:20:23,he's just gonna go to museums and steal it back.
00:20:23,00:20:24,- Cool.
00:20:24,00:20:26,- And so he basically goes around.
00:20:26,00:20:32,"So he goes around all these museums in France,"
00:20:32,00:20:34,"and he'll just kind of walk in and see,"
00:20:34,00:20:36,"oh, there's an ivory spear there that was from Congo,"
00:20:36,00:20:39,and he'll just go in and walk out and walk straight out with it.
00:20:39,00:20:42,"Occasionally, he did want to steal a sculpture"
00:20:42,00:20:44,that was actually from Indonesia.
00:20:44,00:20:44,"- Okay, right."
00:20:44,00:20:46,"- There was a bit of a mistake,"
00:20:46,00:20:48,but obviously he's been arrested from time to time.
00:20:48,00:20:51,"But this lawyer said, I don't know of any thief"
00:20:51,00:20:54,"who turns up to a museum and says, film me."
00:20:54,00:20:57,"And then, having been filmed stealing the article,"
00:20:57,00:20:58,puts it back.
00:20:58,00:21:00,So he doesn't put it back afterwards.
00:21:00,00:21:02,"- Oh, well that doesn't work out."
00:21:02,00:21:05,"- I thought he was like a reverse Indiana Jones, you know?"
00:21:05,00:21:07,That doesn't belong in a museum.
00:21:07,00:21:09,"That's the line from the third film, it doesn't matter."
00:21:09,00:21:12,- And then what is he chasing after a massive ball?
00:21:12,00:21:15,"- He, yeah, that's right."
00:21:15,00:21:17,"He actually, he puts his hat into a room"
00:21:17,00:21:20,just as there's a wall about to crush him.
00:21:20,00:21:22,"Yeah, it's very exciting."
00:21:22,00:21:25,"- Just on injuries in museums, which this is about,"
00:21:25,00:21:28,"there's a man who's suing Melbourne Science Works,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,"Science Museum in Melbourne,"
00:21:30,00:21:33,for an exhibit they have where they have
00:21:33,00:21:35,"a virtual sprinter, Kathy Freeman,"
00:21:35,00:21:37,"Olympic medal-winning sprinter,"
00:21:37,00:21:40,and they encourage you to race against her
00:21:40,00:21:42,on a 10-meter track.
00:21:42,00:21:45,And what they have done is they've put the 10-meter track
00:21:45,00:21:49,"immediately in front of a wall, a quite solid wall."
00:21:49,00:21:51,(audience laughing)
00:21:51,00:21:54,"And he's suing them because he's broken two vertebrae,"
00:21:54,00:21:55,"another bone and a rib,"
00:21:55,00:21:58,and lost the feeling in his arms and hand
00:21:58,00:22:01,because he ran headlong into a wall.
00:22:01,00:22:02,- Oh my God.
00:22:02,00:22:04,There's a French museum that was gonna hold an exhibition
00:22:04,00:22:07,about Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire.
00:22:07,00:22:09,But they were told by the Chinese government
00:22:09,00:22:10,that they could only have the stuff
00:22:10,00:22:13,"if they didn't mention the words empire, Mongol, Genghis,"
00:22:13,00:22:14,or Khan.
00:22:14,00:22:17,(audience laughing)
00:22:17,00:22:21,"- All right, we need to move on to our next fact of the show,"
00:22:21,00:22:25,"and that is fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:22:25,00:22:28,- My fact is that there are nine hammocks on the moon.
00:22:28,00:22:31,- Who's using them?
00:22:31,00:22:34,"- Also, like no trees."
00:22:34,00:22:35,"- Yes, what a good point."
00:22:35,00:22:39,There are nine tragically unopened hammocks on the moon.
00:22:39,00:22:42,"This is from a book called ""An Answer for Everything."""
00:22:42,00:22:45,One of the pages is about everything there is on the moon.
00:22:45,00:22:47,"One of the things is, loads and loads of hammocks"
00:22:47,00:22:52,"because Apollo 11, the first man landing on the moon,"
00:22:52,00:22:56,"they slept really badly, they slept appallingly,"
00:22:56,00:22:58,and they just got a terrible night's sleep
00:22:58,00:22:59,when they were there.
00:22:59,00:23:01,"- Well, it was sort of, so yeah, they were in the lander"
00:23:01,00:23:03,"and they didn't really think of that,"
00:23:03,00:23:05,"and it's so crowded, so Buzz Aldrin, I think,"
00:23:05,00:23:08,"was basically laying on the floor as if he was just,"
00:23:08,00:23:09,"you know, like you would if you were drunk"
00:23:09,00:23:11,and you got home and couldn't find the bed.
00:23:11,00:23:14,"That was him, and they thought we need to sort that."
00:23:14,00:23:18,"- Yeah, absolutely, so they, when Apollo 12 to 17"
00:23:18,00:23:20,"flew with more man missions to the moon,"
00:23:20,00:23:22,they had these specially designed lunar hammocks
00:23:22,00:23:24,"that would go in the lander, and when you come back,"
00:23:24,00:23:26,"you can't bring all your stuff with you,"
00:23:26,00:23:29,so they just left the hammocks behind.
00:23:29,00:23:31,"- And so, yeah, and it's amazing to think about it"
00:23:31,00:23:33,"because they would land on the moon,"
00:23:33,00:23:35,and then they would set their hammocks up
00:23:35,00:23:38,"in a sort of X shape, so one lower and one above,"
00:23:38,00:23:40,"and that's, they would just lay in it and just--"
00:23:40,00:23:42,"- And this is not on the moon, we should say,"
00:23:42,00:23:42,"this is inside the lander, right?"
00:23:42,00:23:45,"- Inside the lander on the moon, though."
00:23:45,00:23:47,"That is how they slept, like they were on"
00:23:47,00:23:49,"some sort of desert island, but the problem was,"
00:23:49,00:23:51,and the problem for a lot of these missions was
00:23:51,00:23:54,"the adrenaline is so great, you're on the fucking moon,"
00:23:54,00:23:55,"you're not going to sleep, right?"
00:23:55,00:23:56,"- Well, so--"
00:23:56,00:23:57,"- And when Armstrong and Aldrin landed,"
00:23:57,00:23:59,they were scheduled to have a nap.
00:23:59,00:24:00,- Yeah.
00:24:00,00:24:02,"- And the mission control said, right, you're on the moon,"
00:24:02,00:24:05,"off to bed you go, and they said, absolutely not."
00:24:05,00:24:08,"We would like to go on to the moon now, please."
00:24:08,00:24:11,"- You know how, like, at nighttime, the moon comes out?"
00:24:11,00:24:12,"If you're on the moon, does it always kind of"
00:24:12,00:24:14,"feel like nighttime, or--"
00:24:14,00:24:15,- Good question.
00:24:15,00:24:15,- Do you think you'd just be really sleepy
00:24:15,00:24:16,the whole time?
00:24:16,00:24:19,"- I think I would, yeah, just naturally."
00:24:19,00:24:22,"- Apollo 14, unfortunately, where they landed"
00:24:22,00:24:26,"with Apollo 14 was on a seven degree slant,"
00:24:26,00:24:28,"so the lander was just slightly tipping,"
00:24:28,00:24:31,"which freaked the shit out of the astronauts inside,"
00:24:31,00:24:33,"so they couldn't get to sleep,"
00:24:33,00:24:34,"because any time they heard a noise,"
00:24:34,00:24:36,"they thought we're about to tip over,"
00:24:36,00:24:39,and you can read the actual transcripts
00:24:39,00:24:42,"of what they were chatting about, so one transcript goes,"
00:24:42,00:24:43,"and this is while they were trying to sleep, I think,"
00:24:43,00:24:47,"they go, Ed, did you hear that?"
00:24:47,00:24:50,"He goes, hell yes, I heard that."
00:24:50,00:24:52,What the hell was that?
00:24:52,00:24:54,I don't know.
00:24:54,00:24:56,"Ed, what?"
00:24:56,00:24:58,Why the hell are we whispering?
00:24:58,00:25:01,(audience laughing)
00:25:01,00:25:04,"But they couldn't go to sleep, they were so worried about,"
00:25:04,00:25:07,"so that didn't happen, and then slowly Apollo 15,"
00:25:07,00:25:08,"and 16, it got better and better."
00:25:08,00:25:11,- I think mainly they had to make it better
00:25:11,00:25:13,"for Apollo 15, because that was the first time"
00:25:13,00:25:15,they'd stayed on the moon any length of time
00:25:15,00:25:17,"that required sleep, they were there for three nights,"
00:25:17,00:25:19,"and they had to do proper stuff on the moon,"
00:25:19,00:25:22,"like collect loads of samples, and drive,"
00:25:22,00:25:25,you can't drive when you're sleep deprived.
00:25:25,00:25:27,"It was the first time they had a car on the moon,"
00:25:27,00:25:28,"and so they got proper hammocks,"
00:25:28,00:25:29,and I think they solved it
00:25:29,00:25:32,"by basically letting them take their space suits off, right?"
00:25:32,00:25:33,It was the first time that they'd allowed them
00:25:33,00:25:37,to go back into the lunar lander and actually strip down
00:25:37,00:25:40,so that you can adopt a comfortable position.
00:25:40,00:25:43,- And I suppose the reason that the hammocks are on the moon
00:25:43,00:25:45,is because you need to get rid of all your stuff
00:25:45,00:25:47,"when you're gonna take off again,"
00:25:47,00:25:48,"'cause it needs to be as light as possible, right?"
00:25:48,00:25:49,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:25:49,00:25:51,- So I was speaking to this morning
00:25:51,00:25:52,"to someone called Beth O'Leary,"
00:25:52,00:25:56,"who pretty much invented something called space archeology,"
00:25:56,00:25:59,"she's a scientist, and she said that basically"
00:25:59,00:26:02,"when Apollo 11 came down at least,"
00:26:02,00:26:05,"for about eight minutes, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong"
00:26:05,00:26:07,stood on the corner of their lunar module
00:26:07,00:26:09,and just threw anything out that they didn't need.
00:26:09,00:26:11,"They just threw it all out, we don't need this,"
00:26:11,00:26:13,"we don't need that, we don't need the other."
00:26:13,00:26:14,"- That's a steering wheel, Buzz, I'll get it."
00:26:14,00:26:16,"I'm sorry, I think I heard Miss Ellis."
00:26:16,00:26:19,"- In archeology, apparently that is called a toss zone."
00:26:19,00:26:23,"- It's 'cause they fill the thing with rocks, right?"
00:26:23,00:26:25,"- Yes, yes. - So weird going,"
00:26:25,00:26:28,dumping all the useful stuff and just filling it up
00:26:28,00:26:30,"with rocks for the way back, but..."
00:26:30,00:26:31,"- They did leave some things,"
00:26:31,00:26:32,"which now NASA would like to look at,"
00:26:32,00:26:34,but NASA would only like to look at them
00:26:34,00:26:37,"because they left them there, if you see what I mean."
00:26:37,00:26:39,"So bags of poo, basically. - Yes."
00:26:39,00:26:42,"- Bags of poo, urine, and vomit."
00:26:42,00:26:44,There are 96 bags of all of this stuff
00:26:44,00:26:46,"on the surface of the moon still today,"
00:26:46,00:26:48,and NASA is fascinated to know what's happened
00:26:48,00:26:50,biologically with them and what has lasted
00:26:50,00:26:53,and what hasn't and what they could tell from it.
00:26:53,00:26:55,"And so if they go back to the moon,"
00:26:55,00:26:58,"if there's another crewed mission to the moon coming up soon,"
00:26:58,00:27:00,it is possible that one of their jobs
00:27:00,00:27:02,"will be finding bags of poo,"
00:27:02,00:27:04,just doing a pooper scoop on the moon.
00:27:04,00:27:06,"- The truth is that it's not just that,"
00:27:06,00:27:07,it's everything that they left there.
00:27:07,00:27:11,"They want it to be like kept as it is, right?"
00:27:11,00:27:13,Because let's say Elon Musk goes up there
00:27:13,00:27:14,for a party or something.
00:27:14,00:27:16,What they don't want is him kind of knocking over
00:27:16,00:27:19,all the flags and all the poo and all the hammocks and stuff.
00:27:19,00:27:21,They want it all to be as it is.
00:27:21,00:27:26,"And so this year, actually the 31st of December last year,"
00:27:26,00:27:28,the US enacted the One Small Step
00:27:28,00:27:31,"to Protect Human Heritage and Space Act,"
00:27:31,00:27:34,which made it illegal to touch anything on the moon
00:27:34,00:27:35,that the humans have left there.
00:27:35,00:27:37,"And it was really, really controversial"
00:27:37,00:27:40,"because by law, no one owns the moon,"
00:27:40,00:27:43,"no one owns any of the land on there,"
00:27:43,00:27:46,but America owns the objects that are on the land.
00:27:46,00:27:48,And so it was really dodgy.
00:27:48,00:27:51,"The Soviets, sorry, the Russians really didn't want."
00:27:51,00:27:52,(LAUGHTER)
00:27:52,00:27:55,"I think you've made your allegiances very clear there, James."
00:27:55,00:27:57,(LAUGHTER)
00:27:57,00:28:00,But they didn't really want the Americans to have this kind of law
00:28:00,00:28:03,"saying no one can touch this area because, well, it doesn't belong to you."
00:28:03,00:28:06,Who are you to say who touched it and who doesn't touch it?
00:28:06,00:28:07,"And even more than that,"
00:28:07,00:28:10,"if you look at the footprints of Neil Armstrong, for instance,"
00:28:10,00:28:13,"theoretically, America owns the footprints,"
00:28:13,00:28:16,but they don't own any of the dust which creates the footprint.
00:28:16,00:28:19,They're in the space directly above that dust.
00:28:19,00:28:23,"Yeah, they own the concept of the footprint, but not what makes it."
00:28:23,00:28:24,Yeah.
00:28:24,00:28:27,"Wow, the cleaners are going to have an absolute nightmare"
00:28:27,00:28:29,when they turn up to the moon.
00:28:29,00:28:32,Which bit of this is the party and which bit is debris preserved?
00:28:32,00:28:33,(LAUGHTER)
00:28:33,00:28:37,"It's amazing that I hadn't thought of that, that in theory,"
00:28:37,00:28:40,"Neil Armstrong's one small step for man,"
00:28:40,00:28:42,"that one small step is still there, right?"
00:28:42,00:28:43,"Possibly, yeah."
00:28:43,00:28:45,"Possibly because it was right at the bottom of the ladder,"
00:28:45,00:28:47,"so Buzz might have landed and just smudged it out immediately, pissed off."
00:28:47,00:28:50,"Very likely, Buzz was here, right next to it."
00:28:50,00:28:55,"But like, the last thing that was left by an astronaut on the moon"
00:28:55,00:29:00,"wasn't a physical object, but it was the last astronaut who was there"
00:29:00,00:29:03,"who wrote, like you would in The Sand at a Beach,"
00:29:03,00:29:07,"wrote the letters TDC, and that was the initials of his daughter,"
00:29:07,00:29:10,"and that was Eugene Cernan, the last person to stand on the moon."
00:29:10,00:29:14,"And in theory, unless that bit of the moon is hit by, you know,"
00:29:14,00:29:16,"space rocks and so on,"
00:29:16,00:29:20,"that's going to be there for at least, you know, 50,000 years."
00:29:20,00:29:23,"Well, because there's not the same kind of atmosphere on the moon"
00:29:23,00:29:24,to mess it up.
00:29:24,00:29:28,"So in theory, Neil's footprint, if Buzz managed to sort of, like,"
00:29:28,00:29:32,"do a wide berth with his landing, is still there, which is amazing."
00:29:32,00:29:38,"There is 100 metric tons of human material on the moon, man-made,"
00:29:38,00:29:42,"which, if you can imagine there being a massive mirror in front of a theatre"
00:29:42,00:29:46,"somewhere in the, you know, Midlands of England,"
00:29:46,00:29:50,it would be approximately 10 times the weight of that thing.
00:29:50,00:29:54,That's going to mean a lot to all the listeners at home.
00:29:54,00:29:59,It's also going to be confusing when James boosts that laugh in the edit.
00:29:59,00:30:02,Here's one thing you can get if you go to the moon.
00:30:02,00:30:04,The secret to David Copperfield's magic tricks.
00:30:04,00:30:07,"No! Yes, they are on the moon now."
00:30:07,00:30:11,"There was this private mission, there was a crash on the moon in 2019,"
00:30:11,00:30:14,"which I can't believe we didn't, more wasn't made of it,"
00:30:14,00:30:17,"there was a private spacecraft called Beresheet, and it had a disk on it."
00:30:17,00:30:22,"It had a sort of human library, which had Wikipedia, had thousands of books,"
00:30:22,00:30:26,and one of the other things on it was the technical illustrations and diagrams
00:30:26,00:30:28,for David Copperfield's magic tricks.
00:30:28,00:30:30,"It's not certain that it survived, but it was in a really well,"
00:30:30,00:30:34,"it wasn't just a DVD, it was a 25-layer sandwich of metal and resin,"
00:30:34,00:30:38,"it was really well protected, and so it is possible it is surviving there."
00:30:38,00:30:41,And Copperfield said he was so inspired by the idea of the mission
00:30:41,00:30:43,that he wanted to give away secrets.
00:30:43,00:30:45,"I mean, when aliens get there and find that,"
00:30:45,00:30:48,they're not going to have the saw or the box to put the woman in.
00:30:48,00:30:51,Or even the woman to put in the box.
00:30:51,00:30:55,"Another thing on the moon, a bunch of flags, as we know,"
00:30:55,00:30:59,"very controversial at the time, whether to erect an American flag on the moon."
00:30:59,00:31:04,"So when Apollo 11 first went there, there was this big debate in the US,"
00:31:04,00:31:08,"because it was that post-colonial era when everyone was saying,"
00:31:08,00:31:11,"""That was really bad,"" where we stamped our flags in countries that weren't ours"
00:31:11,00:31:13,"and claimed that they were, ""Let's not do that again."""
00:31:13,00:31:16,"And so they said, ""Okay, we probably shouldn't put an American flag there,"
00:31:16,00:31:18,"'cause it's like we're claiming it."""
00:31:18,00:31:21,"And then there was a suggestion, which they seriously considered and almost did,"
00:31:21,00:31:25,"to instead bring up a miniature flag for every country on Earth,"
00:31:25,00:31:27,for them to put into the soil at once.
00:31:27,00:31:28,A little village.
00:31:28,00:31:31,A little village.
00:31:31,00:31:33,It's so sad they didn't have 160 tiny flags.
00:31:33,00:31:36,"I think it was a relief, 'cause it sounded like a real arseake"
00:31:36,00:31:38,hammering the one flag in.
00:31:38,00:31:38,"Right, really."
00:31:38,00:31:41,"So what do you do when, for instance, South Sudan?"
00:31:41,00:31:43,The South Sudan problem.
00:31:43,00:31:44,You've got to go back.
00:31:44,00:31:48,"Every time there's a new country, you have to go back."
00:31:48,00:31:50,Please don't divide into two countries.
00:31:50,00:31:52,It's going to be so expensive for NASA.
00:31:52,00:31:54,There already is.
00:31:54,00:31:58,"Not a model village, but a model something on the moon."
00:31:58,00:31:58,There's a model.
00:31:58,00:32:02,"It's a miniature art gallery, which is very exciting."
00:32:02,00:32:02,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:02,00:32:06,"It's called the Moon Museum, and an artist called Forrest Myers"
00:32:06,00:32:08,commissioned artworks from six different artists
00:32:08,00:32:11,"to draw tiny, tiny drawings."
00:32:11,00:32:14,"And the engineer, at NASA, he gave it to,"
00:32:14,00:32:17,says that he stuck it onto the leg of the lunar module.
00:32:17,00:32:18,So it's there.
00:32:18,00:32:19,"There's no confirmation it's there,"
00:32:19,00:32:21,but it's got Andy Warhol's signature.
00:32:21,00:32:24,So why do you think he might be lying?
00:32:24,00:32:26,No one has properly confirmed it.
00:32:26,00:32:27,"Yes, we saw that."
00:32:27,00:32:29,"And obviously, the lunar module is still there,"
00:32:29,00:32:30,so we don't know if there's a tiny--
00:32:30,00:32:33,"Was it Andy Warhol's signature, just the cock and balls?"
00:32:33,00:32:36,"Well, it looks a lot like a cock and balls, yes."
00:32:36,00:32:38,But there's also a sketch of Mickey Mouse on that tile.
00:32:38,00:32:40,Does a Mickey Mouse look like a cock and balls?
00:32:40,00:32:42,I think.
00:32:42,00:32:44,"Flip Andy Warhol's signature upside down,"
00:32:44,00:32:45,and you've got Mickey.
00:32:45,00:32:47,"I think that says more about you, James, than it does."
00:32:47,00:32:51,"It says a lot about my childhood, doesn't it?"
00:32:51,00:32:53,"Yeah, so there's no final confirmation"
00:32:53,00:32:55,that there is a tiny art gallery on the moon.
00:32:55,00:32:56,But wouldn't that be nice?
00:32:56,00:32:58,"Actually, speaking of cock and balls in space,"
00:32:58,00:33:02,"there was a lot of worry when astronauts first went up,"
00:33:02,00:33:04,"whether-- well, not a worry, but they"
00:33:04,00:33:07,"were interested whether you could have sex up there or not,"
00:33:07,00:33:10,"because people thought that if you have an erection,"
00:33:10,00:33:13,the gravity might be needed to get the blood down there.
00:33:13,00:33:16,"But luckily, there was a guy called Michael Malaine, who"
00:33:16,00:33:19,was interviewed by Men's Health Magazine in 2014.
00:33:19,00:33:21,And he said that sometimes he had a boner
00:33:21,00:33:23,that I could have drilled through kryptonite.
00:33:23,00:33:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:26,00:33:26,So that's--
00:33:26,00:33:27,"Oh, wow."
00:33:27,00:33:28,That's put that to bed.
00:33:28,00:33:30,What an image.
00:33:30,00:33:31,There's some kryptonite.
00:33:31,00:33:33,None of our drills are working.
00:33:33,00:33:39,Can we get that guy with his rock hard boner and drill him?
00:33:39,00:33:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:41,00:33:42,"Oh, my god."
00:33:42,00:33:43,Imagine that guy's day every day.
00:33:43,00:33:44,"How was work, honey?"
00:33:44,00:33:45,Yep.
00:33:45,00:33:49,Managed to break through the unbreakable rocks with my dick.
00:33:49,00:33:53,"It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:33:53,00:33:57,"OK, my fact this week is that deer penises are often"
00:33:57,00:34:01,"sold with the pelvis attached, so the buyer knows they're not"
00:34:01,00:34:03,being ripped off with a seal's penis.
00:34:03,00:34:08,"If I had a quid for every seal penis,"
00:34:08,00:34:12,"I would have sent back to the shop, outraged."
00:34:12,00:34:14,"Well, the problem was you broke the seal, didn't you?"
00:34:14,00:34:16,And--
00:34:16,00:34:18,I don't think it was me who broke the seal
00:34:18,00:34:21,if I'm receiving his penis through the post.
00:34:21,00:34:26,So this was an article on the online magazine Stuff.NZ.
00:34:26,00:34:29,And it was about New Zealand's Pizzle Market.
00:34:29,00:34:35,New Zealand sells deer penises mostly to China and to Hong Kong
00:34:35,00:34:37,because they're used in traditional Chinese medicine
00:34:37,00:34:40,as a sexual vigor enhancer.
00:34:40,00:34:43,And this was basically just telling us
00:34:43,00:34:45,how well they're doing in the last year or so.
00:34:45,00:34:50,They've sold $5.2 million worth of pizzle.
00:34:50,00:34:54,"That's 1,700 tons of deer pizzles."
00:34:54,00:34:56,So if you can imagine a large sort of metal
00:34:56,00:35:00,"mirror that might be outside of theatre in the Midlands,"
00:35:00,00:35:02,it's about 170 of those.
00:35:02,00:35:04,That's how much it costs.
00:35:04,00:35:06,"I think that since 1994, like, it's the total."
00:35:06,00:35:07,"Sorry, yeah, that's right, yeah."
00:35:07,00:35:08,But it's a lot.
00:35:08,00:35:09,It's a lot of pizzle.
00:35:09,00:35:11,I didn't know anything about pizzle before.
00:35:11,00:35:12,I didn't know that was a word.
00:35:12,00:35:15,"Yeah, well, I only knew it because I studied English."
00:35:15,00:35:17,"And there's a line in Shakespeare where someone says,"
00:35:17,00:35:18,"""You bull's pizzle."""
00:35:18,00:35:19,That's a great insult.
00:35:19,00:35:20,I only knew it because of Snoop Dogg
00:35:20,00:35:23,"going shizzle-dizzle, man, nizzle-pizzle."
00:35:23,00:35:25,"I think if Snoop Dogg asked you to snizzle his pizzle,"
00:35:25,00:35:28,"then you'd be like, ""I want to get out of that party."""
00:35:28,00:35:29,I regret that evening.
00:35:29,00:35:31,"Yeah, a lot closer than, yeah."
00:35:31,00:35:35,But cattle pizzle is sort of a dog treat.
00:35:35,00:35:36,I didn't know this.
00:35:36,00:35:38,I think that's the only reason I knew it.
00:35:38,00:35:40,But we've all got different origin stories for pizzle.
00:35:40,00:35:42,"Yeah, you get bull's pizzle for dogs."
00:35:42,00:35:46,"Right, but clearly they do, but it's very distressing."
00:35:46,00:35:47,I agree with Andy.
00:35:47,00:35:51,"I've seen those, but does it say on the packet, ""Genuine penis""?"
00:35:51,00:35:54,"No, I don't think it says."
00:35:54,00:35:56,"I think in the ingredients somewhere,"
00:35:56,00:35:58,it makes clear that it is the pizzle of a bull.
00:35:58,00:36:00,I don't know if it has some genuine penis
00:36:00,00:36:02,"down across the front, like a warning sign."
00:36:02,00:36:05,I think that should be said on things I'm buying.
00:36:05,00:36:06,"We'll all club together, Dan,"
00:36:06,00:36:07,and we'll get you a T-shirt that says it.
00:36:07,00:36:08,How about that?
00:36:08,00:36:11,Do you know...
00:36:11,00:36:18,Took a while for you to get there.
00:36:18,00:36:19,But the prep is really...
00:36:19,00:36:21,"It's upsetting, isn't it?"
00:36:21,00:36:22,If you're the deer.
00:36:22,00:36:24,If you're the deer or the well-op...
00:36:24,00:36:27,"So you take it, you clean it, you wash it,"
00:36:27,00:36:29,"you hang it, you stretch it,"
00:36:29,00:36:31,then you cook it for several days.
00:36:31,00:36:33,This is the worst daft punk something I've ever done.
00:36:33,00:36:41,"Stretch it, hang it, clean it, cut it."
00:36:41,00:36:43,It's really upsetting.
00:36:43,00:36:50,"It is, and actually, the farmers tend to not get paid for it."
00:36:50,00:36:54,"If you're a deer farmer, you don't get extra money for your pizzle."
00:36:54,00:36:56,It... The money goes...
00:36:56,00:36:58,For your deer's pizzles.
00:36:58,00:37:01,"The money goes to the people who kind of cut it up,"
00:37:01,00:37:02,"the butchers and stuff like that,"
00:37:02,00:37:05,and then they get it as an extra bit of money.
00:37:05,00:37:09,"And there was a guy who was in charge of Deer Industry New Zealand,"
00:37:09,00:37:12,and he said that it can't be justified
00:37:12,00:37:14,that you can pay them extra for it
00:37:14,00:37:17,until farmers have a way of producing animals
00:37:17,00:37:20,with attributes like larger tails or pizzles.
00:37:20,00:37:23,So until you can find the way of making a deer
00:37:23,00:37:25,"with an absolutely enormous penis,"
00:37:25,00:37:27,you're not going to get paid extra for it.
00:37:27,00:37:30,"OK, because the butchers have to do a lot of work, basically."
00:37:30,00:37:34,"Because there is a big difference in value with size, isn't there?"
00:37:34,00:37:37,So they're sold in different sizes.
00:37:37,00:37:41,"You've got the under 10-inch, lame, 10 to 12-inch..."
00:37:41,00:37:45,"10 to 12 inches, OK, 12 to 14."
00:37:45,00:37:47,And then over 14 inches is where it's really at
00:37:47,00:37:51,"if you want to have all your virility problems solved,"
00:37:51,00:37:52,according to Chinese medicine.
00:37:52,00:37:54,"And somewhere up to 20 inches long,"
00:37:54,00:37:57,which I think you're pretty much immortal once you've eaten that.
00:37:57,00:37:59,Some are 36.
00:37:59,00:38:00,-That's even longer than 20. -Really?
00:38:00,00:38:02,"Well, that's after they've been stretched, yeah, yeah."
00:38:02,00:38:06,"-After the stretching. -That's after the stretching process is over, yeah."
00:38:06,00:38:07,And we should say the reason...
00:38:07,00:38:11,"Oh, maybe you did say that the reason the deer is so..."
00:38:11,00:38:13,"Well, the reason it's upsetting when you get a seal instead of a deer"
00:38:13,00:38:15,"is because the deer is so valuable, right?"
00:38:15,00:38:18,A seal penis is nothing compared to a deer.
00:38:18,00:38:21,"And in fact, there are often others being substituted for deer penises."
00:38:21,00:38:24,"Like, I think there's a big problem with sheep's penis and testicles,"
00:38:24,00:38:27,"-pizzles. So, a pizzle is sort of the two together. -Mm."
00:38:27,00:38:33,"Sheep's pizzle being sold counterfeiting, pretending to be deer pizzle."
00:38:33,00:38:35,"And it's because sheep have much bigger testicles,"
00:38:35,00:38:38,"-and so they get a lot more bang for their bark. -Yeah, you can bulk it out, can't you?"
00:38:38,00:38:40,"-It's not a bark, guys. -Right."
00:38:40,00:38:43,"-Oh, very nice. -Oh!"
00:38:43,00:38:47,"I can't... In my head right now, I can't picture a seal's penis."
00:38:47,00:38:49,(LAUGHTER)
00:38:49,00:38:51,"No, no, you're right."
00:38:51,00:38:56,"So, like, I can picture a bull and a sheep, but a seal..."
00:38:56,00:38:58,"If we're talking, do they have testicles as well?"
00:38:58,00:39:00,-I guess they are inside. -I guess they are inside.
00:39:00,00:39:01,-The testicles. -They're inside.
00:39:01,00:39:03,"-I think so, yeah. -Ah."
00:39:03,00:39:06,"Weird thing that just happened, I just pictured seal's penis,"
00:39:06,00:39:08,"and that's the singer, and..."
00:39:08,00:39:10,(LAUGHTER)
00:39:10,00:39:12,"-He's good. -You're in public, Dan."
00:39:12,00:39:14,"Like, you're doing a show. You don't need to say everything"
00:39:14,00:39:16,"-that comes into your head. -Well, I couldn't see a seal's, but then I thought,"
00:39:16,00:39:19,"""Oh, seal, he must have one."" And..."
00:39:19,00:39:23,"-My God, he does. -I think they have, like, a genital slit,"
00:39:23,00:39:25,which then opens up and the penis comes out.
00:39:25,00:39:26,"-Seal's. -The singer, yeah."
00:39:26,00:39:28,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:28,00:39:29,(LAUGHTER)
00:39:29,00:39:32,Have you guys heard of Fuchsia Dunlop?
00:39:32,00:39:35,"-Uh, yeah. -She is an English writer and cook,"
00:39:35,00:39:37,and she was the first Westerner to train as a chef
00:39:37,00:39:40,at the Sichuan Institute in Chengdu.
00:39:40,00:39:45,And she has written one of the greatest articles I have ever read online
00:39:45,00:39:48,"about cooking, um, ""pizzles."""
00:39:48,00:39:52,She used some traditional Chinese recipes to do this.
00:39:52,00:39:54,She made it into kind of a stew.
00:39:54,00:39:57,"Uh, she said, ""The raw testicle penises in particular"
00:39:57,00:40:01,"""were a shocking sight, because they were too big to fit in the fridge."""
00:40:01,00:40:04,(LAUGHTER)
00:40:04,00:40:06,So she kept them outside on the side.
00:40:06,00:40:09,"""The silent presence, huge, furry and outrageous,"
00:40:09,00:40:13,"""cast a strange atmosphere over the apartment that night."""
00:40:13,00:40:15,(LAUGHTER)
00:40:15,00:40:18,And she goes on and goes on about how she kind of cooked these things.
00:40:18,00:40:20,"And she said that, at one stage, she says,"
00:40:20,00:40:25,"""The next step was the bleaching, at which the ""pizzles are abruptly stiffened."
00:40:25,00:40:28,"""One of them lunged out of the saucepan when we weren't looking."""
00:40:28,00:40:30,(LAUGHTER)
00:40:30,00:40:31,"""Lunged."""
00:40:31,00:40:33,(LAUGHTER)
00:40:33,00:40:35,"I could go on and on, but it is the greatest article."
00:40:35,00:40:37,I'll put it on my Twitter. I don't believe I'll be good.
00:40:37,00:40:39,She's amazing if you've done that. I've got her cookbook.
00:40:39,00:40:42,"She's the woman who brought Chinese cooking to the West, really."
00:40:42,00:40:43,"-Oh, really? -Yeah, yeah."
00:40:43,00:40:45,"-She's still alive. -Fabre recipes, yeah."
00:40:45,00:40:46,-Nice. -Have you...
00:40:46,00:40:48,"You guys may have found this in the course of your research,"
00:40:48,00:40:52,"but another useful pizzle, if you're not feeding it to a dog"
00:40:52,00:40:55,"or whatever it may be, or using it in traditional Chinese medicine,"
00:40:55,00:40:58,is that it makes a good walking stick.
00:40:58,00:41:02,"-For a very small person. -What? Yeah. What, for Yoda?"
00:41:02,00:41:05,For a three-foot walking stick?
00:41:05,00:41:08,-That's a reasonable height. -But that's after it's been stretched.
00:41:08,00:41:10,"It's after it's been stretched. Yeah, that's correct."
00:41:10,00:41:12,"We're all... OK, we're on the same page now."
00:41:12,00:41:14,"That's a decent size, I promise."
00:41:14,00:41:17,"And basically, you can get these on..."
00:41:17,00:41:20,I can't believe I'm having to defend a 36-inch walking stick.
00:41:20,00:41:22,"Anyway, you can get them on eBay."
00:41:22,00:41:23,"There are some on eBay, which are antique,"
00:41:23,00:41:26,"and there is also a website, fashionablecanes.com,"
00:41:26,00:41:31,which has a lengthy section of prose about...
00:41:31,00:41:35,The legendary bull penis cane is the most unique of all walking canes.
00:41:35,00:41:38,"And it's sort of... There's a rod down the middle,"
00:41:38,00:41:42,"and then it's stretched over this, but it's genuine pizzle being used."
00:41:42,00:41:44,"And it goes on and on and on about, you know,"
00:41:44,00:41:47,using one of these canes will shock anyone when you tell them what it is
00:41:47,00:41:49,and it's sure to create an interesting conversation.
00:41:49,00:41:52,"It lists lots of people who've used canes in the past,"
00:41:52,00:41:54,"Johnny Depp, Madonna, Brad Pitt."
00:41:54,00:41:57,"None of them had penis canes, though."
00:41:57,00:42:00,"And this website is amazing, it goes on and on."
00:42:00,00:42:04,"It says, ""Even if a cow penis cane is not your style,"
00:42:04,00:42:08,"""it can make the perfect gift for that hard-to-buy person on your list."
00:42:08,00:42:13,"""It makes the perfect over-the-hill or retirement gift."""
00:42:13,00:42:19,"If I retire and you guys give me a stretched bull's penis walking stick,"
00:42:19,00:42:22,I won't take it well.
00:42:22,00:42:25,"- Come on, you'll be absolutely delighted. - You'd love it."
00:42:25,00:42:29,It's not very useful on a cold day when you're going for a walk.
00:42:29,00:42:38,"This is a traditional cure for impotence, I suppose, right?"
00:42:38,00:42:42,"It's largely what you'll grind up, some bull's pizzle or some deer pizzle."
00:42:42,00:42:45,"You'll drink it, you'll go on for years."
00:42:45,00:42:49,- And I was just looking at some other... - The cryptonite won't know what hit it.
00:42:49,00:42:53,The planet of Krypton was split in two.
00:42:53,00:42:58,"So, if the pizzle didn't work,"
00:42:58,00:43:01,"quite an important part of the Protestant Reformation,"
00:43:01,00:43:05,"according to my reading, which was biased towards the word ""pizzle"" fine,"
00:43:05,00:43:08,was this other ritual that you would do to solve impotence.
00:43:08,00:43:12,"So this is around 15th century, 16th century."
00:43:12,00:43:17,It was to urinate through your wife's wedding ring and...
00:43:17,00:43:22,- From what distance? - I think she's wearing it at the time.
00:43:22,00:43:27,But this was cited as one of the reasons that Calvin wanted to do away
00:43:27,00:43:31,"with the exchange of wedding rings, because he was, you know,"
00:43:31,00:43:34,"Calvin's great Protestant leader, he was worried that this superstition"
00:43:34,00:43:36,was kind of taking over the wedding ring superstition.
00:43:36,00:43:39,Men were just sort of pissing through women's wedding rings all the time.
00:43:39,00:43:42,"And it said, ""If that didn't work and you still couldn't get it up,"
00:43:42,00:43:44,"""then you had to go and urinate through the keyhole of the church"
00:43:44,00:43:46,"""that you got married in."""
00:43:46,00:43:47,No!
00:43:47,00:43:50,- Wow. - Wow.
00:43:50,00:43:53,"That's what that TV show, ""Through the Keyhole,"" used to be about."
00:43:53,00:43:55,"""Who pissed in a house like this?"""
00:43:55,00:43:58,"What's that done, do you think?"
00:43:58,00:43:59,I believe it was done.
00:43:59,00:44:02,"Well, the wedding ring thing was done enough for Calvin to want to ban it,"
00:44:02,00:44:05,so I reckon the keyhole thing was done enough for priests to be pissed off
00:44:05,00:44:07,"- and those cleaners to be very confused. - Yeah, absolutely, yeah."
00:44:07,00:44:08,- Yeah. - Wow.
00:44:08,00:44:10,"Another thing for the cleaners in the churches is,"
00:44:10,00:44:12,"""Is this meant to be here this year?"""
00:44:12,00:44:16,Viagra.
00:44:16,00:44:21,Does anyone need any? Because I have a bunch on me.
00:44:21,00:44:27,"- No, Viagra was invented and patented by Pfizer. - Yeah."
00:44:27,00:44:32,"Pfizer, who have just stepped up to help try and save the world with the vaccine."
00:44:32,00:44:35,- Yeah. - I've been injected with Pfizer myself.
00:44:35,00:44:37,"You sound so surprised. It's not like they were a little, like,"
00:44:37,00:44:38,blackberry-selling startup.
00:44:38,00:44:43,They were just one of the world's biggest medication manufacturers for the last 40 years.
00:44:43,00:44:46,It was never that you think you were going to get a COVID vaccine
00:44:46,00:44:49,- and you accidentally get a Viagra vaccine. - Imagine that.
00:44:49,00:44:51,We're all walking out with our arm in the air.
00:44:51,00:44:54,Like some Nazi rally.
00:44:54,00:44:59,"Sorry, there's been a mix-up with our famous vaccine."
00:44:59,00:45:02,"There's a thing called low-intensity shockwave therapy,"
00:45:02,00:45:07,which this is a proven thing that helps you if you have impotence problems.
00:45:07,00:45:11,"The physician will wave a wand over your penis,"
00:45:11,00:45:15,"and the wand makes these tiny shockwaves, little kind of..."
00:45:15,00:45:18,"What it sounds like is little clicks, like..."
00:45:18,00:45:23,"- And what that will do, apparently... - Get it off!"
00:45:23,00:45:28,- I don't... - What's that flip-up thing? - Exactly!
00:45:28,00:45:33,"Apparently, it sounds a bit like a Newton's cradle, you know?"
00:45:33,00:45:35,"- There's, like, that tie. - Yeah."
00:45:35,00:45:40,"And it stimulates the blood vessels, and it helps you to be unimpetent."
00:45:40,00:45:42,- Free willy. - Wow.
00:45:42,00:45:51,"Okay, that is it! That is all of our facts."
