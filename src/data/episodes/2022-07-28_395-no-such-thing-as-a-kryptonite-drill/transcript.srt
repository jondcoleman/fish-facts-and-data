1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,620
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,620
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish,"

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,620
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

5
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,200
 from Nottingham!

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,200
 (audience cheering)

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,200
 (audience cheering)

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,640
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,000
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,600
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,960
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,960
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,320
 And in a particular order, here we go.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,520
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,200
 - My fact this week is that in 2015,

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,400
 paramedics in Australia stopped asking patients

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,720
 to name the Prime Minister as a test of mental capacity.

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,640
 (audience laughing)

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,840
 'Cause the answer changes so often,

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,380
 it's no longer considered a reliable indicator.

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,380
 (audience laughing)

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,220
 - That's amazing.

23
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,080
 - It's absolutely, and it's true, isn't it?

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,360
 Australia is constantly trading its PM.

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,640
 In fact, there's a Twitter account which is called @WhoIsPM,

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,920
 where it gives basically half-hourly updates

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,520
 going, "It's still Scott Morrison."

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,880
 - So what you're saying is if you're in some kind of problem,

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,260
 the paramedics come along, you have to go,

30
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,160
 "I'm just gonna need to go on Twitter really quick."

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,600
 - They did say, I think the reason,

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,120
 the particular paramedic who was interviewed,

33
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
 and the article I read this in,

34
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,360
 the reason that he said he stopped doing it

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,320
 was because he'd actually had a patient

36
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,400
 whom he'd asked, "Who's the Prime Minister?"

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,320
 And they just said, "I don't know,

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,000
 "I haven't watched the news today."

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
 So.

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,960
 - Very nice.

41
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,440
 - That's a strong answer, isn't it?

42
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,320
 - I didn't really know how crazy Australia,

43
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,760
 I don't know anything about Australian politics

44
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,600
 before this.

45
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,480
 - So just to clarify it,

46
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,360
 there's this big thing of ousting your predecessor.

47
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,360
 So in 2010, Julia Gillard ousted Kevin Rudd,

48
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,320
 and that was really exciting after only three years.

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,680
 But then in 2013, Julia Gillard was ousted, guess who, by?

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,760
 By Kevin Rudd.

51
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,600
 - Yeah.

52
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,680
 - Then in 2015, Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott,

53
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,120
 then Turnbull stayed on.

54
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,360
 And basically, there are so many PMs specifically

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,680
 in that short period.

56
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,800
 - Yeah, it was five PMs in five years

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,400
 if you count Rudd twice.

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
 - Which you could, 'cause many people say

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,040
 he's sort of got two different personalities.

60
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,360
 - Ooh, wow, wow, super.

61
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,080
 - What's amazing is none of us in this room

62
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,600
 really know anything about him, but we all oued anyway.

63
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,160
 - It could have been worse, it could be worse.

64
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,920
 If you're in Nepal, for instance,

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,960
 and you get caught in an accident,

66
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,600
 since they became a democracy in 1951,

67
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,080
 they've had 53 changes of government.

68
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,120
 - Right, that's a lot.

69
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,960
 - That's a lot.

70
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,800
 - Yeah, that stuff.

71
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,520
 Although if Australia kept up its won a year,

72
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,880
 which it hasn't actually since 2015,

73
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,760
 but you know, it would be beating Nepal.

74
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,480
 - Who is the current Prime Minister?

75
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,880
 - So that's Scott Morrison now.

76
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,840
 It was Malcolm Turnbull.

77
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,920
 So they've had six and seven years,

78
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,800
 which is quite good, five and five years.

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,120
 - So Scott Morrison, is he the one

80
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,400
 who shit himself in McDonald's?

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,240
 - Sorry?

82
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
 - What?

83
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,920
 - Not familiar with this?

84
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,400
 - I'm not sure.

85
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,520
 - I think that's what he's most famous for, isn't he?

86
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,040
 - I don't know if that's what he's most famous for

87
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,960
 in Australia, the country where he's Prime Minister.

88
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,440
 - He's Australian, I don't know.

89
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,800
 Every time, literally every time he goes on television,

90
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,000
 he says, "Oh, I'm gonna be on ABC tonight,"

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,840
 and someone replies, "Tell us about the time

92
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,880
 "you shit yourself in McDonald's."

93
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,000
 - He's the Australian Paula Radcliffe.

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Is that what we're saying?

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,040
 - Yeah.

96
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,240
 Well, he is running a lot for Prime-

97
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,920
 - Hey!

98
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,760
 - Come on, guys.

99
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
 - Top crowd tonight.

100
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,600
 - Wow.

101
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,360
 - Aussie politics, it's just a bit more earthy and rude,

102
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,200
 isn't it?

103
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,600
 Genuinely, genuinely it is.

104
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,520
 It's quite, the stuff they say in Parliament

105
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
 is also really rude.

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,000
 So I looked up unparliamentary language

107
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,520
 from the Australian Parliament.

108
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,880
 And there is a lot, but there is a lot,

109
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,200
 especially if you include all the regional assemblies

110
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,960
 and things like that, list of things.

111
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,800
 I mean, they call each other nitwit, knucklehead, muppet.

112
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,640
 - That's not that bad.

113
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,160
 - These are a bit mild, yeah, yeah.

114
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,960
 My question is to the village idiot, that was one.

115
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,720
 - And they all answered.

116
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,280
 - Well, there's more.

117
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,520
 In 1994, one member of the Victoria House

118
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,360
 said to another one,

119
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,120
 "What is the difference between you and a bucket of shit?"

120
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,720
 And the speaker rightly said, that's unparliamentary language,

121
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,960
 and he said, "I withdraw bucket."

122
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,800
 - Wow!

123
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,680
 - It's had a long history of it.

124
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,760
 Every Australian PM has an offensive nickname.

125
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,200
 The first Australian Prime Minister was called Toby Tosspot.

126
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,040
 - Really?

127
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,120
 - They named that pretty much straight away, yeah.

128
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,080
 He was Edmund Barton, and it was turn of the 20th century.

129
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,800
 And Tosspot then was a term for someone who drank too much.

130
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,280
 And Toby was just what people were called in.

131
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,200
 - Like you toss a pot back.

132
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,040
 - He could toss a pot back.

133
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,440
 - Toss a pot, 'cause a pot.

134
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,400
 - QI, when I first joined QI,

135
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,160
 and I'm an Aussie, I should say, technically.

136
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,480
 - I wonder what village is missing there, idiot.

137
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,400
 (audience laughs)

138
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,560
 - I am Aussie.

139
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,680
 My dad's Aussie, and my grandmother's Aussie,

140
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,480
 and I lived there for my whole high school years.

141
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,760
 And when I moved to England, I moved to Oxford,

142
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,320
 where I didn't go to university,

143
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,800
 but QI was set up there,

144
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,680
 and there's a pub called the Turf Tavern.

145
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,120
 And in the Turf Tavern on the wall,

146
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,040
 one of our Prime Ministers has an award,

147
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,800
 a Guinness World Record, Bob Hawke,

148
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,320
 for downing the quickest yard of ale

149
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,520
 that anyone has ever done.

150
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,280
 It was in 1954, it was two and a half pints,

151
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,240
 he did in 11 seconds.

152
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,960
 It's since been beaten, but for the rest of his life,

153
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,640
 Bob Hawke, whenever he went to like cricket matches,

154
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,680
 people would give him a big pint to be like,

155
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,880
 oh, this is like a 70 year old man,

156
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,680
 and he'd fucking down it, and such a champ.

157
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,640
 - I think my favourite Australian Prime Minister,

158
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,480
 sorry, but was Tony Abbott,

159
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,600
 who was in opposition when I lived there,

160
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,080
 and he's an entertaining man.

161
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,600
 So he's very right wing Tony Abbott.

162
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,520
 He's done some wacky shit, so every Australian knows this,

163
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,400
 but it is worth watching if you haven't seen it.

164
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,280
 He went to visit an onion farm in Tasmania,

165
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,240
 or an onion seller, a big onion selling company,

166
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,800
 and the cameras were on,

167
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,680
 and he was like, God, I won't do the accent.

168
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,520
 God, your produce is so great,

169
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,800
 grabbed an onion, skin on, and just bit straight into it.

170
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,360
 (audience laughing)

171
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,440
 Just chowed right down, was asked afterwards

172
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,280
 what he was doing.

173
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,240
 He said, people eat raw onion all the time.

174
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,720
 It's fine, salads, whatever.

175
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,360
 The skin wasn't on, the skin was on.

176
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,040
 It's very clearly on.

177
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,880
 - Wow.

178
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,080
 - And then he did it again.

179
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,040
 A couple of months later,

180
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,720
 someone sent him a promotional pack of onions.

181
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,120
 He bit down on one again,

182
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,160
 then footage was on Earth of him eating a raw spring onion.

183
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,400
 The man's got a problem.

184
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,280
 - All spring onions are eaten raw in salads, aren't they?

185
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,360
 - Just on its own, from the floppy end.

186
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,200
 I mean, I think that's weird.

187
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,040
 - I remember that.

188
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,880
 - That is weird.

189
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,800
 (audience laughing)

190
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,240
 - I remember reading once that if you hold your nose

191
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,560
 and you bite an onion,

192
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,640
 then you won't be able to, it'll taste like an apple.

193
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,600
 And I tried that and it is not true.

194
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,160
 (audience laughing)

195
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,240
 - Maybe that's what he was testing out.

196
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,600
 - The first woman to be elected in Australia

197
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,280
 was someone called Edith Cowan,

198
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,520
 and she was, she won a seat in West Perth in 1921.

199
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,120
 But she had to go home whenever she needed the toilet

200
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,040
 'cause there was no female toilets.

201
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,520
 - Oh, wow.

202
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,160
 - Or to McDonald's and shit herself,

203
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
 I suppose it's possible.

204
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,400
 (audience laughing)

205
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,560
 - Did she live nearby?

206
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,000
 - Yeah, she lived around the corner.

207
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 - But even so.

208
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,280
 I don't, I'm not so, I'm not so...

209
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,160
 (audience laughing)

210
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,880
 She lived nearby, fine.

211
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,720
 There was one really cool thing in 2013,

212
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,960
 that was an election in Australia,

213
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,640
 as there were most years around then apparently,

214
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,080
 or oustings anyway.

215
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,880
 The voting booths came with magnifying glasses.

216
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,720
 - Oh yeah.

217
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,640
 - Because there were 50 parties on the ballot paper.

218
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,480
 - Wow, wow.

219
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,320
 - There were so many parties

220
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,280
 that you had to be able to zoom in.

221
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,560
 So it's for, yeah.

222
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,400
 - Wow.

223
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,240
 - I know.

224
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,560
 - Was that the election where,

225
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,960
 I think it was the lead up to that election,

226
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,240
 where they postponed the Prime Ministerial Debate,

227
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,880
 so much like us in Australia,

228
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,160
 they have the incumbent or the two candidates

229
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,760
 who are going to be Prime Minister before an election,

230
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,880
 go up in debates, various television debates.

231
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,960
 And the last one, it's a massive deal.

232
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,920
 And it's the first time ever,

233
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,880
 they moved it an hour forward, I think,

234
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,560
 because MasterChef was on.

235
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,400
 (audience laughing)

236
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,240
 - Wow.

237
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,080
 - Really, oh, it's big in Australia, yeah.

238
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,920
 - It's good.

239
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,560
 - Do you like it? - MasterChef is good, yeah.

240
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,400
 - That is pretty good.

241
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,720
 - And they are better than the British MasterChef people.

242
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,980
 - Supposedly, the, oh, wow.

243
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,320
 Supposedly, the worst Prime Minister that has ever been

244
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,720
 in Australia is Billy McMahon.

245
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,600
 He had a bald pointy head with big ears,

246
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,720
 and one opponent said he looked like a Volkswagen

247
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,040
 with both doors open.

248
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,880
 (audience laughing)

249
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,800
 He wasn't liked by even the people in his own cabinet.

250
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,200
 There was one guy who he worked with called Paul Hasluck,

251
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,960
 who referred to him as that treacherous bastard.

252
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,920
 (audience laughing)

253
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,520
 And the guy who was writing his potential autobiography

254
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,480
 said that he is a third-rate politician

255
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,880
 and that he could become PM.

256
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,320
 It is a damning indictment on the country.

257
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,200
 Heart Troops lies, cheaper tracks.

258
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,680
 What an unpleasant little turd.

259
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,880
 (audience laughing)

260
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,200
 - Another, actually, Prime Minister

261
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,560
 who's considered writing a book,

262
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,160
 but apparently didn't get round to it,

263
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,440
 is Malcolm Turnbull, who's the last Prime Minister but one.

264
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,040
 And he considered finishing off

265
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,960
 his mother's raunchy novel.

266
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,440
 (audience laughing)

267
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
 - Wow.

268
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,960
 - He actually, Malcolm Turnbull had kind of a sad childhood.

269
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,680
 He was very close to his dad,

270
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,320
 who tragically died in a plane crash when he was quite young,

271
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,840
 but his mother was this academic

272
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,240
 who'd run away with another man.

273
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,440
 And she went to America,

274
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,120
 and while in America, so she was called something Lansbury,

275
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,320
 and she was a cousin of Angela Lansbury.

276
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,160
 And while she was in America, Angela Lansbury said to her,

277
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,040
 "Mate, you gotta stop writing this dry,

278
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,000
 "boring academic stuff and start writing some fun shit."

279
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,480
 - Wait, so Angela, she's, is she murder she wrote?

280
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,680
 - Do you know Angela Lansbury, right?

281
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,600
 Yeah, murder she wrote.

282
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,360
 And anyway, yeah, she wrote a few raunchy novels,

283
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,240
 which sold quite well.

284
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,560
 And then she died halfway through writing a novel called

285
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,520
 Opium, exclamation mark.

286
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,360
 (audience laughing)

287
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,440
 - Sounds like a musical.

288
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,360
 - It does, it does.

289
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,600
 - Quite a sleepy musical.

290
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,520
 - Well, I think her son might still be working on it.

291
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,600
 So now he's out of office.

292
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,800
 Maybe we'll get Opium, finally.

293
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,520
 - Malcolm Turnbull's podcast,

294
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,280
 "My Mum Wrote a Porno," is gonna be...

295
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,200
 (audience laughing)

296
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,080
 Stone Cold Hit, I think.

297
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,640
 - On the test that you can get from people,

298
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,640
 from paramedics, or another one is like,

299
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,440
 if you've been in a crash and they wanna check

300
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,360
 if you've been drinking, right?

301
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,800
 There was a thing with Tiger Woods a few months ago.

302
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,720
 Do you remember he was in a car crash,

303
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,800
 and they wanted to check if he'd been drinking?

304
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,640
 And so they said to him,

305
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,480
 "Okay, Tiger, what you need to do

306
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,840
 "is you need to say the alphabet forwards, not backwards.

307
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,520
 "You need to say the alphabet forwards,

308
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,360
 "and you're not allowed to sing it.

309
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,560
 "So, Tiger, do you know what you have to do?"

310
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,840
 And he said, "Yes, I have to not sing

311
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,720
 "the national anthem backwards."

312
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,720
 (audience laughing)

313
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,600
 - Queen Gracious, save, oh, God.

314
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,640
 - You know he's American.

315
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,480
 - Yep, cool.

316
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,320
 (audience laughing)

317
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,480
 - All right, we need to move on.

318
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,600
 Okay, it is time for fact number two,

319
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,200
 and that is my fact.

320
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,100
 My fact this week is that three people

321
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,800
 were recently hospitalized

322
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,880
 after being hit by an iceberg at a Titanic Museum.

323
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,880
 (audience laughing)

324
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,920
 So this is the Titanic Museum attraction,

325
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,840
 which is in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee,

326
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,960
 and they have this giant ice wall

327
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,800
 inside of the attraction,

328
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,160
 and it's 15 foot by 28 foot,

329
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,920
 and it's sort of, it is actual real ice,

330
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,480
 so visitors can actually touch it,

331
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,600
 and it's grown using a sort of water filtration system,

332
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,160
 and the whole thing just cracked and smashed down,

333
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,960
 and it hurt people, and they were hospitalized,

334
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,560
 but I think-- - But they survived.

335
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,160
 - They survived. - Yeah, as in you're saying,

336
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,520
 the hearts will go on.

337
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,640
 (audience laughing)

338
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,880
 - But yeah, I think it's time we don't put any ice

339
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,440
 near things called Titanic.

340
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,360
 - Yeah.

341
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,680
 - It feels like, 'cause it happens a lot, doesn't it?

342
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,320
 It's not just-- - I don't know how,

343
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,760
 it's happened twice. - Oh, my God.

344
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,880
 It's happened more than twice,

345
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,960
 famously the first time it happened.

346
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,240
 We've all heard of that one.

347
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,960
 2008, Carnegie Science Center,

348
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,600
 there was a Titanic exhibit that was in Pittsburgh.

349
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,640
 They had to temporarily close due to flooding,

350
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,720
 so that stopped them.

351
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,960
 There was a Titanic musical, which was in Southampton,

352
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,240
 which had to be stopped after the replica Titanic

353
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,280
 hit the iceberg, and plastic fell off the wall.

354
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,240
 That was the actual iceberg. - Oh, my goodness.

355
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,800
 - Yeah, and everyone, all the audience,

356
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,280
 thought, "Wow, that's an amazing effect,"

357
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,560
 but then the crew ran out going,

358
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,520
 "Stop the show!" (audience laughing)

359
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,600
 I read, and like, I haven't actually confirmed this,

360
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,240
 but there was another Titanic musical incident

361
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,400
 where a burst pipe just exploded

362
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,560
 across the first three rows of the audience,

363
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,800
 and everyone left angrily, and one person went,

364
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,480
 "Wow, we truly experienced the sinking of the Titanic."

365
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,760
 (audience laughing)

366
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,040
 - Need to confirm that one. - Makes you think.

367
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,880
 - Wow. - Nice one.

368
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,080
 You can really empathize with those figures from history.

369
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,200
 Well, there was even in 1898,

370
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,280
 a Titan ship that hit an iceberg and sank,

371
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,720
 which was a fictional ship, but a novel was written.

372
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,040
 In 1898, by a guy called Morgan Robertson,

373
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,360
 it was called "Futility,"

374
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,800
 starring a ship called Titan,

375
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,360
 and it had been built in Britain.

376
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,440
 It was sailing to America.

377
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,960
 It was going too fast, hits an iceberg,

378
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,640
 not enough lifeboats, half the crew die.

379
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,360
 - Yeah, gosh. - In 1898.

380
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,280
 - Very depressing. - There are a few details

381
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,440
 that are slightly different.

382
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,280
 It also involves in the plot,

383
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,400
 the boat cuts another boat in half

384
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,440
 while plowing through to the iceberg,

385
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,800
 and yeah, it just cuts one in half.

386
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,960
 It's about this massive boat that's so huge

387
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,680
 it leaves other boats in its midst.

388
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,800
 It's sort of like a monster boat.

389
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,080
 And then when it crashes,

390
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,520
 the hero almost goes down with the ship,

391
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
 but thankfully he survives.

392
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,400
 I believe ends up on the iceberg

393
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,320
 and manages to rescue the young child

394
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,360
 of the woman he fancies from a polar bear

395
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,320
 who's trying to eat him.

396
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,400
 - Oh, okay. - So...

397
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,560
 - So some of it is also...

398
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,920
 Yeah, that's close, yeah, yeah.

399
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,560
 - Apparently the V&A Museum,

400
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,240
 they did a Titanic exhibit,

401
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,920
 and apparently this book, "Titan,"

402
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,840
 was on the Titanic as part of the reading library.

403
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,080
 - Apparently. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

404
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,840
 - Just quickly on Titanic.

405
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,280
 So it was called the RMS Titanic.

406
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,360
 Do you know what RMS stands for?

407
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,680
 - Royal Mail... No.

408
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,400
 - It's Royal Mail Steamer, okay?

409
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,240
 'Cause it was a postal ship as well.

410
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,040
 There were 3,000 bags of post on board,

411
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,280
 but the postal workers,

412
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,240
 when they found out that the ship was flooding,

413
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,880
 they tried moving 200 sacks of registered mail

414
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,360
 to the upper decks of the ship.

415
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,200
 - Oh, really?

416
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,720
 - They forced several stewards to help them,

417
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,120
 saying, "Look, this is the registered stuff.

418
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,320
 "This is important."

419
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,960
 They were told not to bother, but they kept going.

420
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,400
 - I always get confused about when a disaster's happening.

421
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
 If there's staff members work in a place,

422
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,680
 they're like dedicated to their job,

423
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,520
 to the point of like,

424
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,440
 "We've got to play the music till the ship goes down.

425
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,880
 "We've got to bring the mail up."

426
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,480
 Guys, if there's a fire here tonight,

427
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,400
 I'm fucking off straight away, right?

428
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,800
 I am not being like, "Get the audience out!"

429
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,640
 No.

430
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,720
 - Do you guys know about Clive Palmer's

431
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,080
 giant Titanic replica, right?

432
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,200
 Clive Palmer is an Australian billionaire.

433
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,560
 He's an Australian billionaire.

434
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,760
 He's an eccentric.

435
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,240
 He wants to make Titanic too,

436
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,200
 and he's been promising it for ages,

437
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,400
 and it will be a cruise ship by his company,

438
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,480
 the Blue Star Line,

439
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,200
 and it will take the same route as Titanic.

440
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,280
 I mean, I don't know why he thinks people would go on this,

441
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,320
 but then it's completely recreated inside,

442
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,920
 and he's been promising it for a long time,

443
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,000
 and sort of the project keeps having various issues.

444
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,960
 Anyway, it's been moved to Europe.

445
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,360
 The project was gonna be based in Britain,

446
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,480
 because of Brexit, I'm afraid.

447
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,880
 It's now based in France,

448
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
 and the, yeah, well,

449
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,400
 if you want Titanic too, don't leave the EU.

450
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,840
 - If only that was on the side of a bus.

451
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,360
 - Unfortunately, it was painted on the side

452
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,200
 of an enormous ship, which then sank.

453
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,720
 (audience laughing)

454
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,240
 But the project director in Europe

455
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,400
 is the director of this whole Titanic project,

456
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,520
 is his nephew, who's called Clive Mencink.

457
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,040
 - Wow, really?

458
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,280
 - Yeah, it's doomed.

459
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,120
 - Some other stuff on other weird things

460
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,320
 that have happened in museums.

461
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,640
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

462
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,600
 - This was in Denmark.

463
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,320
 I was reading about an artist called Jens Haening,

464
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,560
 and what they did was they commissioned him to do this work.

465
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,480
 They were gonna give him 534,000 kroner,

466
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,400
 and what he was gonna do,

467
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,880
 he was gonna put it in a huge sort of art installation,

468
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,360
 and it would be a picture of something.

469
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,760
 They didn't know what it was gonna be,

470
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,920
 and that was the average amount of money

471
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,720
 that a Danish person earns in a year.

472
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,160
 Anyway, so he went away,

473
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,840
 and then he came back with a complete empty canvas,

474
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,120
 and it was an artwork that he called Take the Money and Run.

475
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,560
 (audience laughing)

476
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,400
 - So good.

477
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,920
 - Did they take that in the good human spirit,

478
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,760
 which he hoped they would?

479
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,640
 - The guy who runs a museum said,

480
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,880
 "He stirred up my curatorial staff,

481
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,600
 "and he also stirred me up a bit,

482
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,360
 "but I also had a laugh 'cause it was really humoristic."

483
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,720
 But then he did say that he needs to pay the money back.

484
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,960
 (audience laughing)

485
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,000
 - I really like incidents of museums,

486
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,720
 you just, you know, making flubs and blunders

487
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,680
 and accidentally ruining exhibits and things like that.

488
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,560
 So the National History Museum,

489
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,440
 they released a list of their incidents in 2009.

490
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,600
 One of them, slightly shortly before that,

491
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,720
 was there were these things called conodonts,

492
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,160
 which are their extinct eel-like creatures, okay?

493
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,840
 They had 22 of them,

494
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,800
 and they were accidentally knocked over and then hoovered up.

495
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,440
 (audience laughing)

496
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,800
 Which I just, I like.

497
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,160
 - Did they retrieve them from the back?

498
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,240
 - No, I don't think so.

499
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,080
 - Why? - Oh, shit.

500
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,920
 - Well, I think they were ruined

501
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,000
 in the process of being hoovered up.

502
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,840
 I think that's not--

503
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,040
 - Oh, they're just a bit fluffy.

504
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,880
 - Yeah, exactly. - Sorry.

505
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,520
 - Just wipe that off. (laughing)

506
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,880
 - There was, there was an art gallery

507
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,200
 that had a exhibition,

508
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,840
 I can't remember, I can't remember what it was,

509
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,080
 but it was an exhibition that showed lots of like,

510
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,120
 remnants from a party,

511
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,240
 kind of cigarette butts and empty beer bottles

512
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,120
 and, you know, stuff strewn around,

513
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,400
 and the cleaner cleaned it all up in the morning.

514
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,720
 - Yeah, that happens a bunch, yeah.

515
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,840
 Like Damien Hirst had one where the garbage was carried.

516
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,720
 There was one where there was a garbage bag,

517
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,280
 and they took it away and they apologized,

518
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,120
 and he was like, "That's fine."

519
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,320
 He just gave another garbage bag.

520
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,680
 - Yeah, I'm sure I must have said it on here before,

521
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,000
 but the time I went to an art gallery in Barcelona,

522
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,240
 and there was someone collapsed in the corner,

523
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,480
 and I ran to the front and said,

524
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,320
 "Oh, does someone collapse in the corner of that room?"

525
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,520
 And they went, "No sir, that is part of the exhibit."

526
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
 (laughing)

527
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,440
 And it was just a doll,

528
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,560
 and I said, "Oh, that must happen all the time."

529
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,400
 And he went, "Nope."

530
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
 (laughing)

531
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,200
 - It happens so much,

532
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,880
 but it does happen with specific works of art,

533
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,920
 like either someone collapsed

534
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,360
 or just something that is designed to look like rubbish.

535
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,200
 So there was a, in 2011 there was an artwork

536
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,760
 which featured a bathtub

537
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,600
 with a sort of thick, scummy line around the inside,

538
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,800
 and that was scrubbed by an overzealous

539
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,080
 member of cleaning staff.

540
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,640
 - Did she not wonder why there was a bath

541
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,720
 in the middle of the gallery?

542
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,120
 - Exactly, I think that's a fair cop, actually.

543
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,280
 But there's an article called Joseph Buys,

544
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,440
 B-E-U-Y-S, Buys, who had not Buys.

545
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,120
 What a fun, oh, I mean, never stop saying that name.

546
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,280
 - It's all about the Buys.

547
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,960
 (laughing)

548
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,080
 - He had an artwork which was a grease stain,

549
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,720
 and that was unsurprisingly scrubbed.

550
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,000
 And it wasn't the first time it had happened to him.

551
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,360
 He also had a baby bathtub in 1973 on display,

552
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,640
 which was wrapped in gauze and bandages.

553
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,040
 So baby bathtub wrapped up.

554
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,280
 Anyway, two cleaners just took it to wash the dishes in,

555
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,400
 'cause they thought this cannot possibly be a work of art.

556
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,240
 - Oh, really?

557
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,080
 - Yeah.

558
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,640
 - I feel like all the stories involved cleaners

559
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,960
 fucking stuff up, and we need to maybe--

560
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,040
 - A lot of blame on the cleaners,

561
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,360
 a lot of blame on the cleaners, yeah.

562
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,560
 - Yeah, we need to have a conversation

563
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,160
 with the cleaners at museums saying,

564
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,280
 you see all the random fucking shit here?

565
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,800
 It's meant to be easier if you're at

566
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,480
 the National Portrait Gallery, isn't it?

567
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,120
 It's much, much easier to tell what's art

568
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,360
 and what isn't at the National Portrait Gallery.

569
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,200
 - That's true.

570
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,160
 - 'Cause it's a portrait.

571
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,000
 - Exactly.

572
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,280
 - You're not gonna see a picture of someone's face

573
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,480
 and go, I'm just gonna rub that off.

574
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,680
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

575
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,280
 - Just gonna get rid of Rembrandt's mole.

576
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,120
 Hang on.

577
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,640
 - Macron, the president of France,

578
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,920
 he did a report in 2018,

579
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,480
 and he found that 90 to 95% of Sub-Saharan Africa's

580
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,440
 cultural heritage was held in museums outside of Africa, okay?

581
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,960
 So pretty much all of it's been taken out of Africa.

582
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,400
 And so there's a guy called Mwazulu Diabanza,

583
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,320
 who is an artist, and he's decided

584
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,880
 he's just gonna go to museums and steal it back.

585
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,920
 - Cool.

586
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,840
 - And so he basically goes around.

587
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:32,040
 So he goes around all these museums in France,

588
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
 and he'll just kind of walk in and see,

589
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,840
 oh, there's an ivory spear there that was from Congo,

590
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,560
 and he'll just go in and walk out and walk straight out with it.

591
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,160
 Occasionally, he did want to steal a sculpture

592
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,080
 that was actually from Indonesia.

593
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,920
 - Okay, right.

594
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,040
 - There was a bit of a mistake,

595
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,920
 but obviously he's been arrested from time to time.

596
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,800
 But this lawyer said, I don't know of any thief

597
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,960
 who turns up to a museum and says, film me.

598
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,520
 And then, having been filmed stealing the article,

599
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,960
 puts it back.

600
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,360
 So he doesn't put it back afterwards.

601
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,760
 - Oh, well that doesn't work out.

602
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,600
 - I thought he was like a reverse Indiana Jones, you know?

603
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,240
 That doesn't belong in a museum.

604
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,360
 That's the line from the third film, it doesn't matter.

605
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,400
 - And then what is he chasing after a massive ball?

606
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,240
 - He, yeah, that's right.

607
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,840
 He actually, he puts his hat into a room

608
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,200
 just as there's a wall about to crush him.

609
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,120
 Yeah, it's very exciting.

610
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,000
 - Just on injuries in museums, which this is about,

611
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,640
 there's a man who's suing Melbourne Science Works,

612
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,160
 Science Museum in Melbourne,

613
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,240
 for an exhibit they have where they have

614
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,480
 a virtual sprinter, Kathy Freeman,

615
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,600
 Olympic medal-winning sprinter,

616
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,000
 and they encourage you to race against her

617
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 on a 10-meter track.

618
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,800
 And what they have done is they've put the 10-meter track

619
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,800
 immediately in front of a wall, a quite solid wall.

620
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,440
 (audience laughing)

621
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,720
 And he's suing them because he's broken two vertebrae,

622
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,920
 another bone and a rib,

623
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,080
 and lost the feeling in his arms and hand

624
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,120
 because he ran headlong into a wall.

625
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,600
 - Oh my God.

626
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,800
 There's a French museum that was gonna hold an exhibition

627
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,720
 about Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire.

628
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,240
 But they were told by the Chinese government

629
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,480
 that they could only have the stuff

630
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,520
 if they didn't mention the words empire, Mongol, Genghis,

631
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,360
 or Khan.

632
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,360
 (audience laughing)

633
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,280
 - All right, we need to move on to our next fact of the show,

634
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,000
 and that is fact number three, and that is Andy.

635
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,040
 - My fact is that there are nine hammocks on the moon.

636
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,760
 - Who's using them?

637
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,040
 - Also, like no trees.

638
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,880
 - Yes, what a good point.

639
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,720
 There are nine tragically unopened hammocks on the moon.

640
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,800
 This is from a book called "An Answer for Everything."

641
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,360
 One of the pages is about everything there is on the moon.

642
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,800
 One of the things is, loads and loads of hammocks

643
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,800
 because Apollo 11, the first man landing on the moon,

644
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,160
 they slept really badly, they slept appallingly,

645
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,320
 and they just got a terrible night's sleep

646
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,160
 when they were there.

647
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
 - Well, it was sort of, so yeah, they were in the lander

648
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,280
 and they didn't really think of that,

649
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,040
 and it's so crowded, so Buzz Aldrin, I think,

650
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,240
 was basically laying on the floor as if he was just,

651
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,440
 you know, like you would if you were drunk

652
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,600
 and you got home and couldn't find the bed.

653
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,040
 That was him, and they thought we need to sort that.

654
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,040
 - Yeah, absolutely, so they, when Apollo 12 to 17

655
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,420
 flew with more man missions to the moon,

656
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,160
 they had these specially designed lunar hammocks

657
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,680
 that would go in the lander, and when you come back,

658
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,200
 you can't bring all your stuff with you,

659
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,320
 so they just left the hammocks behind.

660
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,600
 - And so, yeah, and it's amazing to think about it

661
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,960
 because they would land on the moon,

662
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,560
 and then they would set their hammocks up

663
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,780
 in a sort of X shape, so one lower and one above,

664
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,640
 and that's, they would just lay in it and just--

665
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,120
 - And this is not on the moon, we should say,

666
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,960
 this is inside the lander, right?

667
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,280
 - Inside the lander on the moon, though.

668
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,000
 That is how they slept, like they were on

669
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,520
 some sort of desert island, but the problem was,

670
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,400
 and the problem for a lot of these missions was

671
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,400
 the adrenaline is so great, you're on the fucking moon,

672
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,840
 you're not going to sleep, right?

673
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,680
 - Well, so--

674
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,960
 - And when Armstrong and Aldrin landed,

675
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,320
 they were scheduled to have a nap.

676
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,160
 - Yeah.

677
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,560
 - And the mission control said, right, you're on the moon,

678
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,720
 off to bed you go, and they said, absolutely not.

679
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,640
 We would like to go on to the moon now, please.

680
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,160
 - You know how, like, at nighttime, the moon comes out?

681
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,760
 If you're on the moon, does it always kind of

682
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,200
 feel like nighttime, or--

683
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,040
 - Good question.

684
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,880
 - Do you think you'd just be really sleepy

685
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,720
 the whole time?

686
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,320
 - I think I would, yeah, just naturally.

687
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,720
 - Apollo 14, unfortunately, where they landed

688
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,080
 with Apollo 14 was on a seven degree slant,

689
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,840
 so the lander was just slightly tipping,

690
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,960
 which freaked the shit out of the astronauts inside,

691
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,240
 so they couldn't get to sleep,

692
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,840
 because any time they heard a noise,

693
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,680
 they thought we're about to tip over,

694
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,760
 and you can read the actual transcripts

695
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,240
 of what they were chatting about, so one transcript goes,

696
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,880
 and this is while they were trying to sleep, I think,

697
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,720
 they go, Ed, did you hear that?

698
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,440
 He goes, hell yes, I heard that.

699
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,400
 What the hell was that?

700
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,040
 I don't know.

701
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,560
 Ed, what?

702
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,200
 Why the hell are we whispering?

703
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,640
 (audience laughing)

704
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,760
 But they couldn't go to sleep, they were so worried about,

705
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,400
 so that didn't happen, and then slowly Apollo 15,

706
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,880
 and 16, it got better and better.

707
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,240
 - I think mainly they had to make it better

708
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,520
 for Apollo 15, because that was the first time

709
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,200
 they'd stayed on the moon any length of time

710
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,480
 that required sleep, they were there for three nights,

711
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,280
 and they had to do proper stuff on the moon,

712
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,200
 like collect loads of samples, and drive,

713
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,040
 you can't drive when you're sleep deprived.

714
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,000
 It was the first time they had a car on the moon,

715
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,880
 and so they got proper hammocks,

716
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,720
 and I think they solved it

717
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,080
 by basically letting them take their space suits off, right?

718
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,680
 It was the first time that they'd allowed them

719
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,400
 to go back into the lunar lander and actually strip down

720
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,200
 so that you can adopt a comfortable position.

721
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,040
 - And I suppose the reason that the hammocks are on the moon

722
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,960
 is because you need to get rid of all your stuff

723
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,120
 when you're gonna take off again,

724
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,720
 'cause it needs to be as light as possible, right?

725
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,560
 - Exactly, yeah.

726
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,240
 - So I was speaking to this morning

727
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,720
 to someone called Beth O'Leary,

728
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,480
 who pretty much invented something called space archeology,

729
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,160
 she's a scientist, and she said that basically

730
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,000
 when Apollo 11 came down at least,

731
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,280
 for about eight minutes, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong

732
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
 stood on the corner of their lunar module

733
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,760
 and just threw anything out that they didn't need.

734
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,520
 They just threw it all out, we don't need this,

735
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,200
 we don't need that, we don't need the other.

736
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,720
 - That's a steering wheel, Buzz, I'll get it.

737
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,880
 I'm sorry, I think I heard Miss Ellis.

738
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,720
 - In archeology, apparently that is called a toss zone.

739
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,880
 - It's 'cause they fill the thing with rocks, right?

740
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,960
 - Yes, yes. - So weird going,

741
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,000
 dumping all the useful stuff and just filling it up

742
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,160
 with rocks for the way back, but...

743
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,360
 - They did leave some things,

744
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,960
 which now NASA would like to look at,

745
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,320
 but NASA would only like to look at them

746
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,080
 because they left them there, if you see what I mean.

747
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,200
 So bags of poo, basically. - Yes.

748
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,360
 - Bags of poo, urine, and vomit.

749
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,400
 There are 96 bags of all of this stuff

750
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,080
 on the surface of the moon still today,

751
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,640
 and NASA is fascinated to know what's happened

752
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,760
 biologically with them and what has lasted

753
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,400
 and what hasn't and what they could tell from it.

754
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,320
 And so if they go back to the moon,

755
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,680
 if there's another crewed mission to the moon coming up soon,

756
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,280
 it is possible that one of their jobs

757
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,880
 will be finding bags of poo,

758
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,960
 just doing a pooper scoop on the moon.

759
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,680
 - The truth is that it's not just that,

760
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,920
 it's everything that they left there.

761
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,520
 They want it to be like kept as it is, right?

762
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,240
 Because let's say Elon Musk goes up there

763
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,320
 for a party or something.

764
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,440
 What they don't want is him kind of knocking over

765
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,800
 all the flags and all the poo and all the hammocks and stuff.

766
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,720
 They want it all to be as it is.

767
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,640
 And so this year, actually the 31st of December last year,

768
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,960
 the US enacted the One Small Step

769
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,600
 to Protect Human Heritage and Space Act,

770
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,160
 which made it illegal to touch anything on the moon

771
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,840
 that the humans have left there.

772
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,280
 And it was really, really controversial

773
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,640
 because by law, no one owns the moon,

774
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,000
 no one owns any of the land on there,

775
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,920
 but America owns the objects that are on the land.

776
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,400
 And so it was really dodgy.

777
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,160
 The Soviets, sorry, the Russians really didn't want.

778
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,880
 (LAUGHTER)

779
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,400
 I think you've made your allegiances very clear there, James.

780
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
 (LAUGHTER)

781
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,520
 But they didn't really want the Americans to have this kind of law

782
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,760
 saying no one can touch this area because, well, it doesn't belong to you.

783
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,280
 Who are you to say who touched it and who doesn't touch it?

784
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,480
 And even more than that,

785
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,640
 if you look at the footprints of Neil Armstrong, for instance,

786
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,240
 theoretically, America owns the footprints,

787
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,640
 but they don't own any of the dust which creates the footprint.

788
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,120
 They're in the space directly above that dust.

789
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,720
 Yeah, they own the concept of the footprint, but not what makes it.

790
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
 Yeah.

791
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,280
 Wow, the cleaners are going to have an absolute nightmare

792
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,320
 when they turn up to the moon.

793
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,000
 Which bit of this is the party and which bit is debris preserved?

794
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,360
 (LAUGHTER)

795
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,240
 It's amazing that I hadn't thought of that, that in theory,

796
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,120
 Neil Armstrong's one small step for man,

797
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,400
 that one small step is still there, right?

798
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
 Possibly, yeah.

799
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
 Possibly because it was right at the bottom of the ladder,

800
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,760
 so Buzz might have landed and just smudged it out immediately, pissed off.

801
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,880
 Very likely, Buzz was here, right next to it.

802
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,200
 But like, the last thing that was left by an astronaut on the moon

803
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,080
 wasn't a physical object, but it was the last astronaut who was there

804
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,400
 who wrote, like you would in The Sand at a Beach,

805
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,480
 wrote the letters TDC, and that was the initials of his daughter,

806
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,480
 and that was Eugene Cernan, the last person to stand on the moon.

807
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,960
 And in theory, unless that bit of the moon is hit by, you know,

808
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,680
 space rocks and so on,

809
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,360
 that's going to be there for at least, you know, 50,000 years.

810
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,440
 Well, because there's not the same kind of atmosphere on the moon

811
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,680
 to mess it up.

812
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,040
 So in theory, Neil's footprint, if Buzz managed to sort of, like,

813
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,240
 do a wide berth with his landing, is still there, which is amazing.

814
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,400
 There is 100 metric tons of human material on the moon, man-made,

815
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,600
 which, if you can imagine there being a massive mirror in front of a theatre

816
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,000
 somewhere in the, you know, Midlands of England,

817
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,640
 it would be approximately 10 times the weight of that thing.

818
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,200
 That's going to mean a lot to all the listeners at home.

819
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,720
 It's also going to be confusing when James boosts that laugh in the edit.

820
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,240
 Here's one thing you can get if you go to the moon.

821
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,920
 The secret to David Copperfield's magic tricks.

822
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,720
 No! Yes, they are on the moon now.

823
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,720
 There was this private mission, there was a crash on the moon in 2019,

824
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,000
 which I can't believe we didn't, more wasn't made of it,

825
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,440
 there was a private spacecraft called Beresheet, and it had a disk on it.

826
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,640
 It had a sort of human library, which had Wikipedia, had thousands of books,

827
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,440
 and one of the other things on it was the technical illustrations and diagrams

828
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,200
 for David Copperfield's magic tricks.

829
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,440
 It's not certain that it survived, but it was in a really well,

830
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,640
 it wasn't just a DVD, it was a 25-layer sandwich of metal and resin,

831
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,240
 it was really well protected, and so it is possible it is surviving there.

832
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,520
 And Copperfield said he was so inspired by the idea of the mission

833
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,000
 that he wanted to give away secrets.

834
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,400
 I mean, when aliens get there and find that,

835
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,320
 they're not going to have the saw or the box to put the woman in.

836
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,280
 Or even the woman to put in the box.

837
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,240
 Another thing on the moon, a bunch of flags, as we know,

838
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,160
 very controversial at the time, whether to erect an American flag on the moon.

839
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,400
 So when Apollo 11 first went there, there was this big debate in the US,

840
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,000
 because it was that post-colonial era when everyone was saying,

841
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,440
 "That was really bad," where we stamped our flags in countries that weren't ours

842
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,840
 and claimed that they were, "Let's not do that again."

843
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,920
 And so they said, "Okay, we probably shouldn't put an American flag there,

844
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,240
 'cause it's like we're claiming it."

845
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,400
 And then there was a suggestion, which they seriously considered and almost did,

846
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,960
 to instead bring up a miniature flag for every country on Earth,

847
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,600
 for them to put into the soil at once.

848
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,720
 A little village.

849
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,000
 A little village.

850
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,800
 It's so sad they didn't have 160 tiny flags.

851
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,160
 I think it was a relief, 'cause it sounded like a real arseake

852
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,080
 hammering the one flag in.

853
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,800
 Right, really.

854
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,840
 So what do you do when, for instance, South Sudan?

855
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,400
 The South Sudan problem.

856
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,560
 You've got to go back.

857
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,680
 Every time there's a new country, you have to go back.

858
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,760
 Please don't divide into two countries.

859
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,800
 It's going to be so expensive for NASA.

860
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,560
 There already is.

861
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,280
 Not a model village, but a model something on the moon.

862
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:58,800
 There's a model.

863
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,280
 It's a miniature art gallery, which is very exciting.

864
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:02,880
 Oh, yeah.

865
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,720
 It's called the Moon Museum, and an artist called Forrest Myers

866
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,760
 commissioned artworks from six different artists

867
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,120
 to draw tiny, tiny drawings.

868
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,880
 And the engineer, at NASA, he gave it to,

869
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,520
 says that he stuck it onto the leg of the lunar module.

870
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,480
 So it's there.

871
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,640
 There's no confirmation it's there,

872
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,360
 but it's got Andy Warhol's signature.

873
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,240
 So why do you think he might be lying?

874
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,280
 No one has properly confirmed it.

875
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,000
 Yes, we saw that.

876
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,320
 And obviously, the lunar module is still there,

877
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,680
 so we don't know if there's a tiny--

878
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,080
 Was it Andy Warhol's signature, just the cock and balls?

879
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,000
 Well, it looks a lot like a cock and balls, yes.

880
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,960
 But there's also a sketch of Mickey Mouse on that tile.

881
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,800
 Does a Mickey Mouse look like a cock and balls?

882
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,080
 I think.

883
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,040
 Flip Andy Warhol's signature upside down,

884
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,440
 and you've got Mickey.

885
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,960
 I think that says more about you, James, than it does.

886
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,800
 It says a lot about my childhood, doesn't it?

887
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,440
 Yeah, so there's no final confirmation

888
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
 that there is a tiny art gallery on the moon.

889
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,480
 But wouldn't that be nice?

890
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,960
 Actually, speaking of cock and balls in space,

891
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,960
 there was a lot of worry when astronauts first went up,

892
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,680
 whether-- well, not a worry, but they

893
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,560
 were interested whether you could have sex up there or not,

894
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,560
 because people thought that if you have an erection,

895
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,800
 the gravity might be needed to get the blood down there.

896
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,880
 But luckily, there was a guy called Michael Malaine, who

897
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,920
 was interviewed by Men's Health Magazine in 2014.

898
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,840
 And he said that sometimes he had a boner

899
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
 that I could have drilled through kryptonite.

900
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,320
 [LAUGHTER]

901
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,920
 So that's--

902
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,600
 Oh, wow.

903
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,640
 That's put that to bed.

904
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,920
 What an image.

905
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,960
 There's some kryptonite.

906
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,600
 None of our drills are working.

907
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,320
 Can we get that guy with his rock hard boner and drill him?

908
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,000
 [LAUGHTER]

909
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,400
 Oh, my god.

910
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,880
 Imagine that guy's day every day.

911
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,760
 How was work, honey?

912
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,440
 Yep.

913
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,800
 Managed to break through the unbreakable rocks with my dick.

914
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,920
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

915
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,840
 OK, my fact this week is that deer penises are often

916
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,480
 sold with the pelvis attached, so the buyer knows they're not

917
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,760
 being ripped off with a seal's penis.

918
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,760
 If I had a quid for every seal penis,

919
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,040
 I would have sent back to the shop, outraged.

920
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,120
 Well, the problem was you broke the seal, didn't you?

921
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,120
 And--

922
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,280
 I don't think it was me who broke the seal

923
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,720
 if I'm receiving his penis through the post.

924
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,640
 So this was an article on the online magazine Stuff.NZ.

925
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,920
 And it was about New Zealand's Pizzle Market.

926
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:35,000
 New Zealand sells deer penises mostly to China and to Hong Kong

927
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,600
 because they're used in traditional Chinese medicine

928
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,320
 as a sexual vigor enhancer.

929
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,200
 And this was basically just telling us

930
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,960
 how well they're doing in the last year or so.

931
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,600
 They've sold $5.2 million worth of pizzle.

932
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,200
 That's 1,700 tons of deer pizzles.

933
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,840
 So if you can imagine a large sort of metal

934
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,720
 mirror that might be outside of theatre in the Midlands,

935
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,480
 it's about 170 of those.

936
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,440
 That's how much it costs.

937
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,440
 I think that since 1994, like, it's the total.

938
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,560
 Sorry, yeah, that's right, yeah.

939
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,240
 But it's a lot.

940
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,960
 It's a lot of pizzle.

941
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,360
 I didn't know anything about pizzle before.

942
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,840
 I didn't know that was a word.

943
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,440
 Yeah, well, I only knew it because I studied English.

944
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,480
 And there's a line in Shakespeare where someone says,

945
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,360
 "You bull's pizzle."

946
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,280
 That's a great insult.

947
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,600
 I only knew it because of Snoop Dogg

948
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,200
 going shizzle-dizzle, man, nizzle-pizzle.

949
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,880
 I think if Snoop Dogg asked you to snizzle his pizzle,

950
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,960
 then you'd be like, "I want to get out of that party."

951
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
 I regret that evening.

952
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,320
 Yeah, a lot closer than, yeah.

953
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,680
 But cattle pizzle is sort of a dog treat.

954
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,640
 I didn't know this.

955
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,080
 I think that's the only reason I knew it.

956
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,600
 But we've all got different origin stories for pizzle.

957
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,480
 Yeah, you get bull's pizzle for dogs.

958
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,520
 Right, but clearly they do, but it's very distressing.

959
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,360
 I agree with Andy.

960
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,080
 I've seen those, but does it say on the packet, "Genuine penis"?

961
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,600
 No, I don't think it says.

962
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,880
 I think in the ingredients somewhere,

963
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,920
 it makes clear that it is the pizzle of a bull.

964
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,800
 I don't know if it has some genuine penis

965
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,960
 down across the front, like a warning sign.

966
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,160
 I think that should be said on things I'm buying.

967
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,280
 We'll all club together, Dan,

968
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,640
 and we'll get you a T-shirt that says it.

969
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
 How about that?

970
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,640
 Do you know...

971
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:18,080
 Took a while for you to get there.

972
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,800
 But the prep is really...

973
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,320
 It's upsetting, isn't it?

974
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,160
 If you're the deer.

975
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,200
 If you're the deer or the well-op...

976
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,320
 So you take it, you clean it, you wash it,

977
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,440
 you hang it, you stretch it,

978
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,360
 then you cook it for several days.

979
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,400
 This is the worst daft punk something I've ever done.

980
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:41,200
 Stretch it, hang it, clean it, cut it.

981
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,920
 It's really upsetting.

982
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,720
 It is, and actually, the farmers tend to not get paid for it.

983
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,000
 If you're a deer farmer, you don't get extra money for your pizzle.

984
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,240
 It... The money goes...

985
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,240
 For your deer's pizzles.

986
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,640
 The money goes to the people who kind of cut it up,

987
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,840
 the butchers and stuff like that,

988
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,440
 and then they get it as an extra bit of money.

989
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,840
 And there was a guy who was in charge of Deer Industry New Zealand,

990
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,920
 and he said that it can't be justified

991
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,760
 that you can pay them extra for it

992
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,200
 until farmers have a way of producing animals

993
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,280
 with attributes like larger tails or pizzles.

994
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,240
 So until you can find the way of making a deer

995
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
 with an absolutely enormous penis,

996
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,240
 you're not going to get paid extra for it.

997
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,960
 OK, because the butchers have to do a lot of work, basically.

998
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,920
 Because there is a big difference in value with size, isn't there?

999
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,000
 So they're sold in different sizes.

1000
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,240
 You've got the under 10-inch, lame, 10 to 12-inch...

1001
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,240
 10 to 12 inches, OK, 12 to 14.

1002
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,520
 And then over 14 inches is where it's really at

1003
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,040
 if you want to have all your virility problems solved,

1004
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,720
 according to Chinese medicine.

1005
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,520
 And somewhere up to 20 inches long,

1006
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,560
 which I think you're pretty much immortal once you've eaten that.

1007
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,400
 Some are 36.

1008
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,600
 -That's even longer than 20. -Really?

1009
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
 Well, that's after they've been stretched, yeah, yeah.

1010
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,240
 -After the stretching. -That's after the stretching process is over, yeah.

1011
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,640
 And we should say the reason...

1012
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,440
 Oh, maybe you did say that the reason the deer is so...

1013
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,720
 Well, the reason it's upsetting when you get a seal instead of a deer

1014
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
 is because the deer is so valuable, right?

1015
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,440
 A seal penis is nothing compared to a deer.

1016
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,280
 And in fact, there are often others being substituted for deer penises.

1017
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,640
 Like, I think there's a big problem with sheep's penis and testicles,

1018
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,760
 -pizzles. So, a pizzle is sort of the two together. -Mm.

1019
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,080
 Sheep's pizzle being sold counterfeiting, pretending to be deer pizzle.

1020
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,520
 And it's because sheep have much bigger testicles,

1021
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,840
 -and so they get a lot more bang for their bark. -Yeah, you can bulk it out, can't you?

1022
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,360
 -It's not a bark, guys. -Right.

1023
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,560
 -Oh, very nice. -Oh!

1024
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,480
 I can't... In my head right now, I can't picture a seal's penis.

1025
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,960
 (LAUGHTER)

1026
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,520
 No, no, you're right.

1027
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,000
 So, like, I can picture a bull and a sheep, but a seal...

1028
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,360
 If we're talking, do they have testicles as well?

1029
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,040
 -I guess they are inside. -I guess they are inside.

1030
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,280
 -The testicles. -They're inside.

1031
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,400
 -I think so, yeah. -Ah.

1032
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,480
 Weird thing that just happened, I just pictured seal's penis,

1033
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,880
 and that's the singer, and...

1034
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
 (LAUGHTER)

1035
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,200
 -He's good. -You're in public, Dan.

1036
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,520
 Like, you're doing a show. You don't need to say everything

1037
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,480
 -that comes into your head. -Well, I couldn't see a seal's, but then I thought,

1038
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,360
 "Oh, seal, he must have one." And...

1039
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,000
 -My God, he does. -I think they have, like, a genital slit,

1040
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,240
 which then opens up and the penis comes out.

1041
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,880
 -Seal's. -The singer, yeah.

1042
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1043
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,600
 (LAUGHTER)

1044
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,520
 Have you guys heard of Fuchsia Dunlop?

1045
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,240
 -Uh, yeah. -She is an English writer and cook,

1046
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,680
 and she was the first Westerner to train as a chef

1047
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,720
 at the Sichuan Institute in Chengdu.

1048
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,800
 And she has written one of the greatest articles I have ever read online

1049
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,560
 about cooking, um, "pizzles."

1050
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,640
 She used some traditional Chinese recipes to do this.

1051
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,720
 She made it into kind of a stew.

1052
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,800
 Uh, she said, "The raw testicle penises in particular

1053
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,800
 "were a shocking sight, because they were too big to fit in the fridge."

1054
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,000
 (LAUGHTER)

1055
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,040
 So she kept them outside on the side.

1056
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,880
 "The silent presence, huge, furry and outrageous,

1057
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,120
 "cast a strange atmosphere over the apartment that night."

1058
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,440
 (LAUGHTER)

1059
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,480
 And she goes on and goes on about how she kind of cooked these things.

1060
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,600
 And she said that, at one stage, she says,

1061
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,400
 "The next step was the bleaching, at which the "pizzles are abruptly stiffened.

1062
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,960
 "One of them lunged out of the saucepan when we weren't looking."

1063
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,280
 (LAUGHTER)

1064
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,360
 "Lunged."

1065
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,000
 (LAUGHTER)

1066
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,640
 I could go on and on, but it is the greatest article.

1067
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,640
 I'll put it on my Twitter. I don't believe I'll be good.

1068
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,640
 She's amazing if you've done that. I've got her cookbook.

1069
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,400
 She's the woman who brought Chinese cooking to the West, really.

1070
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,520
 -Oh, really? -Yeah, yeah.

1071
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,240
 -She's still alive. -Fabre recipes, yeah.

1072
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,880
 -Nice. -Have you...

1073
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
 You guys may have found this in the course of your research,

1074
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,000
 but another useful pizzle, if you're not feeding it to a dog

1075
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,400
 or whatever it may be, or using it in traditional Chinese medicine,

1076
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,920
 is that it makes a good walking stick.

1077
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,040
 -For a very small person. -What? Yeah. What, for Yoda?

1078
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,400
 For a three-foot walking stick?

1079
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,000
 -That's a reasonable height. -But that's after it's been stretched.

1080
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,120
 It's after it's been stretched. Yeah, that's correct.

1081
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,680
 We're all... OK, we're on the same page now.

1082
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,480
 That's a decent size, I promise.

1083
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,240
 And basically, you can get these on...

1084
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,560
 I can't believe I'm having to defend a 36-inch walking stick.

1085
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,000
 Anyway, you can get them on eBay.

1086
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,920
 There are some on eBay, which are antique,

1087
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,920
 and there is also a website, fashionablecanes.com,

1088
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,200
 which has a lengthy section of prose about...

1089
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,600
 The legendary bull penis cane is the most unique of all walking canes.

1090
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,400
 And it's sort of... There's a rod down the middle,

1091
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,040
 and then it's stretched over this, but it's genuine pizzle being used.

1092
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,160
 And it goes on and on and on about, you know,

1093
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,400
 using one of these canes will shock anyone when you tell them what it is

1094
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,560
 and it's sure to create an interesting conversation.

1095
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,800
 It lists lots of people who've used canes in the past,

1096
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,600
 Johnny Depp, Madonna, Brad Pitt.

1097
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,000
 None of them had penis canes, though.

1098
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,880
 And this website is amazing, it goes on and on.

1099
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,120
 It says, "Even if a cow penis cane is not your style,

1100
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,880
 "it can make the perfect gift for that hard-to-buy person on your list.

1101
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,960
 "It makes the perfect over-the-hill or retirement gift."

1102
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:19,600
 If I retire and you guys give me a stretched bull's penis walking stick,

1103
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,640
 I won't take it well.

1104
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,880
 - Come on, you'll be absolutely delighted. - You'd love it.

1105
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,320
 It's not very useful on a cold day when you're going for a walk.

1106
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:38,520
 This is a traditional cure for impotence, I suppose, right?

1107
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,440
 It's largely what you'll grind up, some bull's pizzle or some deer pizzle.

1108
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,000
 You'll drink it, you'll go on for years.

1109
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,120
 - And I was just looking at some other... - The cryptonite won't know what hit it.

1110
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,920
 The planet of Krypton was split in two.

1111
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,000
 So, if the pizzle didn't work,

1112
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,560
 quite an important part of the Protestant Reformation,

1113
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,720
 according to my reading, which was biased towards the word "pizzle" fine,

1114
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,920
 was this other ritual that you would do to solve impotence.

1115
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,400
 So this is around 15th century, 16th century.

1116
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,160
 It was to urinate through your wife's wedding ring and...

1117
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:22,040
 - From what distance? - I think she's wearing it at the time.

1118
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,960
 But this was cited as one of the reasons that Calvin wanted to do away

1119
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,160
 with the exchange of wedding rings, because he was, you know,

1120
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,720
 Calvin's great Protestant leader, he was worried that this superstition

1121
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,880
 was kind of taking over the wedding ring superstition.

1122
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,440
 Men were just sort of pissing through women's wedding rings all the time.

1123
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,280
 And it said, "If that didn't work and you still couldn't get it up,

1124
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,920
 "then you had to go and urinate through the keyhole of the church

1125
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,480
 "that you got married in."

1126
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,480
 No!

1127
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,000
 - Wow. - Wow.

1128
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,360
 That's what that TV show, "Through the Keyhole," used to be about.

1129
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,600
 "Who pissed in a house like this?"

1130
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,400
 What's that done, do you think?

1131
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,520
 I believe it was done.

1132
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,440
 Well, the wedding ring thing was done enough for Calvin to want to ban it,

1133
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,320
 so I reckon the keyhole thing was done enough for priests to be pissed off

1134
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,960
 - and those cleaners to be very confused. - Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

1135
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,960
 - Yeah. - Wow.

1136
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,760
 Another thing for the cleaners in the churches is,

1137
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,640
 "Is this meant to be here this year?"

1138
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,400
 Viagra.

1139
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,520
 Does anyone need any? Because I have a bunch on me.

1140
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,520
 - No, Viagra was invented and patented by Pfizer. - Yeah.

1141
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,200
 Pfizer, who have just stepped up to help try and save the world with the vaccine.

1142
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,080
 - Yeah. - I've been injected with Pfizer myself.

1143
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,000
 You sound so surprised. It's not like they were a little, like,

1144
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,400
 blackberry-selling startup.

1145
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,600
 They were just one of the world's biggest medication manufacturers for the last 40 years.

1146
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,640
 It was never that you think you were going to get a COVID vaccine

1147
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,200
 - and you accidentally get a Viagra vaccine. - Imagine that.

1148
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,240
 We're all walking out with our arm in the air.

1149
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,200
 Like some Nazi rally.

1150
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,400
 Sorry, there's been a mix-up with our famous vaccine.

1151
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,880
 There's a thing called low-intensity shockwave therapy,

1152
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,400
 which this is a proven thing that helps you if you have impotence problems.

1153
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,400
 The physician will wave a wand over your penis,

1154
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,400
 and the wand makes these tiny shockwaves, little kind of...

1155
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,400
 What it sounds like is little clicks, like...

1156
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,400
 - And what that will do, apparently... - Get it off!

1157
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:28,400
 - I don't... - What's that flip-up thing? - Exactly!

1158
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,400
 Apparently, it sounds a bit like a Newton's cradle, you know?

1159
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,400
 - There's, like, that tie. - Yeah.

1160
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,400
 And it stimulates the blood vessels, and it helps you to be unimpetent.

1161
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,400
 - Free willy. - Wow.

1162
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:51,400
 Okay, that is it! That is all of our facts.

1163
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
