00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hi guys, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show, we wanted to say that we have a special guest on.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 It is none other than Major Tim Peake, soldier, pilot, astronaut, absolutely everything.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 He is the first British astronaut to go into space with the European Space Agency.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 He has done so many amazing things in his life, and part of the reason he's on is that he's got a new book out, it's his autobiography, it's called Limitless.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I've just finished it, it is so amazing the stuff he's done. He spent years flying helicopters, being a helicopter test pilot.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 He was in the army, he talks about going to Sandhurst, he's done all these incredible things.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 The number of adventures in the book, basically every single page has a new exciting weird thing he's done in it.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 He lived underwater for a while, that didn't even make it into the podcast.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 We didn't even mention the fact that he lived underwater. That's how many interesting things he has to say about his life so far.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 So we hope you liked the episode, and if you do, you should give his book a look.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 It is called Limitless, and it is out now from all book shops.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Even if the book shops aren't actually open, it can be ordered.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Okay, on with the podcast.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tyshinski, and special guest.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 It's Britain's first ever, and currently only ever space walking astronaut, Major Tim Peake.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Major Tim.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Well, my fact of the week is that when you do a space walk, you have to wear 16 layers of clothing and a nappy.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Was that definitely not a prank from the other astronauts, the nappy?

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I thought it might be, you know, when you get told the fancy dress party, and you turn up and everyone's wearing normal clothes.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 No, so the nappy is very, what we call a nappy, we call it a mag, a maximum absorbency garment,

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 so that we don't have to go around calling it a diaper or a nappy. But it's a nappy, it's an adult nappy.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 And that gives us an ease of mind to know that at any point during a space walk, if you need to go for a week, you can just let it go.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And is it like a standard nappy, just sort of a big wooly mess on your bum?

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I don't have children, I think, but I think that's what a nappy basically is, isn't it? Or is it more advanced?

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 No, it's a standard adult incontinence pad nappy. So you put it on and you've got two Velcro type straps on the left and on the right,

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 and you just, you know, tighten yourself up. And then we wear some long johns over the top of that.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 So that's layer number two, long johns and a kind of long sleeve top.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Layer number three is what's called an LCBG, a liquid cooling ventilation garment.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And that's pretty cool, actually. It's a it's a onesie that has got about almost a kilometres worth of piping, thin rubber piping going through it.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 And that's where the water flows through. And that's what regulates our temperature out on a spacewalk.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And then it's into the space suit. And that's where the other 14 layers of clothing.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Oh, I thought you were going to be able to list every single layer individually.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Well, I could, it might go on a bit. We might need more time for the podcast.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I was reading about the procurement procedure behind these garments, maximum absorption garments.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 So apparently they were made by a firm called Absorbancies, and they've gone bust, but NASA bought so many.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 They bought 3,200 of these in the late 90s, and they've still got some of them knocking around.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 But it seemed like they must be running short by now, you would say.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Well, you don't need many, do you? You don't need. I mean, I read that astronauts are only really given three.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 One for takeoff, one for re-entry. And if you're going on a spacewalk, there's your third nappy.

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Is that right? Training? Training? You need to practice?

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 We do. You absolutely right down at Houston, we have this big old swimming pool, the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory.

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And we wear them there as well, because we train exactly as we would do a spacewalk.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And so although we're only in the water for six hours, we still wear them so that we know what it feels like.

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And in fact, the advice was, because going through training, you never need to go.

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 But the advice from some flown astronauts was, Tim, at least once, just have a wee in your space.

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Because he said, you don't want to do anything for the first time on a spacewalk.

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 You want to have tried everything. So you know what it feels like, you know, it works.

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 At least do it once during training.

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And did you have to do it on the spacewalk?

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 I didn't. No, actually, I was very fortunate.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I perhaps should have probably to tell you that I was very dehydrated.

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Because we put that thing on, we start getting dressed at seven o'clock in the morning on spacewalk there.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 You're up at six thirty. And then you do your medical.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 You put a chest harness on, which has got monitors, your heart rate and breathing rate.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And then you're into a space suit quite soon.

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 So you end up spending somewhere about, you know, 10 to 12 hours in that space suit.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 But no, thankfully, I didn't need to use it.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Yeah, you've got to start drinking more.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 That is a long time.

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 OK, I read something that I really wanted to check because I don't think you mentioned this in the book,

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 but it might be sort of a previous astronaut procedure,

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 which is that sometimes you would have to spend the night before you do your spacewalk in a cupboard wearing your space suit.

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 So that you can get all the nitrogen out of your blood so you don't suffer.

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 You know, you don't get bubbles forming at this kind of thing for a danger.

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Yeah, actually, and you're partly right there because what we used to do is that they used to scamp out in the airlock.

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And so it wasn't a cupboard.

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 They would actually kind of take their sleeping bags in there and they would be breathing oxygen at a lower pressure in the airlock all night long.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And that was flushing the nitrogen out of their system.

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 But it was not comfortable and it was, you know, people were getting up very tired on spacewalk morning.

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And we've gradually we've become more and more comfortable with actually reducing that period of time.

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 But it's just the same as a diver trying to prevent themselves from getting the bends because inside the space suit,

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 we take the pressure down to about 4.3 PSI, so less than a third of the atmosphere.

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 It's slightly higher than Mount Everest, the equivalent pressure, which is pretty low actually.

77
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 And so you don't want to go into that low pressure environment with a whole stack of nitrogen in your bloodstream.

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Wow.

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 And then when you were out there, I was reading to be fair, quite old article of 1984 when the first woman did a spacewalk.

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 I think it was Lanna Savitskaya and she was a cosmonaut and she went out to do some welding.

81
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And the article about that said that, and I don't think I can believe this,

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 that they're so kind of uncomfortable and inelastic back then that you could lose up to three kilograms as in almost half a stone in the course of a spacewalk.

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Which I think that's impossible. I think dieters would be doing this left, right and centre of that level of weight loss was possible.

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Let's do the spacewalk diet.

85
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Exactly. Very expensive, but does work. Is it uncomfortable and heavy?

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 It is uncomfortable and it's hard work. You are really working hard because although it's a very, very low pressure,

87
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 compared to the vacuum outside, you feel like, you know, Michelin man in this blown up tire and bending of fingers, moving your arms is exhausting and just moving around in space is exhausting.

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 So you do come back physically, absolutely exhausted, but three kilograms, three kilograms sounds like an awful lot.

89
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And I tended to not believe the article the moment you said welding.

90
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Because, you know, we take risks on a spacewalk, but I don't think we'd go out there welding just in case.

91
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 The suits sound pretty amazing. I was reading that the gloves have a inbuilt heater system.

92
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 You know, like when you sit in a car and someone presses that button, you know, the driver presses the button in the back of your seat, something gets hot.

93
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 You're like, whoa, they have that on the spacesuits just above the fingernails on the gloves with a non off button on the wrist.

94
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 I believe so. Is that right to him? That's so cool.

95
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 That's absolutely right. Yeah. So the little it's a little tab that you pull on the top of your wrist.

96
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And when we're going into night, actually, we get mission control call up and they just say, guys, you know, you're 25 seconds away from from nighttime helmets, gloves and visors.

97
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 And so what they want there is helmet lights, switch them on visors, because we'll often have the gold visor down in the daytime for sun protection.

98
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 So gold visors up and then gloves switch them on so your fingers stay nice and warm.

99
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 And that is actually that's the only source of heat other than body heat to keep us warm on a spacewalk.

100
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And I guess that just goes to show how effective the suit is at protecting us against the cold from space because it's only our own body generated heat that keeps us warm other than the electrical fingertips.

101
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Wow. How cold? I mean, what's what's the temperature out there?

102
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 If we're in the shade or nighttime, it's just a few degrees. I mean, space is a few degrees above absolute zero and the things we're touching will be down at minus 100 Celsius.

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 But in the sunshine, metal panels can be as hot as plus 260 Celsius.

104
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 So even when you're working in the sun, you know, you might have one hand, you know, on one side of a solar panel in the sun and the other in the shade.

105
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And your space suit is having to cope with this massive, massive thermal, thermal differentiation between between the two.

106
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 So it's doing a remarkable job.

107
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 That's like Canada, I believe. I'm led to inform.

108
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 They send astronauts to Canada to live for a year, don't they, to prepare.

109
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 That would be good training, I'm sure.

110
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Does it feel, I mean, how odd does it feel when you step out of the airlock?

111
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 It's brilliant. I mean, it does feel odd because you just suddenly feel the exposure and, you know, you're aware that the danger is kind of palpable in that respect, like, OK, this is it.

112
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 I mean, the vacuum of space, just a suit and a thin visor, but you soon get comfortable and you get comfortable with the view as well.

113
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And, you know, you let go, you know, you're not going anywhere.

114
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 So as long as you're tethered onto the space station.

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 But sometimes the vertigo just catches you out unexpectedly.

116
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 It happened to me once.

117
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 I was coming back towards the airlock along this thin pole.

118
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 It's like a shortcut.

119
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And so I was not surrounded by structure at all.

120
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 And I was kind of like hanging onto this pole and I looked down and suddenly got this massive wave of vertigo seeing Western Australia down below my feet.

121
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 What a stupid time to look down.

122
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Oh, my God.

123
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 You know, one thing as you're looking down, if you are taken in by the absolute beauty of what you're seeing.

124
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 One thing you can't do in your space suit is go.

125
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Yes. Yeah, whistling.

126
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Whistling space.

127
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Well, it's no, I mean, it's really weird in that low pressure environment.

128
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Whistling is really, really hard.

129
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And your voice tends to kind of drop an octave, which for me is quite good because I've got a high voice anyway.

130
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 But it'd be great for David Beckham.

131
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 So yeah, it's one of those environments where, you know, you'd see in that low pressure just weird things happen.

132
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 So no whistling is really hard.

133
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Wow. I didn't know that about the voice.

134
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 That's what I want to try that.

135
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 That's I'm put off by the lack of whistling because my mum always said you can't be unhappy when you're whistling.

136
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 But I quite like the idea of the voice going down an octave, kind of sexy and sultry.

137
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Sexy astronauts.

138
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 That's the only version that we have.

139
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 It's funny when you say it's about sexy astronauts, one of the things that came up, why I came up with the fact is from gravity

140
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 and Sandra Bullock, you know, coming in from her spacewalk and taking it off and there she is.

141
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 All she's wearing is hot pants underneath her spacey.

142
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 So that's why I thought I've got a, it's been a myth busting here.

143
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 I can't believe that was your chief problem with the science of film gravity.

144
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Oh, everything else, everything else is perfectly accurate.

145
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 We fly around on fire extinguishers all the time.

146
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 You see George Clooney's ghost when you're up there.

147
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Everyone sees George Clooney's ghost.

148
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 When you're inside the ISS, the clothes that you're wearing, obviously quite different, more comfortable, hopefully.

149
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 But when you have to take them off, is it the case that I think I was listening to the NASA podcast and they were saying that dead skin is a real problem.

150
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 So when you're taking off your socks, particularly dead skin comes off a lot.

151
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 And do you have to take your socks off next to a sort of suction vent or something?

152
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Right.

153
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 It's gross.

154
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Yes.

155
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 There are some things about the human body you just don't want to really see.

156
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And we don't get to see on Earth how much we shed each day, really.

157
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 It's kind of hidden from us.

158
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 But up there, yeah, you take your socks off and in weightlessness, anything that's inside your socks will just come flying out.

159
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 And your feet, because you're not walking on them, all of the hard and dead skin that's accumulated all of our lives.

160
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 It's just after about a month or two, it's shedding off.

161
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 So big, big, horrible flakes of skin coming off your feet.

162
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 I mean, you have to do it next to the egg return grid because it's the cleanest way of doing it.

163
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Just take your socks off.

164
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Are they reusable for anything in the way that I know that urine is being turned back into water to drink?

165
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 That's a good point.

166
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 No, we haven't become that quite ingenious as to how to reuse dead skin.

167
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 One thing I really found interesting was what you described.

168
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 So you captured a cargo vehicle when you're up there, not what captured, you know, it was scheduled to come in.

169
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 It's not like you were just doing space piracy or whatever.

170
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 But the method by which you gauge how close it is, because you're using a robotic arm, aren't you, to hint to it at exactly the right moment.

171
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 And obviously it's rolling, you're rolling, there's lots of pitch and you're.

172
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 The method is so it's antiquated.

173
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 It is. It's unbelievable.

174
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And, you know, when I was first told, this is how you do it, I couldn't quite believe it.

175
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 I thought, hang on a second, you know, where's the laser rangefinder?

176
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Where's the image tracker?

177
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 You know, we are coming from a background flying all these sophisticated aircraft with these tracking systems and lock on systems and guidance systems.

178
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 No, you've got two old hand controllers and what your crewmates can do is print off some sheets of paper with pictures of how big the cargo vehicle looks at different ranges.

179
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 So when he sees it this big is loads, it's five meters, then four meters, then three meters.

180
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 I thought they're having a joke, but that is that is how we do it.

181
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And you just have to drive in this robotic arm from the cupola window looking at some old screens and just hoping it all goes to plan.

182
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 It's by far and above it's the highest pressure moment for any astronaut is capturing a cargo vehicle, more so than the space without a doubt.

183
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And if you miss it, is there a sort of second chance?

184
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Is that it? They're stuck in space now forever?

185
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 It depends how badly you screw up really.

186
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 If you if you just miss it, you can have a second chance if you haven't knocked it.

187
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 But if you knock it and it, you know, you can cause some damage or even cause it to go off tumbling into space, then that could be really bad.

188
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 So, yeah, the pressure is definitely on there.

189
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 So in the way that you train underwater for the spacewalk, do you also go to sort of amusement parks and play that claw game?

190
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 We have to catch a soft toy.

191
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I've never won at that claw game.

192
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 It's the most depressing thing in the world.

193
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Years of training, years of academy training wasted.

194
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

195
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 My fact this week is that visitors to the Sarawak Cave in Borneo don't report feeling claustrophobic, they report feeling agriphobic.

196
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Riddle me that.

197
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 What is going on?

198
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Is it huge?

199
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 It's big. It's the biggest cave chamber in the world.

200
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 So this is inside a cave system called the Good Luck Cave, and it would fit and it took me a long time to do this calculation because it's a while since I worked out volumes.

201
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 But it would fit roughly 10 Wembley stadiums inside it.

202
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I think based on Google Maps measuring of the Wembley Stadium, which is large, very tall, very wide, very long.

203
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 It was discovered in 1981 and when the first people went in, they didn't know they were in a big cave at all.

204
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 They thought they were in a little tunnel and so they were just feeling their way along the sides and they followed the wall for ages and it was sort of bending round.

205
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And when they'd almost come back, done full circle, they were like, "Hang on, is this just empty in the middle?

206
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Are we in a giant stadium?" And they walked through the middle of it and realised that they were.

207
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Wow, that must have been incredible. I can imagine that feeling of agriphobia actually get to the middle of that stadium and switch the lights off.

208
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 I mean, you'd think you were just floating in space. It would just be incredible.

209
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Yeah, it sounds incredible.

210
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 The other thing, having done some caving as well, the fear of getting lost because, of course, caving is all about following known features and finding your way back in the middle of that thing.

211
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 How do you work out which way you're going to go?

212
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 I wondered that. Yeah, just wandering around it forever because you kind of forget when you see pictures of caves that obviously very well photographed and you do forget that you are in pitch darkness basically all the time on you except for a tiny light in front of your face.

213
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Yeah.

214
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 But why is there no, why is no one's set up some sort of breadcrumbs system whereby you can follow, you know, luminous breadcrumbs or glow sticks?

215
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Hansel and Gretel.

216
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Yeah, what's going on?

217
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 I'm sure there are directions, aren't there?

218
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Maybe.

219
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Directions.

220
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 You've got a compass. Do you take a compass there?

221
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Yeah, if the rocks aren't, you know, if there's not too much metal content, iron content in the rocks, I guess you could try a compass or just have a little bit of string.

222
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Use the cave diver method.

223
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Yes.

224
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 We mentioned the Sondun cave in Vietnam ages ago as an example of another extremely big cave, but I didn't, I think we said that it has clouds that form in it.

225
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 That's how tall it is, but I didn't know this.

226
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 It's got a jungle in it.

227
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 It's got proper sort of, you know, virgin jungle, 600 feet below the surface of the earth.

228
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 And it's also this jungle I read is home to the only underground monkeys on the planet.

229
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Cool.

230
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 The only monkeys in the world that live their lives underground, which I've really hope is true.

231
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Well, where have you read?

232
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 I mean, I read it in a reliable source.

233
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Well, it's supposed to be professional researchers and sources, Andy.

234
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 I hope it's true as well.

235
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 You've just said it.

236
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Yeah.

237
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 That is unbelievably cool.

238
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 That is cool.

239
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I guess they've evolved to suit their habitat.

240
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 So I wonder what, you know, how different they are to, you know, other monkeys in the region that are outside the cave.

241
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 It feels like they're a really good backup for all life forms on earth.

242
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 And then if we all, if we all go to the some accident nuclear or something, at least those monkeys will probably be fine.

243
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Yes.

244
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Yes.

245
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 But it's got a big gaping hole at the top, right?

246
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 As in it's not underground monkeys.

247
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 They're just subterranean.

248
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 There has to be some light.

249
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Yeah.

250
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 For the trees to, for the jungle to survive.

251
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Yeah.

252
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Nice.

253
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 You do often get actually in these massive caves, birds, you get little swiftlets.

254
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 So this is in the biggest cave by volume, which is actually in China.

255
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 So the other one is the biggest cave by area.

256
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 And the swiftlets are the birds out of which you make bird nest soup in China.

257
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 And so that's why a lot of people go caving in there to collect that, although I think they've commercialized bird nest soup and they've just started farming them these days.

258
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 But it sounds really sweet.

259
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 I was reading about someone who went to sort of stay in that cave for a couple of months and said that you lie down on the ground and the swiftlets will just land on your

260
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 chest and let themselves be petted.

261
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Wow.

262
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 That's really sweet.

263
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 It is.

264
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 That's great.

265
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And they make the nest out of saliva, don't they?

266
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 It's all saliva birds nest soup, basically, I think.

267
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 It's strands of the whole bird nest is this white, these white threads.

268
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Oh, I thought those twigs held together with saliva.

269
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 I think it's pretty much all saliva glands with a little bit of paraphernalia to cushion it.

270
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 You've never been tempted to try some, though.

271
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 It's not the best.

272
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 It's quite a high price to pay for something apparently tasteless.

273
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 If you're trapped down there and hungry, I think I'd give it a go, definitely.

274
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 You definitely would, actually.

275
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 You're right.

276
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Just let the birds land on you, build their nest on you, and then...

277
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Feeding it.

278
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Yeah.

279
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 So frustrating for the bird.

280
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 What's happened to it?

281
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 I looked away for one second.

282
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Caves are quite important for training for things like space, actually, aren't they?

283
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And training for how humans are going to survive in isolation, I think.

284
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 So quite a lot of people do this weird thing where they experiment on themselves by going deep into caves

285
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 and staying there for ages.

286
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And I think the king of that is this amazing guy called Michel Sif,

287
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 who's this sort of geologist who's basically been bedding down deep in caves for over 50 years

288
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 for various long amounts of time.

289
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And the first time he did it, he was 1972, and he spent six months, 440 foot inside a Texas cave, in fact.

290
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 So maybe just avoiding the heat.

291
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 And they learned so many interesting things, but the weirdest thing is the sleep cycle

292
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 and how our sleep cycle changes.

293
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 So he would fall asleep for sort of 30 hours and think he just had a short nap.

294
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Whoa.

295
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 And so one day he had lasted 52 hours.

296
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 On his 63rd day inside, as in the 63rd time he'd woken up, 77 days had passed above ground.

297
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 So it seems like our days really lengthen when we're underground.

298
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 But it sounds awful. I don't know why he kept doing it.

299
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 He said he was so lonely he contemplated suicide.

300
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 And this is the first time he's done it like seven times since.

301
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 There's an awful story in his diary where he's just staying alone.

302
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 He writes a diary every night.

303
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 And when he first went down, he killed a bunch of mice who were infesting his little chamber.

304
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 And then after a few weeks he realized he really wanted a friend.

305
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 And he saw a mouse and he thought, oh my God, that's my friend.

306
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 He's going to keep me company through these awful months.

307
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 And he spread some jam on the floor and then put a little pee next to it to lure this mouse in.

308
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 And he slammed a bowl down over it to catch it and he crushed the mouse.

309
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 No.

310
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 It just sounds like surely the worst moment of his life.

311
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 What a shame.

312
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Because I imagine in his head, this was the Hollywood moment where a man underground

313
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 with a mouse for a best friend, you know, like, but then he ruined it.

314
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Totally ruined it.

315
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Yeah.

316
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 There's actually a woman called Josie Law, who's the woman who spent the most time alone in a cave.

317
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And she did successfully befriend a white mouse.

318
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Oh, that's something.

319
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Yeah, that's something.

320
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Yeah.

321
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 I read that account of Seifra and his mouse.

322
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 I think he said later on that he didn't remember it.

323
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Because obviously you forget time when it's all, you know, similar and monotonous.

324
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Yeah.

325
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 But he did keep a diary.

326
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 So he wrote in the diary, I killed the mouse and it's.

327
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 I'd love to know what he felt when it came out.

328
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Okay.

329
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 With that kind of sensory overload of being deprived of all those senses for so long.

330
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Yeah.

331
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Because I mean, when I came out after just seven days, it was as if somebody had turned contrast

332
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 up on the telly to full.

333
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 The sky was this brilliant blue and you could smell the moss under the trees and everything

334
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 was just an overdrive.

335
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 It only lasted for about 30 minutes.

336
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 But it kind of made me realize that we get so used to our limited senses and other animals,

337
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 you know, have these incredible senses that it would be wonderful.

338
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 I'd love to be able to smell like a dog or a polar bear and just to explore their world

339
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 and, you know, or have the, you know, the eyesight of owls and be able to see what they see at

340
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 nighttime.

341
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 So I think you've been underground.

342
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 That was in a Sardinian, a cave complex in Sardinia.

343
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 There's about 15 kilometers of unexplored cave.

344
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And that was fascinating, Anna, about the time because we were actually deprived of sleep

345
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 down there.

346
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 That was part of the excite.

347
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 They took our watches away.

348
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 So we had no idea, no concept of time.

349
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 And when you woken up after about two hours and told that we'd had eight hour sleep, so

350
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 now crack on with your next day's work, which we, Julie, did, feeling a little tired come

351
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 the third or fourth day thinking, why am I so exhausted?

352
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And of course, of course, you're only getting two hours sleep a night without thinking you're

353
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 getting a good eight hours.

354
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 And then you get told after you wake up on the seventh morning thinking, OK, I'm leaving

355
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 the cave today.

356
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 No, no, no, no, no.

357
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 You've got another three days to go.

358
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 So that was not allowing us to get into our natural cycles.

359
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 It's fascinating to think the body actually goes the other way in a cave and you actually

360
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 lengthen your days and lengthen the amount of time you sleep.

361
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Were you angry when you sort of woke up and they were like, punked you?

362
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 You're only getting two hours sleep a night.

363
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Yeah, but that was the whole point.

364
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 They were trying to make us angry through the whole exercise.

365
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 It was all about trying to push you to, you know, so that there'd be conflict between you

366
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 as a team.

367
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And you had to be a substitute to learn how to deal with the pressure of being cold, wet,

368
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 tired and hungry.

369
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 And if they could instigate a little bit of conflict amongst you as a team, of course,

370
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 then you're able to explore those psychological aspects as well.

371
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 I mean, it was all really beneficial training for the space station.

372
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 But I'm not sure I would voluntarily spend six months down the cave.

373
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 I mean, that's an awful long time.

374
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Was there conflict?

375
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 There was a dead rival somewhere deep within this cave.

376
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Someone who never made it.

377
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Is it like the experience of coming out where you describe this incredible sensory overload

378
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 and, you know, you can smell the moss and the sunlight has never been brighter.

379
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Is it like having been to the cinema in the daytime?

380
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Because for me, that's, I think, as close as I'll ever get in my life.

381
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 I fell to my knees, I kissed the ear, all of it.

382
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 You know, Brian Blessed says that when he came down from Mount Everest, there was so much

383
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 sensory overload for him that he could see the molecular makeup of flowers when he looked

384
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 at them.

385
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 He could see the cells of his hand.

386
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Yeah, he said his eyes were so heightened in their clarity.

387
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Don't degrade the quality of truth you're getting from Tim here with your Brian Blessed bullshit.

388
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Go more back to Andy's side.

389
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Is it like when you come out of IKEA after shopping for six hours?

390
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Keep it observational.

391
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 There's a great word that I love, which is associated with caves, which is Berenschliff.

392
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 And this is a word that means the smooth polished surfaces of a cave wall caused by the fur of

393
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 a passing cave bear.

394
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 This is the story.

395
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 It's believed that cave bears, they wallow in mud and they do that so they can loosen

396
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 parasites that are on their fur and the solids that are contained in the mud in connection

397
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 with the hair that they have as they pass wall, acts like a sandpaper.

398
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 So after time and time and time again, it smooths the rock wall into this polished surface.

399
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 And it's a surface that you can only get polished if done by the specific method of a bear doing

400
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 it.

401
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 So yeah, Berenschliff.

402
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Wow.

403
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Thank you very much.

404
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And Brian, bless and tell you that.

405
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Oh, that's so cool.

406
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 That sounds like a German thing.

407
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 It sounds like an obscure German gentleman, Berenschliff.

408
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Ropping up against a cave.

409
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 There's a cave in Slovenia, which has a train inside it, which is so much fun.

410
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 The postagna cave.

411
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And it was designed to replace the sedanches, which were the original means of getting around

412
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 the cave.

413
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 They were for royals, obviously only, but when these caves were discovered, it was the mid-19th

414
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 century.

415
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 And, you know, millions and millions of years have passed in the cave when they were unknown.

416
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And so, yeah, they then got sedanches.

417
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Then they got a train, which was hand pulled.

418
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 So Victorian tourists would visit and just be pulled along by laborers.

419
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 And then eventually, because it's so horizontal in the cave, they've built a little mini Disneyland

420
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 inside it.

421
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Oh, caving was a different experience, wasn't it?

422
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 To having read some of the quite hardcore experiences of cave as today, getting carried down in a

423
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 sedan chair did not feature anywhere.

424
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 I'd be up for it if it did.

425
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 It does sound quite dangerous.

426
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Andy Evis, I think, is sort of this absolute legend.

427
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 He's the great spelunker of our age.

428
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And he was the first person to explore this good luck cave, actually.

429
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 And he just such mad stuff happened.

430
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Like at one point there was a huge flood and they got trapped deep inside a cave.

431
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And one of the people on their team had to do this extremely long free dive, which they call a self rescue.

432
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Where, you know, you just have to swim down under the flood and swim and swim and hope that you get out.

433
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And I think a photographer split his thigh open and they had to trek overnight through the rainforest.

434
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 When the doctor arrived to fix his leg, a tree fell through the roof of their camp just and landed just next to him.

435
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 They all got fever from rat poison, I think.

436
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Was that a thing Tim, they warn you about? Apparently everyone's feet get eaten away by gross bacteria.

437
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Man, your feet have taken a beating, Tim.

438
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Between space and caves.

439
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Yeah, that's why the skin falls off.

440
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 There's nothing to do with the pedicure you get from space.

441
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 It's the rat poison.

442
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Yeah, we thankfully didn't come across any bears or rats on our caving expedition.

443
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 In the wrong caves.

444
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Absolutely.

445
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 You did have that, didn't you, where you went through somewhere on an early caving adventure.

446
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 You went through a narrow tunnel and then you read the directions later on.

447
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 This was back in the highly irresponsible days of my 20s when we were just...

448
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 We were actually rock climbing and abseiling a lot and kayaking at the weekends in Wales.

449
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 And we saw a couple of people just pop out the side of the rock face and got speaking to them.

450
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 They said, "This area is riddled with caves."

451
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 And so we thought, "That's it. Next weekend we'll do some caving then."

452
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 And literally kind of had a couple of maglites each and a Kit Kat.

453
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 And on off we went into this cave complex with a rough sketch of what it was.

454
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 And literally a photocopied couple of pages out the guidebook.

455
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 And it wasn't until we were about two hours into the cave having gone through these very, very narrow presses

456
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 that Dave, my friend, read the second page of the guide and said,

457
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 "If there was a noticeable flow of water through this thing called the pebble flow,

458
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 you should abandon the cave immediately because it's prone to flooding.

459
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 And it had been pouring with rain outside."

460
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 And the pebble crawl was about 45 minutes back from where we'd come

461
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 and the water had been up to our elbows as we went through this thing.

462
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 So we suddenly realised we needed to get out of this thing in a hurry

463
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 and by the time we got back to the pebble crawl, we had about three inches of where we could breathe

464
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 along this 20-foot kind of tunnel.

465
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 So we were going through there with our chins tilted upwards

466
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 and we were so close to being trapped down there.

467
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Were you still sort of holding the paper of the photocopy bits of the guidebook

468
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 just above the water level?

469
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 We'd given up on it.

470
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 I don't think we ever got that bit of paper back again.

471
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 But we realised quite how irresponsible we'd been after that

472
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 and we treated that environment with a bit more care and respect

473
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 and came back the following weekend a bit better prepared.

474
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 But that was a good lesson.

475
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 That was a good lesson in that.

476
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 It's reading page two of the instructions. That seems to be a big thing.

477
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 It is kind of like when you get to the end of cooking something

478
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 and it says, "Serve with the pre-prepared grilled vegetables from page 72."

479
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Yeah, or leave to set in the fridge for 48 hours.

480
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 We'll guess we're arriving in 10 minutes.

481
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Basically, there's nothing that exciting that you can tell us, Tim,

482
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 that we can't compare it to something much more boring.

483
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 OK, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

484
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 My fact is that Chicago has an alcoholic spirit which tastes so bad

485
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 that its own founder used to boast that only one in 49 men liked it.

486
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Who was the one?

487
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 So this is a thing called Jepsen's Millort,

488
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 a founder by a man called Carl Jepsen.

489
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And it's a kind of spiced liqueur which is flavoured with wormwood.

490
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And yeah, mostly known in Chicago,

491
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 but it's drunk in a few other places.

492
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 But I've tried it and it is really, really an acquired taste.

493
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 And the back of the bottle had this label which said,

494
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 "Most first-time drinkers of Jepsen Millort reject our liquor."

495
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 During almost 60 years of American distribution,

496
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 we found only one out of 49 men would drink it.

497
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 It is rugged and unrelenting, even brutal to the palate.

498
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 The whole label is just trying to say, "You're not going to like this."

499
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Wow, I'm amazed that you've tried it, Andy.

500
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 You're a man who has an extra squeeze of lime in his soda water on a wild night out.

501
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 I've actually tried it as well.

502
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 I tried it on the last night of our US tour for fish when we were in Washington DC.

503
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 I couldn't remember if we both had it on the same night.

504
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 It was the worst thing.

505
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 You tried it together with each other.

506
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 This is how pungent and painful it was.

507
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 I don't remember Andy being there when I tried it.

508
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 He clearly doesn't remember being there.

509
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 It's horrific.

510
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 It's utterly disgusting.

511
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 I am one of the 48, and I agree with Tim.

512
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 I want to know who this one guy is.

513
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Actually, I know who this one guy is.

514
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 One guy that we know who drinks it is a comedian who's been on our show, John Hodgman,

515
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 who has it as his preferred drink.

516
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 Really, because I read a quote from John saying it tastes like pencil shavings and heartbreaks.

517
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 That is a bizarre preference for him to have.

518
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 But he just loves that.

519
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 It's not such a wonderful description.

520
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 It's like pencil shavings and heartbreaks.

521
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 How would you describe it?

522
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 I would just say it's overwhelmingly better.

523
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 But they've asked more eloquent people than me.

524
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 So they don't have many employees.

525
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 It's quite a small firm, Jepsen's Mallort.

526
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 But in the past, they've asked the public for slogans.

527
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 And the slogans that have come back have been things like,

528
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 "Mallort, what soap, what is its mouth out with?"

529
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 "Mallort, kick your mouth in the balls."

530
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 And my favourite, "Mallort, these pants aren't going to shit themselves."

531
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Stunning. We've got to employ that person for our PR.

532
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 So it's got Wyrmwood in it, right?

533
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 Similar to Absence.

534
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 And which has a bad reputation, Wyrmwood.

535
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 And maybe unjustifiably.

536
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Do you remember when we were all younger and everyone claimed

537
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 that Absence was illegal, was the first claim.

538
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 And the second claim was that the Wyrmwood in it,

539
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 that's now illegal, makes you hallucinate and sends you mad.

540
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Did everyone have something for these kids?

541
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Dimly, yeah.

542
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 But none of it's true?

543
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Not true.

544
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 No, although it was banned for years,

545
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 because people thought it was true.

546
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 So it was Absence was what, you know,

547
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 all your van goffs and all your crazy artists

548
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 and writers of the 19th century were drinking,

549
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 especially in France.

550
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 And it was thought to be responsible for the degeneration

551
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 of French society, I think.

552
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 And it was, it was banned in France.

553
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 And the justification was that Wyrmwood sends you mad

554
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 and gives you hallucinations.

555
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 And it was only in the 1970s that we showed that

556
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 it's in such tiny amounts that it can't do you any harm in it.

557
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 And it's just the fact that Absence is faking strong

558
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 and full of alcohol.

559
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 But the US didn't lift the ban until 2007.

560
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Wow.

561
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 Do you know what the Russian for Wyrmwood is?

562
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 It's Chernobyl.

563
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 What?

564
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Really?

565
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 So Chernobyl was named after the Wyrmwood fields.

566
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 The town and the nuclear plant were named

567
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 after the Wyrmwood fields around it.

568
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 That is the Russian word for Wyrmwood.

569
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 Yeah.

570
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 Oh, so if you were to do this podcast in Russia

571
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 and say Wyrmwood doesn't do you any harm,

572
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 then that would not be true.

573
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 And you'd have to be very careful with the translation.

574
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Tim, you were a cocktail mixer once, right?

575
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 A long time ago, I wish I'd come across Malore then

576
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 because I think it would have been hilarious

577
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 to have served that to the customers.

578
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 What's the word?

579
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 What's Tom Cruise in Thompson?

580
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 A mixologist.

581
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Well, you know, they call that flair tending.

582
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 Flair tending.

583
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 Flair tending.

584
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 Yes.

585
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Yeah, it was an ordinary pub.

586
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 It was called the Nagshead in Jesusus.

587
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 It was an ordinary pub.

588
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 But come Thursday through Saturday, it was just heaving.

589
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 It was a great sort of young person's place to go and drink.

590
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 And we turned it into a cocktail bar for those nights.

591
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 And Olivier Barbadette was at the French head barman.

592
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 And it was all, you know, we're proper there.

593
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Black tie, waist, black waistcoats kind of thing.

594
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 So quite a sort of French influence to it.

595
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 And it was all flair tending.

596
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 And we would be spinning bottles.

597
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 We'd be throwing glasses, catching ice cubes down there.

598
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 I was just brilliant.

599
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 So much fun.

600
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 We'd practice for hours outside with empty bottles,

601
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 smashing them all over the place and having to sweep up

602
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 all the debris before opening hours.

603
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 And then Ben Off would go.

604
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 It was a huge amount of fun.

605
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 Did it ever come in handy?

606
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 Just did that training ever sort of later on the ISS?

607
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Was there a moment where--

608
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 I'm trying to think aware.

609
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 I'd love to say yes, but I honestly can't think.

610
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 But no, in terms of coming in useful,

611
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 it's got absolutely no use whatsoever.

612
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 I guess if you throw a bottle of water over your head on the ISS,

613
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 it just keeps going in the opposite direction.

614
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Exactly.

615
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 Hey, do you know who the first ever flair tender was?

616
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 As far as we know, a sort of documented case of it.

617
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Is it a famous person who we will have heard of?

618
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Absolutely not.

619
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 No.

620
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Right, OK.

621
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 This will be a tougher guess.

622
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 All right.

623
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 So start the alphabet A, Aaron.

624
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 Let's call it Aaron.

625
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 No, head down towards J, and you'll be more there.

626
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 Jerry, the Professor Thomas.

627
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 And he was an American bartender,

628
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 and he wrote what was the first ever book of fancy drinks, basically.

629
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 It was called The Bartender's Guide,

630
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 a complete cyclopedia of plain and fancy drinks.

631
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 And he used to go around to different bars all over America.

632
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 And he was the first to do tricks with spinning of the metal canisters

633
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 that you would mix a drink in,

634
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 and he would set them alight and he would transfer the flame into another glass.

635
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 But yeah, so we know who kind of the first person was.

636
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 And one of the things that he put into his cocktail book was the Tom Collins,

637
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 which I didn't realize was there's this hoax in America called the Tom Collins hoax.

638
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 Have you guys heard of that?

639
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 It used to be a game where you used to say in a bar,

640
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 if the four of us were in the bar, I'd say, "Andy,

641
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 have you heard that guy, Tom Collins, who's been talking smack about you?"

642
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 And you'd say like, "What?"

643
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 Tom Collins said this thing.

644
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 And the idea was it was a hoax where you convinced someone

645
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 that Tom Collins was talking about you and spreading rumors, making you furious.

646
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 And that's what pranks used to be back in the day.

647
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 So it's like stripy paint, isn't it?

648
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 Sending someone off a stripy paint is kind of like that.

649
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Is that a thing?

650
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 Yeah, because it should be obvious.

651
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 No, it's not a thing, Dan.

652
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 Dan's getting up to get some.

653
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 Hang on. You get stripy toothpaste.

654
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 Why don't we get stripy paint?

655
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 Do you know that it's actually an unarmed trouble argument?

656
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 That's a really, really good point.

657
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 He's outwitting them.

658
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 What do you guys think is the most popular spirit,

659
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 or the most commonly drunk spirit on Earth, or in the universe?

660
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 I love that we have to specify "on" or "on" tips on the podcast.

661
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 Yeah, we do.

662
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 I know which one it is on Earth.

663
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 On Earth, I don't know, gin is fairly popular.

664
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 I'll say whiskey.

665
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 Lots of big whiskey fans out there.

666
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 Nice. I mean, you're not going to get it.

667
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Don't think. I'll tell them I get it.

668
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 It's Baizhou, which is a Chinese liquor,

669
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 which basically is not drunk outside of China,

670
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 but is the most commonly drunk spirit in the world.

671
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Baizhou, are you saying?

672
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Baizhou is an alcohol, and Baibing white, the word.

673
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Yes, but it's a spirit.

674
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 But it's a spirit, yeah.

675
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 Yeah, it's distilled. Have you tried it?

676
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 I think I have, yeah.

677
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 It sounds familiar enough that I feel like I must have.

678
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 It sounds, I texted my friend yesterday who lives in China

679
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 and says it resembles paint stripper, but it's very popular.

680
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 But it sells more than whiskey, vodka and rum combined worldwide.

681
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 And it sounds great. There's a museum in China.

682
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 How do you pronounce it, Dan?

683
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 China.

684
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 Fuck you.

685
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 Baizhou.

686
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 Baizhou.

687
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 There's a Baizhou Museum in China,

688
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 which shows a reenactment video of when it was,

689
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 when it went global, which I think it's question,

690
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 question mark over whether it's gone global.

691
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 But apparently it went to the World Fair in San Francisco in 1915,

692
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 and all the Americans were sneering at it,

693
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 and this weird sort of earthenware jar filled with this Chinese drink.

694
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 And it made the Chinese delegates so nervous

695
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 it was smashed all over the floor.

696
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 And then the scent of it was so seduced everyone

697
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 that it won the prize that year,

698
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 and has gone down in history as everyone's favorite spirit.

699
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 Of course.

700
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 Yeah, we've all got our bottles right here, haven't we?

701
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 Yeah.

702
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 Have you heard of the six o'clock swell?

703
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 This is a thing. Heard of it? No?

704
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 No.

705
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 So this was a thing that happened in Australia, okay.

706
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 And I think Australians are sort of a kind of big drinking country.

707
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 You know, they like their drink.

708
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 There was a rule in place, a law in Australia and New Zealand,

709
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 that you had to finish your drinks.

710
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 Last orders was 6 p.m. pretty much every day, as far as I could tell.

711
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 And this lasted from 1960, when there were restrictions because of the war,

712
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 until 1967.

713
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 All license establishments had to stop serving at 6 p.m. incredibly early.

714
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 So the six o'clock swell was the final hour of legal drinking in Australia,

715
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 between 5 and 6 p.m.

716
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 Everyone would leave their work and immediately go to the bar

717
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 and start getting drinks in hand over fist,

718
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 drinking as much as they could until 6 p.m.

719
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 And then bang, the bell rang and that was the cut off.

720
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 Yeah. And it was mayhem.

721
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 What year was that?

722
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 It ended in different regions of different years in Australia,

723
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 but the final one to scrap it, scrapped it in 1967.

724
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 Yeah. It's quite late.

725
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 Your parents might remember it then.

726
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 Well, actually, so my parents would have been,

727
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 my dad would have been 10 roughly at that time.

728
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 So he remembers it very well.

729
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 But no, by weirdly, the last time I was in Australia,

730
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 I was talking to my grandfather, who was there in that period.

731
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 He's Austrian, but he'd moved over at that point.

732
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 And he was telling me exactly about this thing.

733
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 And the problem was is everyone after 6 p.m. had to drive home

734
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 and they all did it drunk as hell.

735
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 And because you'd had to drink so quick that you felt really ill.

736
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 And he said many, many days would he stop at a traffic light.

737
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 It was just people, including him,

738
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 rolling down their window,

739
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 vomiting out the window at a traffic light

740
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 and then continuing on to drive home.

741
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 So yeah, it was definitely, definitely a thing.

742
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 We are going to have to move on in a sec.

743
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 I've just got one more drink.

744
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Yeah.

745
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 Have you heard of whiz key?

746
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 No.

747
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 Okay.

748
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 This is a drink that was invented by a British entrepreneur in 2010.

749
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 He's called James Gilpin.

750
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 And whiz key is whiskey made using the sugar rich urine

751
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 of diabetes patients.

752
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 So if you have diabetes,

753
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 you have a lot of sugar in your urine sometimes.

754
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 And Gilpin has diabetes himself,

755
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 but he contacted various elderly volunteers,

756
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 including his own grandmother,

757
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 and extracted the sugar molecules from the urine,

758
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 added them to the mash stock to accelerate the fermentation.

759
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 He didn't sell it.

760
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 He said this was illegal.

761
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 But he said he was trying to make, you know,

762
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 be thought provoking about how we use the resources we have.

763
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 And actually, as obviously on the ISS,

764
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 everything is recycled to become clean drinking water.

765
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 I thought it's not as silly an idea,

766
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 but maybe it might be as well.

767
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 Yeah.

768
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 We certainly don't go making whiskey up there,

769
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 but you are reminded every day, of course,

770
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 that you're drinking your crewmates urine

771
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 that's been recycled in about 24 hours.

772
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 It's a fast turnaround as well.

773
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 It's a fast turnaround.

774
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 Does your mind ever play with you, Tim,

775
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 where you think you can taste something that's not there?

776
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 Is this definitely filtered?

777
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 I just never drank pure water.

778
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 I always mixed it with something.

779
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 It was either a tea, cup of tea,

780
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 or it was a fruit juice or something,

781
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 because to drink the pure water

782
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 was a little bit too close to the bone.

783
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 This is why you didn't need to go to the lawn

784
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 your entire space because you were refusing to drink

785
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 for your six months in a day.

786
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 You need more diabetics up there.

787
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 Yeah, clearly.

788
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 Get diabetics to sweeten the urine.

789
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 Don't even need to put sugar in the tea.

790
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

791
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 and that is my fact.

792
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 My fact this week is that Land Rover once released a manual,

793
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 which was edible, so if you got lost in the desert,

794
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 you could eat it to survive.

795
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 This was 2012.

796
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 They published this.

797
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 They published in Dubai.

798
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 It's called the Land Rover's Edible Survival Guide,

799
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 and the idea was if you got lost out in the desert,

800
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 this manual could tell you things like how to build a shelter,

801
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 how you could signal for help,

802
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 but then it became more practical as well.

803
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 The metal wiring on the inside could be removed,

804
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 and you could use it as a cooking skewer.

805
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 It had reflective packaging around it as well,

806
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 so that you could use that to make signals

807
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 so that people could see you.

808
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 But the greatest thing of all is that on the front,

809
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 it says, "In case of emergency, eat this book."

810
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 And if you did eat it, according to the people who made it,

811
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 the ink and paper, which were both edible,

812
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 had the nutritional value of a cheeseburger.

813
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 So you were actually getting a good meal out of it, yeah.

814
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 Right. So you need to have read it all first.

815
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 Yeah, you've got to be so careful.

816
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 You think which bits you're not going to need.

817
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 You don't need to know about the air conditioning system.

818
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 That can go. That's a snack.

819
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 Brilliant.

820
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 But such a clever idea.

821
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 I love survival guides,

822
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 and an edible one is the most practical of them all.

823
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 It is.

824
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 If you're desperate.

825
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 It is.

826
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 If only you'd had that inside your cave, Tim.

827
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 You could have lasted hours more in there.

828
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 Absolutely.

829
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 I know.

830
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 In the army, we used to get given these survival kits as well.

831
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 And they had tallow candles.

832
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 So it's edible candle wax.

833
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 And it was a similar thing.

834
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 But if push came to shove and you were starving

835
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 and you decided that warmth and light and heat wasn't essential,

836
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 you could just start munching your way through this tallow candle instead.

837
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 I tried some, and it was just disgusting.

838
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 I mean, you would just chew on this candle for ages,

839
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 and it wouldn't.

840
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 I mean, no matter how much saliva you could generate,

841
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 it wouldn't go into a nice, moist part.

842
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 It was just horrible.

843
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 Wow.

844
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 Is it just kind of fat tallow?

845
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 It is, isn't it?

846
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 Is it animal fat?

847
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 Yeah, I think it is.

848
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 Yes, yeah.

849
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 But they did...

850
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 What was the wick made of in the candle?

851
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 Was that licorice or something?

852
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 So you could...

853
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 No, I think that was the one that you weren't supposed to eat.

854
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 It's got to be practical as well.

855
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 Yeah, you've got to light it.

856
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 Also, apparently, sometimes it's a bad idea to eat

857
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 if you're lost in the desert,

858
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 because the process of digesting food actually uses up a lot of water.

859
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 So if you're really lost,

860
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 the idea is that maybe you should limit yourself to drinking.

861
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 And also, I didn't realise that.

862
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 One page a day.

863
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 A page a day.

864
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 Yeah, exactly.

865
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 A line of text every few hours.

866
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 But also, you shouldn't drink in small sips,

867
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 which I think is quite useful,

868
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 because if I were stranded in the desert,

869
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 I think I would be really conservative

870
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 and I only have a few sips of water at a time.

871
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 But apparently, that means that your body doesn't...

872
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 It doesn't launch the body's process

873
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 that causes it to store the water.

874
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 So it just loses it straight away.

875
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 So the recommendation is that if you're lost in the desert,

876
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 you drink water maybe three to four times a day in a big batch,

877
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 and that's the way that it'll store it

878
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 and then, you know, actually be useful.

879
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 Wow.

880
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 Yeah.

881
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 Didn't know that.

882
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 That's very useful.

883
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 They didn't teach us that during survival training.

884
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 There you go.

885
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 There you go, guys.

886
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 We all could have died.

887
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 Saved a lot of lives today.

888
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 Slightly less useful survival tip, possibly,

889
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 is that you know how...

890
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 So this fact is about something that's normally non-edible,

891
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 but that turns out to be edible.

892
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 Here's a fact about something edible

893
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 that you can use for non-edible purposes,

894
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 which is that you can use Doritos to build a fire.

895
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 What?

896
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 Because they're so covered in the sort of cheesy, flammable dust

897
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 that they go up quite easily.

898
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 It's short-term fire.

899
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 It's fire lighters, rather than...

900
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 You wouldn't have an entire fire without a Doritos.

901
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 It's kindling, exactly.

902
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 Could you clarify that?

903
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 Because we're going to get very angry emails from Dubai

904
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 when my Dorito fire went out in two seconds.

905
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 I mean, a lot of things can set on fire, can't they?

906
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 Yeah, true.

907
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 But I thought for a second,

908
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 maybe you could start a fire with Doritos

909
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 by sort of rubbing one against the other.

910
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 So that is genuinely good that you clarify.

911
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 Sometimes if you open a packet of Doritos,

912
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 have you noticed that there's nothing but ash

913
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 in the bottom of it?

914
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 Do you guys know the US military's Universal Edibility Test?

915
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 I don't know if the British military has an equivalent, but...

916
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 No.

917
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 Well, this...

918
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 Did they ever teach you, Tim,

919
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 like if you're stranded anywhere,

920
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 how to identify stuff that's poisonous or not?

921
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 Well, they told us, you know,

922
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 put a bit on your lip for 10 minutes,

923
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 and then if your lip's not tingling and numb,

924
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 then go under the tongue for 20 minutes,

925
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 and you do this incremental process.

926
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
 And eventually, there's a small quantity,

927
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 you get stomach ache, and eventually you can work out

928
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 whether your body can tolerate it or not.

929
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 You bang on.

930
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 They've nicked it off the brits.

931
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 Yeah.

932
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 So you do get taught that.

933
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 It's a very long process, isn't it?

934
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 If you're starving.

935
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 It's very long, yeah.

936
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 Especially the bit that's, like,

937
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 swallow a tiny bit, wait for eight hours.

938
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Eat a page of your manual in between.

939
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 I think the Italian army is the only modern one

940
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 which gives out alcohol in its standard military rations

941
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 to its troops.

942
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 The Guardian ran a huge piece about, you know,

943
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 all sorts of different countries,

944
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 and the sometimes very stereotypical things they have.

945
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
 So the French army, they get dear pâté,

946
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 cassoulet with duck confit,

947
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 small caramel pudding, mini baguette.

948
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 They go super French.

949
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 But the Italian army, I think,

950
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 there's the only one out of the ones they tried,

951
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 which gives you a shot of alcohol, 40%,

952
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 just to keep your spirits up, I guess.

953
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 Fantastic.

954
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 I know that the French rations,

955
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 they used to give out a small,

956
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 one of those kind of airline bottles of red wine.

957
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 They probably stopped doing that now.

958
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 But that just puts in comparison to British, you know,

959
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
 where we get biscuits A-B.

960
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 I have no idea what the A-B stands for.

961
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 But the rations are just dreadful,

962
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
 designed to bung you up,

963
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
 to stop you having the need to go to the loo

964
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 so frequently when you're on exercise

965
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 or digging trenches or things like that.

966
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 Did you get mini-tobasco with your ration packs?

967
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 The US, yes.

968
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 Yeah, the US ration packs there,

969
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 MREs, meals ready to eat.

970
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 And they've got these brilliant chemical heaters.

971
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 So, you know, the British rations,

972
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
 we're still on lighting your solid fuel tablets

973
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 and you have a little stove to warm up the water.

974
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
 But no, America, you just rub the chemicals together,

975
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 break the packages and heats up chemically.

976
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 And it gets really, really hot.

977
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 So, it's a fantastic way of having a meal ready to go.

978
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 And they give you a little tabasco sachet in there,

979
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 or a small bottle of tabasco.

980
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
 That's so sweet.

981
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 What they're not telling you is

982
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 they're all told to keep a Dorito in their back pocket.

983
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 Yeah.

984
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 That's the key.

985
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
 My favourite survival meal that I learned about

986
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
 was one that Shackleton had,

987
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
 which I'd never read about on his Antarctic expedition,

988
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 the endurance expedition.

989
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 His crew at one point,

990
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 and this was, like, well into it when they were like,

991
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 "We're going to die now. We are stranded and lost."

992
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 They were attacked by a leopard seal,

993
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 which very occasionally do attack humans.

994
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
 And, in fact, I think did kill someone a while back.

995
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
 So, they were attacked by a leopard seal,

996
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 and one of the crew managed to shoot it.

997
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 Not only that, when they split it open,

998
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 its stomach was absolutely packed

999
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
 with completely undigested fish.

1000
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
 Oh, wow.

1001
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 So, they just got a soup case of fish.

1002
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
 It's like a pinata.

1003
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
 It's like a pinata.

1004
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
 Stinking pinata.

1005
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
 I found there's a classic survival guide book,

1006
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 which is the SAS Survival Guide,

1007
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
 and it was written in 1987 by a guy called John Lofty Wiseman.

1008
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 And this has sold millions and millions of copies,

1009
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 and he's quite an amazing character,

1010
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
 generally, to read into his story.

1011
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 He's the guy who helped set up the SAS counter-terrorist team,

1012
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 and they were the ones that went into the Iranian embassy

1013
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
 when that big incident happened.

1014
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
 So, he was part of the people that set that up.

1015
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 And he wrote this book, which is just packed

1016
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
 with very good, useful advice,

1017
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
 but also strays into territories where you think,

1018
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
 "When is this ever going to be a part of my life?"

1019
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 For example, How to Kill an Octopus is a section.

1020
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 And he gives you three options of how to kill the octopus,

1021
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 and a couple of them are quite normal,

1022
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 sort of using a knife stab it between the eyes

1023
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 or bang it against the rock.

1024
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
 But one of the options is to thrust your hand

1025
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
 inside of the octopus into its flesh hood

1026
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 and pull by its innards and flip it inside out,

1027
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 like you would like a washing glove, you know,

1028
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 like a marigold, I read in the article,

1029
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
 being pulled the other way out.

1030
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 That's one of his sort of basic options for you to kill an octopus.

1031
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
 So, and then it has, you know,

1032
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 lots of like basic stuff about how to lure animals

1033
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 and pray in and get water and so on.

1034
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
 Yeah, pretty spectacular.

1035
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 He must have been absolutely terrifying at children's parties,

1036
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
 turning up with his octopus glove puppet.

1037
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 It's amazing you said that.

1038
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
 I've actually got that book on my bookshelf,

1039
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 because I think I was about 13 or 14,

1040
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 and it was given as a present, and I loved it.

1041
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
 I absolutely loved it.

1042
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
 The SAS survived.

1043
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
 But you're absolutely right, and I remember as well,

1044
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
 and I haven't read this, you know, for 30 plus years,

1045
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
 but there was a bit in there that said about how to stop a car.

1046
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
 If you're going down a hill, the brakes fail,

1047
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
 and the handbrake fails, you can use a wall

1048
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
 and just scrape the car along the side of the wall to slow you down.

1049
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
 And I was thinking, when am I ever going to need it?

1050
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
 But it's something I remembered all of my life,

1051
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
 and I'm 48, and I haven't yet been going down a hill

1052
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 and all the brakes have failed.

1053
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
 But I'm waiting for that moment when I can scrape my car

1054
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
 along the wall, and thank you, Lofty.

1055
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
 Thank you for saving the day.

1056
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
 That's so good. Fingers crossed.

1057
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
 You're going to trust a guy whose name is Lofty Wiseman, aren't you?

1058
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
 I'll do anything he tells me.

1059
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
 That's very good.

1060
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
 We should probably wrap up in a sec, guys.

1061
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
 Sure.

1062
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 This is slightly off the topic of survival,

1063
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
 but it's just one more thing about food and sort of food for survival

1064
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
 and food preservation.

1065
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
 So the first ever tin cans of food,

1066
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 they were invented in the early 19th century,

1067
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
 and get this, every single one of them had spent a month

1068
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
 at a temperature of at least 90 degrees Celsius

1069
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
 before being sold a solid month at 90 degrees.

1070
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
 That's going to be overcooked.

1071
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
 I think they would have been quite overcooked.

1072
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
 Yeah, I don't think there were delicacies inside.

1073
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
 They were made by a man called Brian Donkin,

1074
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
 who was a Northumbrian engineer,

1075
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
 and that was the quality control for it to spend a month

1076
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
 at about 190 to 100 degrees Celsius.

1077
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
 Really?

1078
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 I just find that amazing.

1079
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 Just to cook everything out of it that could do you any harm.

1080
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
 Yeah, the canning process.

1081
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
 I learned a bit about that when we were looking at the food

1082
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
 for going up into space,

1083
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
 and we ran it as a competition to kind of design a meal for the day

1084
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
 with all the right nutrients and minerals and vitamins.

1085
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
 And then the winners of the competition got to cook it

1086
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
 with Heston Blumenthal,

1087
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
 and he didn't want to tin the food,

1088
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
 because it's just, from a chef's point of view,

1089
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
 it just destroys it, this whole canning process.

1090
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
 Like you say, you have to have it at these really, really high temperatures,

1091
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 but we ended up having to put a lot of it into cans anyway.

1092
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
 He went through 25 different types of bread

1093
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
 before he found the ideal bread

1094
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
 that could make a bacon sandwich,

1095
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
 and you could pop the tin after 18 months,

1096
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
 and it would still be fresh, buttery, nice and warm,

1097
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
 and taste like a good bacon sandwich.

1098
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
 But the bacon looked disgusting,

1099
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
 because everything in the whole canning process

1100
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
 is just cooked to oblivion

1101
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
 to enable it to last so long.

1102
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
 Of course, the other one is the irradiation

1103
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
 from the foil pouches that we have,

1104
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
 and that all gets put through this process

1105
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
 for, again, for long-term preservation,

1106
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
 so it doesn't really matter what you do.

1107
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 None of the food is going to come out of a packet

1108
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
 or a tin tasting particularly good.

1109
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
 Heston Tabasco.

1110
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
 Heston Blumenthal would not survive long on the ISS.

1111
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
 I sense if he's refusing to touch anything,

1112
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
 it has to be tinned.

1113
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
 And is it true, Tim,

1114
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
 that Doritos are not actually allowed on the ISS

1115
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
 because it's effectively a small bomb?

1116
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
 It's a fire hazard.

1117
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
 Yeah.

1118
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
 Well, they were, but after listening to this podcast,

1119
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
 they're probably going to get removed from the list.

1120
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
 We'll have a lot of angry astronauts now

1121
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
 who won't be able to have their Doritos in space.

1122
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
 OK, that's it. That is all of our facts.

1123
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 Thank you so much for listening.

1124
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000

 Or you could go to certain book-buying websites

1138
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
 and get the new autobiography "Limitless" by Tim Peak.

1139
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
 It is the story of everything that he's done in his life,

1140
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
 from being in the military through to flying test pilot helicopters

1141
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
 and planes, getting into space, getting back down again.

1142
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
 Andy's just finished it, and you loved it, Andy.

1143
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
 It's so good. It's so exciting. It's so interesting. It's great.

1144
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
 Yeah, "Limitless" is out now.

1145
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
 See you again next week with another episode.

1146
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
 Goodbye.
