00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hi guys, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show, we wanted to say that we have a special guest on.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 It is none other than Major Tim Peake, soldier, pilot, astronaut, absolutely everything.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 He is the first British astronaut to go into space with the European Space Agency.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 He has done so many amazing things in his life, and part of the reason he's on is that he's got a new book out, it's his autobiography, it's called Limitless.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 I've just finished it, it is so amazing the stuff he's done. He spent years flying helicopters, being a helicopter test pilot.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 He was in the army, he talks about going to Sandhurst, he's done all these incredible things.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 The number of adventures in the book, basically every single page has a new exciting weird thing he's done in it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 He lived underwater for a while, that didn't even make it into the podcast.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 We didn't even mention the fact that he lived underwater. That's how many interesting things he has to say about his life so far.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 So we hope you liked the episode, and if you do, you should give his book a look.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 It is called Limitless, and it is out now from all book shops.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Even if the book shops aren't actually open, it can be ordered.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Okay, on with the podcast.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tyshinski, and special guest.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 It's Britain's first ever, and currently only ever space walking astronaut, Major Tim Peake.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Major Tim.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Well, my fact of the week is that when you do a space walk, you have to wear 16 layers of clothing and a nappy.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Was that definitely not a prank from the other astronauts, the nappy?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 I thought it might be, you know, when you get told the fancy dress party, and you turn up and everyone's wearing normal clothes.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 No, so the nappy is very, what we call a nappy, we call it a mag, a maximum absorbency garment,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 so that we don't have to go around calling it a diaper or a nappy. But it's a nappy, it's an adult nappy.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 And that gives us an ease of mind to know that at any point during a space walk, if you need to go for a week, you can just let it go.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 And is it like a standard nappy, just sort of a big wooly mess on your bum?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 I don't have children, I think, but I think that's what a nappy basically is, isn't it? Or is it more advanced?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 No, it's a standard adult incontinence pad nappy. So you put it on and you've got two Velcro type straps on the left and on the right,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 and you just, you know, tighten yourself up. And then we wear some long johns over the top of that.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 So that's layer number two, long johns and a kind of long sleeve top.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Layer number three is what's called an LCBG, a liquid cooling ventilation garment.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 And that's pretty cool, actually. It's a it's a onesie that has got about almost a kilometres worth of piping, thin rubber piping going through it.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 And that's where the water flows through. And that's what regulates our temperature out on a spacewalk.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 And then it's into the space suit. And that's where the other 14 layers of clothing.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Oh, I thought you were going to be able to list every single layer individually.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Well, I could, it might go on a bit. We might need more time for the podcast.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 I was reading about the procurement procedure behind these garments, maximum absorption garments.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 So apparently they were made by a firm called Absorbancies, and they've gone bust, but NASA bought so many.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 They bought 3,200 of these in the late 90s, and they've still got some of them knocking around.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 But it seemed like they must be running short by now, you would say.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Well, you don't need many, do you? You don't need. I mean, I read that astronauts are only really given three.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 One for takeoff, one for re-entry. And if you're going on a spacewalk, there's your third nappy.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Is that right? Training? Training? You need to practice?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 We do. You absolutely right down at Houston, we have this big old swimming pool, the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 And we wear them there as well, because we train exactly as we would do a spacewalk.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 And so although we're only in the water for six hours, we still wear them so that we know what it feels like.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 And in fact, the advice was, because going through training, you never need to go.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 But the advice from some flown astronauts was, Tim, at least once, just have a wee in your space.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Because he said, you don't want to do anything for the first time on a spacewalk.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 You want to have tried everything. So you know what it feels like, you know, it works.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 At least do it once during training.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 And did you have to do it on the spacewalk?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 I didn't. No, actually, I was very fortunate.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 I perhaps should have probably to tell you that I was very dehydrated.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Because we put that thing on, we start getting dressed at seven o'clock in the morning on spacewalk there.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 You're up at six thirty. And then you do your medical.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 You put a chest harness on, which has got monitors, your heart rate and breathing rate.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 And then you're into a space suit quite soon.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 So you end up spending somewhere about, you know, 10 to 12 hours in that space suit.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 But no, thankfully, I didn't need to use it.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Yeah, you've got to start drinking more.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 That is a long time.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 OK, I read something that I really wanted to check because I don't think you mentioned this in the book,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 but it might be sort of a previous astronaut procedure,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 which is that sometimes you would have to spend the night before you do your spacewalk in a cupboard wearing your space suit.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 So that you can get all the nitrogen out of your blood so you don't suffer.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 You know, you don't get bubbles forming at this kind of thing for a danger.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Yeah, actually, and you're partly right there because what we used to do is that they used to scamp out in the airlock.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 And so it wasn't a cupboard.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 They would actually kind of take their sleeping bags in there and they would be breathing oxygen at a lower pressure in the airlock all night long.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 And that was flushing the nitrogen out of their system.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 But it was not comfortable and it was, you know, people were getting up very tired on spacewalk morning.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 And we've gradually we've become more and more comfortable with actually reducing that period of time.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 But it's just the same as a diver trying to prevent themselves from getting the bends because inside the space suit,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 we take the pressure down to about 4.3 PSI, so less than a third of the atmosphere.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 It's slightly higher than Mount Everest, the equivalent pressure, which is pretty low actually.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 And so you don't want to go into that low pressure environment with a whole stack of nitrogen in your bloodstream.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Wow.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 And then when you were out there, I was reading to be fair, quite old article of 1984 when the first woman did a spacewalk.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 I think it was Lanna Savitskaya and she was a cosmonaut and she went out to do some welding.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 And the article about that said that, and I don't think I can believe this,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 that they're so kind of uncomfortable and inelastic back then that you could lose up to three kilograms as in almost half a stone in the course of a spacewalk.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Which I think that's impossible. I think dieters would be doing this left, right and centre of that level of weight loss was possible.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 Let's do the spacewalk diet.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Exactly. Very expensive, but does work. Is it uncomfortable and heavy?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 It is uncomfortable and it's hard work. You are really working hard because although it's a very, very low pressure,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 compared to the vacuum outside, you feel like, you know, Michelin man in this blown up tire and bending of fingers, moving your arms is exhausting and just moving around in space is exhausting.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 So you do come back physically, absolutely exhausted, but three kilograms, three kilograms sounds like an awful lot.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 And I tended to not believe the article the moment you said welding.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 Because, you know, we take risks on a spacewalk, but I don't think we'd go out there welding just in case.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 The suits sound pretty amazing. I was reading that the gloves have a inbuilt heater system.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 You know, like when you sit in a car and someone presses that button, you know, the driver presses the button in the back of your seat, something gets hot.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 You're like, whoa, they have that on the spacesuits just above the fingernails on the gloves with a non off button on the wrist.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 I believe so. Is that right to him? That's so cool.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 That's absolutely right. Yeah. So the little it's a little tab that you pull on the top of your wrist.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 And when we're going into night, actually, we get mission control call up and they just say, guys, you know, you're 25 seconds away from from nighttime helmets, gloves and visors.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 And so what they want there is helmet lights, switch them on visors, because we'll often have the gold visor down in the daytime for sun protection.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 So gold visors up and then gloves switch them on so your fingers stay nice and warm.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 And that is actually that's the only source of heat other than body heat to keep us warm on a spacewalk.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 And I guess that just goes to show how effective the suit is at protecting us against the cold from space because it's only our own body generated heat that keeps us warm other than the electrical fingertips.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Wow. How cold? I mean, what's what's the temperature out there?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 If we're in the shade or nighttime, it's just a few degrees. I mean, space is a few degrees above absolute zero and the things we're touching will be down at minus 100 Celsius.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 But in the sunshine, metal panels can be as hot as plus 260 Celsius.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 So even when you're working in the sun, you know, you might have one hand, you know, on one side of a solar panel in the sun and the other in the shade.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 And your space suit is having to cope with this massive, massive thermal, thermal differentiation between between the two.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 So it's doing a remarkable job.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 That's like Canada, I believe. I'm led to inform.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 They send astronauts to Canada to live for a year, don't they, to prepare.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 That would be good training, I'm sure.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Does it feel, I mean, how odd does it feel when you step out of the airlock?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 It's brilliant. I mean, it does feel odd because you just suddenly feel the exposure and, you know, you're aware that the danger is kind of palpable in that respect, like, OK, this is it.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 I mean, the vacuum of space, just a suit and a thin visor, but you soon get comfortable and you get comfortable with the view as well.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 And, you know, you let go, you know, you're not going anywhere.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 So as long as you're tethered onto the space station.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 But sometimes the vertigo just catches you out unexpectedly.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 It happened to me once.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 I was coming back towards the airlock along this thin pole.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 It's like a shortcut.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 And so I was not surrounded by structure at all.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 And I was kind of like hanging onto this pole and I looked down and suddenly got this massive wave of vertigo seeing Western Australia down below my feet.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 What a stupid time to look down.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Oh, my God.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 You know, one thing as you're looking down, if you are taken in by the absolute beauty of what you're seeing.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 One thing you can't do in your space suit is go.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Yes. Yeah, whistling.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 Whistling space.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Well, it's no, I mean, it's really weird in that low pressure environment.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 Whistling is really, really hard.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 And your voice tends to kind of drop an octave, which for me is quite good because I've got a high voice anyway.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 But it'd be great for David Beckham.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 So yeah, it's one of those environments where, you know, you'd see in that low pressure just weird things happen.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 So no whistling is really hard.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Wow. I didn't know that about the voice.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 That's what I want to try that.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 That's I'm put off by the lack of whistling because my mum always said you can't be unhappy when you're whistling.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 But I quite like the idea of the voice going down an octave, kind of sexy and sultry.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 Sexy astronauts.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 That's the only version that we have.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 It's funny when you say it's about sexy astronauts, one of the things that came up, why I came up with the fact is from gravity

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 and Sandra Bullock, you know, coming in from her spacewalk and taking it off and there she is.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 All she's wearing is hot pants underneath her spacey.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 So that's why I thought I've got a, it's been a myth busting here.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 I can't believe that was your chief problem with the science of film gravity.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Oh, everything else, everything else is perfectly accurate.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 We fly around on fire extinguishers all the time.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 You see George Clooney's ghost when you're up there.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 Everyone sees George Clooney's ghost.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 When you're inside the ISS, the clothes that you're wearing, obviously quite different, more comfortable, hopefully.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 But when you have to take them off, is it the case that I think I was listening to the NASA podcast and they were saying that dead skin is a real problem.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 So when you're taking off your socks, particularly dead skin comes off a lot.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 And do you have to take your socks off next to a sort of suction vent or something?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 Right.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 It's gross.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Yes.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 There are some things about the human body you just don't want to really see.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 And we don't get to see on Earth how much we shed each day, really.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 It's kind of hidden from us.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 But up there, yeah, you take your socks off and in weightlessness, anything that's inside your socks will just come flying out.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 And your feet, because you're not walking on them, all of the hard and dead skin that's accumulated all of our lives.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 It's just after about a month or two, it's shedding off.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 So big, big, horrible flakes of skin coming off your feet.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 I mean, you have to do it next to the egg return grid because it's the cleanest way of doing it.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Just take your socks off.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Are they reusable for anything in the way that I know that urine is being turned back into water to drink?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 That's a good point.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 No, we haven't become that quite ingenious as to how to reuse dead skin.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 One thing I really found interesting was what you described.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 So you captured a cargo vehicle when you're up there, not what captured, you know, it was scheduled to come in.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 It's not like you were just doing space piracy or whatever.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 But the method by which you gauge how close it is, because you're using a robotic arm, aren't you, to hint to it at exactly the right moment.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 And obviously it's rolling, you're rolling, there's lots of pitch and you're.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 The method is so it's antiquated.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 It is. It's unbelievable.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 And, you know, when I was first told, this is how you do it, I couldn't quite believe it.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 I thought, hang on a second, you know, where's the laser rangefinder?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Where's the image tracker?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 You know, we are coming from a background flying all these sophisticated aircraft with these tracking systems and lock on systems and guidance systems.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 No, you've got two old hand controllers and what your crewmates can do is print off some sheets of paper with pictures of how big the cargo vehicle looks at different ranges.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 So when he sees it this big is loads, it's five meters, then four meters, then three meters.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 I thought they're having a joke, but that is that is how we do it.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 And you just have to drive in this robotic arm from the cupola window looking at some old screens and just hoping it all goes to plan.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 It's by far and above it's the highest pressure moment for any astronaut is capturing a cargo vehicle, more so than the space without a doubt.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 And if you miss it, is there a sort of second chance?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Is that it? They're stuck in space now forever?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 It depends how badly you screw up really.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 If you if you just miss it, you can have a second chance if you haven't knocked it.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 But if you knock it and it, you know, you can cause some damage or even cause it to go off tumbling into space, then that could be really bad.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 So, yeah, the pressure is definitely on there.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 So in the way that you train underwater for the spacewalk, do you also go to sort of amusement parks and play that claw game?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 We have to catch a soft toy.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 I've never won at that claw game.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 It's the most depressing thing in the world.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 Years of training, years of academy training wasted.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 My fact this week is that visitors to the Sarawak Cave in Borneo don't report feeling claustrophobic, they report feeling agriphobic.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 Riddle me that.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 What is going on?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Is it huge?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 It's big. It's the biggest cave chamber in the world.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 So this is inside a cave system called the Good Luck Cave, and it would fit and it took me a long time to do this calculation because it's a while since I worked out volumes.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 But it would fit roughly 10 Wembley stadiums inside it.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 I think based on Google Maps measuring of the Wembley Stadium, which is large, very tall, very wide, very long.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 It was discovered in 1981 and when the first people went in, they didn't know they were in a big cave at all.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 They thought they were in a little tunnel and so they were just feeling their way along the sides and they followed the wall for ages and it was sort of bending round.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 And when they'd almost come back, done full circle, they were like, "Hang on, is this just empty in the middle?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 Are we in a giant stadium?" And they walked through the middle of it and realised that they were.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 Wow, that must have been incredible. I can imagine that feeling of agriphobia actually get to the middle of that stadium and switch the lights off.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 I mean, you'd think you were just floating in space. It would just be incredible.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 Yeah, it sounds incredible.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 The other thing, having done some caving as well, the fear of getting lost because, of course, caving is all about following known features and finding your way back in the middle of that thing.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 How do you work out which way you're going to go?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 I wondered that. Yeah, just wandering around it forever because you kind of forget when you see pictures of caves that obviously very well photographed and you do forget that you are in pitch darkness basically all the time on you except for a tiny light in front of your face.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Yeah.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 But why is there no, why is no one's set up some sort of breadcrumbs system whereby you can follow, you know, luminous breadcrumbs or glow sticks?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 Hansel and Gretel.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 Yeah, what's going on?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 I'm sure there are directions, aren't there?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Maybe.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 Directions.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 You've got a compass. Do you take a compass there?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 Yeah, if the rocks aren't, you know, if there's not too much metal content, iron content in the rocks, I guess you could try a compass or just have a little bit of string.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Use the cave diver method.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Yes.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 We mentioned the Sondun cave in Vietnam ages ago as an example of another extremely big cave, but I didn't, I think we said that it has clouds that form in it.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 That's how tall it is, but I didn't know this.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 It's got a jungle in it.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 It's got proper sort of, you know, virgin jungle, 600 feet below the surface of the earth.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 And it's also this jungle I read is home to the only underground monkeys on the planet.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 Cool.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 The only monkeys in the world that live their lives underground, which I've really hope is true.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 Well, where have you read?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 I mean, I read it in a reliable source.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 Well, it's supposed to be professional researchers and sources, Andy.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 I hope it's true as well.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 You've just said it.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 Yeah.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 That is unbelievably cool.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 That is cool.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 I guess they've evolved to suit their habitat.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 So I wonder what, you know, how different they are to, you know, other monkeys in the region that are outside the cave.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 It feels like they're a really good backup for all life forms on earth.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 And then if we all, if we all go to the some accident nuclear or something, at least those monkeys will probably be fine.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 Yes.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Yes.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 But it's got a big gaping hole at the top, right?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 As in it's not underground monkeys.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 They're just subterranean.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 There has to be some light.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Yeah.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 For the trees to, for the jungle to survive.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Yeah.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 Nice.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 You do often get actually in these massive caves, birds, you get little swiftlets.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 So this is in the biggest cave by volume, which is actually in China.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 So the other one is the biggest cave by area.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 And the swiftlets are the birds out of which you make bird nest soup in China.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 And so that's why a lot of people go caving in there to collect that, although I think they've commercialized bird nest soup and they've just started farming them these days.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 But it sounds really sweet.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 I was reading about someone who went to sort of stay in that cave for a couple of months and said that you lie down on the ground and the swiftlets will just land on your

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 chest and let themselves be petted.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 Wow.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 That's really sweet.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 It is.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 That's great.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 And they make the nest out of saliva, don't they?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 It's all saliva birds nest soup, basically, I think.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 It's strands of the whole bird nest is this white, these white threads.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 Oh, I thought those twigs held together with saliva.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 I think it's pretty much all saliva glands with a little bit of paraphernalia to cushion it.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 You've never been tempted to try some, though.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 It's not the best.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 It's quite a high price to pay for something apparently tasteless.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 If you're trapped down there and hungry, I think I'd give it a go, definitely.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 You definitely would, actually.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 You're right.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Just let the birds land on you, build their nest on you, and then...

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 Feeding it.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Yeah.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 So frustrating for the bird.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 What's happened to it?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 I looked away for one second.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 Caves are quite important for training for things like space, actually, aren't they?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 And training for how humans are going to survive in isolation, I think.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 So quite a lot of people do this weird thing where they experiment on themselves by going deep into caves

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 and staying there for ages.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 And I think the king of that is this amazing guy called Michel Sif,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 who's this sort of geologist who's basically been bedding down deep in caves for over 50 years

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 for various long amounts of time.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 And the first time he did it, he was 1972, and he spent six months, 440 foot inside a Texas cave, in fact.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 So maybe just avoiding the heat.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 And they learned so many interesting things, but the weirdest thing is the sleep cycle

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 and how our sleep cycle changes.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 So he would fall asleep for sort of 30 hours and think he just had a short nap.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 Whoa.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 And so one day he had lasted 52 hours.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 On his 63rd day inside, as in the 63rd time he'd woken up, 77 days had passed above ground.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 So it seems like our days really lengthen when we're underground.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 But it sounds awful. I don't know why he kept doing it.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 He said he was so lonely he contemplated suicide.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 And this is the first time he's done it like seven times since.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 There's an awful story in his diary where he's just staying alone.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 He writes a diary every night.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 And when he first went down, he killed a bunch of mice who were infesting his little chamber.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 And then after a few weeks he realized he really wanted a friend.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 And he saw a mouse and he thought, oh my God, that's my friend.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 He's going to keep me company through these awful months.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 And he spread some jam on the floor and then put a little pee next to it to lure this mouse in.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 And he slammed a bowl down over it to catch it and he crushed the mouse.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 No.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 It just sounds like surely the worst moment of his life.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 What a shame.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 Because I imagine in his head, this was the Hollywood moment where a man underground

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 with a mouse for a best friend, you know, like, but then he ruined it.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 Totally ruined it.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 Yeah.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 There's actually a woman called Josie Law, who's the woman who spent the most time alone in a cave.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 And she did successfully befriend a white mouse.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 Oh, that's something.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Yeah, that's something.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 Yeah.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 I read that account of Seifra and his mouse.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 I think he said later on that he didn't remember it.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 Because obviously you forget time when it's all, you know, similar and monotonous.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Yeah.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 But he did keep a diary.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 So he wrote in the diary, I killed the mouse and it's.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 I'd love to know what he felt when it came out.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 Okay.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 With that kind of sensory overload of being deprived of all those senses for so long.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Yeah.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 Because I mean, when I came out after just seven days, it was as if somebody had turned contrast

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 up on the telly to full.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 The sky was this brilliant blue and you could smell the moss under the trees and everything

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 was just an overdrive.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 It only lasted for about 30 minutes.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 But it kind of made me realize that we get so used to our limited senses and other animals,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 you know, have these incredible senses that it would be wonderful.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 I'd love to be able to smell like a dog or a polar bear and just to explore their world

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 and, you know, or have the, you know, the eyesight of owls and be able to see what they see at

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 nighttime.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 So I think you've been underground.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 That was in a Sardinian, a cave complex in Sardinia.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 There's about 15 kilometers of unexplored cave.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 And that was fascinating, Anna, about the time because we were actually deprived of sleep

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 down there.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 That was part of the excite.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 They took our watches away.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 So we had no idea, no concept of time.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 And when you woken up after about two hours and told that we'd had eight hour sleep, so

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 now crack on with your next day's work, which we, Julie, did, feeling a little tired come

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 the third or fourth day thinking, why am I so exhausted?

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 And of course, of course, you're only getting two hours sleep a night without thinking you're

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 getting a good eight hours.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 And then you get told after you wake up on the seventh morning thinking, OK, I'm leaving

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 the cave today.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 No, no, no, no, no.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 You've got another three days to go.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 So that was not allowing us to get into our natural cycles.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 It's fascinating to think the body actually goes the other way in a cave and you actually

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 lengthen your days and lengthen the amount of time you sleep.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 Were you angry when you sort of woke up and they were like, punked you?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 You're only getting two hours sleep a night.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 Yeah, but that was the whole point.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 They were trying to make us angry through the whole exercise.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 It was all about trying to push you to, you know, so that there'd be conflict between you

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 as a team.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 And you had to be a substitute to learn how to deal with the pressure of being cold, wet,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 tired and hungry.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 And if they could instigate a little bit of conflict amongst you as a team, of course,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 then you're able to explore those psychological aspects as well.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 I mean, it was all really beneficial training for the space station.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 But I'm not sure I would voluntarily spend six months down the cave.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 I mean, that's an awful long time.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 Was there conflict?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 There was a dead rival somewhere deep within this cave.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 Someone who never made it.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 Is it like the experience of coming out where you describe this incredible sensory overload

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 and, you know, you can smell the moss and the sunlight has never been brighter.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 Is it like having been to the cinema in the daytime?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 Because for me, that's, I think, as close as I'll ever get in my life.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 I fell to my knees, I kissed the ear, all of it.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 You know, Brian Blessed says that when he came down from Mount Everest, there was so much

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 sensory overload for him that he could see the molecular makeup of flowers when he looked

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 at them.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 He could see the cells of his hand.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 Yeah, he said his eyes were so heightened in their clarity.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 Don't degrade the quality of truth you're getting from Tim here with your Brian Blessed bullshit.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 Go more back to Andy's side.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Is it like when you come out of IKEA after shopping for six hours?

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Keep it observational.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 There's a great word that I love, which is associated with caves, which is Berenschliff.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 And this is a word that means the smooth polished surfaces of a cave wall caused by the fur of

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 a passing cave bear.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 This is the story.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 It's believed that cave bears, they wallow in mud and they do that so they can loosen

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 parasites that are on their fur and the solids that are contained in the mud in connection

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 with the hair that they have as they pass wall, acts like a sandpaper.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 So after time and time and time again, it smooths the rock wall into this polished surface.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 And it's a surface that you can only get polished if done by the specific method of a bear doing

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 it.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 So yeah, Berenschliff.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 Wow.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 Thank you very much.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 And Brian, bless and tell you that.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Oh, that's so cool.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 That sounds like a German thing.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 It sounds like an obscure German gentleman, Berenschliff.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 Ropping up against a cave.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 There's a cave in Slovenia, which has a train inside it, which is so much fun.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 The postagna cave.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 And it was designed to replace the sedanches, which were the original means of getting around

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 the cave.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 They were for royals, obviously only, but when these caves were discovered, it was the mid-19th

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 century.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 And, you know, millions and millions of years have passed in the cave when they were unknown.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 And so, yeah, they then got sedanches.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 Then they got a train, which was hand pulled.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 So Victorian tourists would visit and just be pulled along by laborers.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 And then eventually, because it's so horizontal in the cave, they've built a little mini Disneyland

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 inside it.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 Oh, caving was a different experience, wasn't it?

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 To having read some of the quite hardcore experiences of cave as today, getting carried down in a

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 sedan chair did not feature anywhere.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 I'd be up for it if it did.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 It does sound quite dangerous.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 Andy Evis, I think, is sort of this absolute legend.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 He's the great spelunker of our age.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 And he was the first person to explore this good luck cave, actually.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 And he just such mad stuff happened.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Like at one point there was a huge flood and they got trapped deep inside a cave.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 And one of the people on their team had to do this extremely long free dive, which they call a self rescue.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Where, you know, you just have to swim down under the flood and swim and swim and hope that you get out.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 And I think a photographer split his thigh open and they had to trek overnight through the rainforest.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 When the doctor arrived to fix his leg, a tree fell through the roof of their camp just and landed just next to him.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 They all got fever from rat poison, I think.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 Was that a thing Tim, they warn you about? Apparently everyone's feet get eaten away by gross bacteria.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 Man, your feet have taken a beating, Tim.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 Between space and caves.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Yeah, that's why the skin falls off.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 There's nothing to do with the pedicure you get from space.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 It's the rat poison.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Yeah, we thankfully didn't come across any bears or rats on our caving expedition.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 In the wrong caves.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 Absolutely.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 You did have that, didn't you, where you went through somewhere on an early caving adventure.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 You went through a narrow tunnel and then you read the directions later on.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 This was back in the highly irresponsible days of my 20s when we were just...

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 We were actually rock climbing and abseiling a lot and kayaking at the weekends in Wales.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 And we saw a couple of people just pop out the side of the rock face and got speaking to them.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 They said, "This area is riddled with caves."

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 And so we thought, "That's it. Next weekend we'll do some caving then."

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 And literally kind of had a couple of maglites each and a Kit Kat.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 And on off we went into this cave complex with a rough sketch of what it was.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 And literally a photocopied couple of pages out the guidebook.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 And it wasn't until we were about two hours into the cave having gone through these very, very narrow presses

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 that Dave, my friend, read the second page of the guide and said,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 "If there was a noticeable flow of water through this thing called the pebble flow,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 you should abandon the cave immediately because it's prone to flooding.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 And it had been pouring with rain outside."

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 And the pebble crawl was about 45 minutes back from where we'd come

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 and the water had been up to our elbows as we went through this thing.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 So we suddenly realised we needed to get out of this thing in a hurry

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 and by the time we got back to the pebble crawl, we had about three inches of where we could breathe

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 along this 20-foot kind of tunnel.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 So we were going through there with our chins tilted upwards

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 and we were so close to being trapped down there.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Were you still sort of holding the paper of the photocopy bits of the guidebook

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 just above the water level?

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 We'd given up on it.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 I don't think we ever got that bit of paper back again.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 But we realised quite how irresponsible we'd been after that

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 and we treated that environment with a bit more care and respect

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 and came back the following weekend a bit better prepared.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 But that was a good lesson.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 That was a good lesson in that.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 It's reading page two of the instructions. That seems to be a big thing.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 It is kind of like when you get to the end of cooking something

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 and it says, "Serve with the pre-prepared grilled vegetables from page 72."

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 Yeah, or leave to set in the fridge for 48 hours.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 We'll guess we're arriving in 10 minutes.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Basically, there's nothing that exciting that you can tell us, Tim,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 that we can't compare it to something much more boring.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 OK, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 My fact is that Chicago has an alcoholic spirit which tastes so bad

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 that its own founder used to boast that only one in 49 men liked it.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Who was the one?

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 So this is a thing called Jepsen's Millort,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 a founder by a man called Carl Jepsen.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 And it's a kind of spiced liqueur which is flavoured with wormwood.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 And yeah, mostly known in Chicago,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 but it's drunk in a few other places.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 But I've tried it and it is really, really an acquired taste.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 And the back of the bottle had this label which said,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 "Most first-time drinkers of Jepsen Millort reject our liquor."

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 During almost 60 years of American distribution,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 we found only one out of 49 men would drink it.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 It is rugged and unrelenting, even brutal to the palate.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 The whole label is just trying to say, "You're not going to like this."

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Wow, I'm amazed that you've tried it, Andy.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 You're a man who has an extra squeeze of lime in his soda water on a wild night out.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 I've actually tried it as well.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 I tried it on the last night of our US tour for fish when we were in Washington DC.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 I couldn't remember if we both had it on the same night.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 It was the worst thing.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 You tried it together with each other.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 This is how pungent and painful it was.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 I don't remember Andy being there when I tried it.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 He clearly doesn't remember being there.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 It's horrific.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 It's utterly disgusting.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 I am one of the 48, and I agree with Tim.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 I want to know who this one guy is.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Actually, I know who this one guy is.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 One guy that we know who drinks it is a comedian who's been on our show, John Hodgman,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 who has it as his preferred drink.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 Really, because I read a quote from John saying it tastes like pencil shavings and heartbreaks.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 That is a bizarre preference for him to have.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 But he just loves that.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 It's not such a wonderful description.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 It's like pencil shavings and heartbreaks.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 How would you describe it?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 I would just say it's overwhelmingly better.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 But they've asked more eloquent people than me.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 So they don't have many employees.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 It's quite a small firm, Jepsen's Mallort.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 But in the past, they've asked the public for slogans.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 And the slogans that have come back have been things like,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 "Mallort, what soap, what is its mouth out with?"

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 "Mallort, kick your mouth in the balls."

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 And my favourite, "Mallort, these pants aren't going to shit themselves."

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 Stunning. We've got to employ that person for our PR.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 So it's got Wyrmwood in it, right?

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 Similar to Absence.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 And which has a bad reputation, Wyrmwood.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 And maybe unjustifiably.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 Do you remember when we were all younger and everyone claimed

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 that Absence was illegal, was the first claim.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 And the second claim was that the Wyrmwood in it,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 that's now illegal, makes you hallucinate and sends you mad.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 Did everyone have something for these kids?

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 Dimly, yeah.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 But none of it's true?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 Not true.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 No, although it was banned for years,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 because people thought it was true.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 So it was Absence was what, you know,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 all your van goffs and all your crazy artists

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 and writers of the 19th century were drinking,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 especially in France.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 And it was thought to be responsible for the degeneration

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 of French society, I think.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 And it was, it was banned in France.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 And the justification was that Wyrmwood sends you mad

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 and gives you hallucinations.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 And it was only in the 1970s that we showed that

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 it's in such tiny amounts that it can't do you any harm in it.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 And it's just the fact that Absence is faking strong

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 and full of alcohol.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 But the US didn't lift the ban until 2007.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 Wow.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 Do you know what the Russian for Wyrmwood is?

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 It's Chernobyl.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 What?

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 Really?

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 So Chernobyl was named after the Wyrmwood fields.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 The town and the nuclear plant were named

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 after the Wyrmwood fields around it.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 That is the Russian word for Wyrmwood.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 Yeah.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 Oh, so if you were to do this podcast in Russia

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 and say Wyrmwood doesn't do you any harm,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 then that would not be true.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 And you'd have to be very careful with the translation.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 Tim, you were a cocktail mixer once, right?

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 A long time ago, I wish I'd come across Malore then

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 because I think it would have been hilarious

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 to have served that to the customers.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 What's the word?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 What's Tom Cruise in Thompson?

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 A mixologist.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 Well, you know, they call that flair tending.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 Flair tending.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 Flair tending.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 Yes.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 Yeah, it was an ordinary pub.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 It was called the Nagshead in Jesusus.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 It was an ordinary pub.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 But come Thursday through Saturday, it was just heaving.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 It was a great sort of young person's place to go and drink.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 And we turned it into a cocktail bar for those nights.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 And Olivier Barbadette was at the French head barman.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 And it was all, you know, we're proper there.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 Black tie, waist, black waistcoats kind of thing.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 So quite a sort of French influence to it.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 And it was all flair tending.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 And we would be spinning bottles.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 We'd be throwing glasses, catching ice cubes down there.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 I was just brilliant.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 So much fun.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 We'd practice for hours outside with empty bottles,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 smashing them all over the place and having to sweep up

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 all the debris before opening hours.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 And then Ben Off would go.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 It was a huge amount of fun.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 Did it ever come in handy?

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 Just did that training ever sort of later on the ISS?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 Was there a moment where--

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 I'm trying to think aware.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 I'd love to say yes, but I honestly can't think.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 But no, in terms of coming in useful,

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 it's got absolutely no use whatsoever.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 I guess if you throw a bottle of water over your head on the ISS,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 it just keeps going in the opposite direction.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Exactly.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 Hey, do you know who the first ever flair tender was?

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 As far as we know, a sort of documented case of it.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Is it a famous person who we will have heard of?

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 Absolutely not.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 No.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 Right, OK.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 This will be a tougher guess.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 All right.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 So start the alphabet A, Aaron.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 Let's call it Aaron.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 No, head down towards J, and you'll be more there.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 Jerry, the Professor Thomas.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 And he was an American bartender,

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 and he wrote what was the first ever book of fancy drinks, basically.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 It was called The Bartender's Guide,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 a complete cyclopedia of plain and fancy drinks.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 And he used to go around to different bars all over America.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 And he was the first to do tricks with spinning of the metal canisters

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 that you would mix a drink in,

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 and he would set them alight and he would transfer the flame into another glass.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 But yeah, so we know who kind of the first person was.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 And one of the things that he put into his cocktail book was the Tom Collins,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 which I didn't realize was there's this hoax in America called the Tom Collins hoax.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 Have you guys heard of that?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 It used to be a game where you used to say in a bar,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 if the four of us were in the bar, I'd say, "Andy,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 have you heard that guy, Tom Collins, who's been talking smack about you?"

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 And you'd say like, "What?"

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 Tom Collins said this thing.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 And the idea was it was a hoax where you convinced someone

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 that Tom Collins was talking about you and spreading rumors, making you furious.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 And that's what pranks used to be back in the day.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 So it's like stripy paint, isn't it?

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 Sending someone off a stripy paint is kind of like that.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 Is that a thing?

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 Yeah, because it should be obvious.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 No, it's not a thing, Dan.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 Dan's getting up to get some.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 Hang on. You get stripy toothpaste.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 Why don't we get stripy paint?

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 Do you know that it's actually an unarmed trouble argument?

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 That's a really, really good point.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 He's outwitting them.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 What do you guys think is the most popular spirit,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 or the most commonly drunk spirit on Earth, or in the universe?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 I love that we have to specify "on" or "on" tips on the podcast.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 Yeah, we do.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 I know which one it is on Earth.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 On Earth, I don't know, gin is fairly popular.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 I'll say whiskey.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 Lots of big whiskey fans out there.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 Nice. I mean, you're not going to get it.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 Don't think. I'll tell them I get it.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 It's Baizhou, which is a Chinese liquor,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 which basically is not drunk outside of China,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 but is the most commonly drunk spirit in the world.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 Baizhou, are you saying?

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 Baizhou is an alcohol, and Baibing white, the word.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 Yes, but it's a spirit.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 But it's a spirit, yeah.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 Yeah, it's distilled. Have you tried it?

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 I think I have, yeah.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 It sounds familiar enough that I feel like I must have.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 It sounds, I texted my friend yesterday who lives in China

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 and says it resembles paint stripper, but it's very popular.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 But it sells more than whiskey, vodka and rum combined worldwide.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 And it sounds great. There's a museum in China.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 How do you pronounce it, Dan?

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 China.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 Fuck you.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 Baizhou.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 Baizhou.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 There's a Baizhou Museum in China,

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 which shows a reenactment video of when it was,

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 when it went global, which I think it's question,

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 question mark over whether it's gone global.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 But apparently it went to the World Fair in San Francisco in 1915,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 and all the Americans were sneering at it,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 and this weird sort of earthenware jar filled with this Chinese drink.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 And it made the Chinese delegates so nervous

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 it was smashed all over the floor.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 And then the scent of it was so seduced everyone

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 that it won the prize that year,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 and has gone down in history as everyone's favorite spirit.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 Of course.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 Yeah, we've all got our bottles right here, haven't we?

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 Yeah.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 Have you heard of the six o'clock swell?

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 This is a thing. Heard of it? No?

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 No.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 So this was a thing that happened in Australia, okay.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 And I think Australians are sort of a kind of big drinking country.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 You know, they like their drink.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 There was a rule in place, a law in Australia and New Zealand,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 that you had to finish your drinks.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 Last orders was 6 p.m. pretty much every day, as far as I could tell.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 And this lasted from 1960, when there were restrictions because of the war,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 until 1967.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 All license establishments had to stop serving at 6 p.m. incredibly early.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 So the six o'clock swell was the final hour of legal drinking in Australia,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 between 5 and 6 p.m.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 Everyone would leave their work and immediately go to the bar

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 and start getting drinks in hand over fist,

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 drinking as much as they could until 6 p.m.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 And then bang, the bell rang and that was the cut off.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 Yeah. And it was mayhem.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 What year was that?

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 It ended in different regions of different years in Australia,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 but the final one to scrap it, scrapped it in 1967.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 Yeah. It's quite late.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 Your parents might remember it then.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 Well, actually, so my parents would have been,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 my dad would have been 10 roughly at that time.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 So he remembers it very well.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 But no, by weirdly, the last time I was in Australia,

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 I was talking to my grandfather, who was there in that period.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 He's Austrian, but he'd moved over at that point.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 And he was telling me exactly about this thing.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 And the problem was is everyone after 6 p.m. had to drive home

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 and they all did it drunk as hell.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 And because you'd had to drink so quick that you felt really ill.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 And he said many, many days would he stop at a traffic light.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 It was just people, including him,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 rolling down their window,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 vomiting out the window at a traffic light

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 and then continuing on to drive home.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 So yeah, it was definitely, definitely a thing.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 We are going to have to move on in a sec.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 I've just got one more drink.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 Yeah.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 Have you heard of whiz key?

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 No.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 Okay.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 This is a drink that was invented by a British entrepreneur in 2010.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 He's called James Gilpin.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 And whiz key is whiskey made using the sugar rich urine

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 of diabetes patients.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 So if you have diabetes,

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 you have a lot of sugar in your urine sometimes.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 And Gilpin has diabetes himself,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 but he contacted various elderly volunteers,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 including his own grandmother,

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 and extracted the sugar molecules from the urine,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 added them to the mash stock to accelerate the fermentation.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 He didn't sell it.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 He said this was illegal.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 But he said he was trying to make, you know,

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 be thought provoking about how we use the resources we have.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 And actually, as obviously on the ISS,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 everything is recycled to become clean drinking water.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 I thought it's not as silly an idea,

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 but maybe it might be as well.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 Yeah.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 We certainly don't go making whiskey up there,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 but you are reminded every day, of course,

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 that you're drinking your crewmates urine

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 that's been recycled in about 24 hours.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 It's a fast turnaround as well.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 It's a fast turnaround.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 Does your mind ever play with you, Tim,

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 where you think you can taste something that's not there?

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Is this definitely filtered?

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 I just never drank pure water.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 I always mixed it with something.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 It was either a tea, cup of tea,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 or it was a fruit juice or something,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 because to drink the pure water

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 was a little bit too close to the bone.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 This is why you didn't need to go to the lawn

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 your entire space because you were refusing to drink

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 for your six months in a day.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 You need more diabetics up there.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 Yeah, clearly.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 Get diabetics to sweeten the urine.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 Don't even need to put sugar in the tea.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 and that is my fact.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 My fact this week is that Land Rover once released a manual,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 which was edible, so if you got lost in the desert,

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 you could eat it to survive.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 This was 2012.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 They published this.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 They published in Dubai.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 It's called the Land Rover's Edible Survival Guide,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 and the idea was if you got lost out in the desert,

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 this manual could tell you things like how to build a shelter,

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 how you could signal for help,

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 but then it became more practical as well.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 The metal wiring on the inside could be removed,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 and you could use it as a cooking skewer.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 It had reflective packaging around it as well,

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 so that you could use that to make signals

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 so that people could see you.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 But the greatest thing of all is that on the front,

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 it says, "In case of emergency, eat this book."

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 And if you did eat it, according to the people who made it,

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 the ink and paper, which were both edible,

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 had the nutritional value of a cheeseburger.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 So you were actually getting a good meal out of it, yeah.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 Right. So you need to have read it all first.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 Yeah, you've got to be so careful.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 You think which bits you're not going to need.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 You don't need to know about the air conditioning system.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 That can go. That's a snack.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 Brilliant.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 But such a clever idea.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 I love survival guides,

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 and an edible one is the most practical of them all.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 It is.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 If you're desperate.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 It is.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 If only you'd had that inside your cave, Tim.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 You could have lasted hours more in there.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 Absolutely.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 I know.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 In the army, we used to get given these survival kits as well.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 And they had tallow candles.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 So it's edible candle wax.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 And it was a similar thing.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 But if push came to shove and you were starving

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 and you decided that warmth and light and heat wasn't essential,

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 you could just start munching your way through this tallow candle instead.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 I tried some, and it was just disgusting.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
 I mean, you would just chew on this candle for ages,

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 and it wouldn't.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 I mean, no matter how much saliva you could generate,

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 it wouldn't go into a nice, moist part.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 It was just horrible.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 Wow.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 Is it just kind of fat tallow?

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 It is, isn't it?

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 Is it animal fat?

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 Yeah, I think it is.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 Yes, yeah.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
 But they did...

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 What was the wick made of in the candle?

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 Was that licorice or something?

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
 So you could...

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 No, I think that was the one that you weren't supposed to eat.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 It's got to be practical as well.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 Yeah, you've got to light it.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 Also, apparently, sometimes it's a bad idea to eat

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 if you're lost in the desert,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 because the process of digesting food actually uses up a lot of water.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 So if you're really lost,

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 the idea is that maybe you should limit yourself to drinking.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 And also, I didn't realise that.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 One page a day.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 A page a day.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 A line of text every few hours.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 But also, you shouldn't drink in small sips,

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 which I think is quite useful,

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 because if I were stranded in the desert,

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 I think I would be really conservative

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 and I only have a few sips of water at a time.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 But apparently, that means that your body doesn't...

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 It doesn't launch the body's process

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 that causes it to store the water.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 So it just loses it straight away.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 So the recommendation is that if you're lost in the desert,

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 you drink water maybe three to four times a day in a big batch,

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 and that's the way that it'll store it

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 and then, you know, actually be useful.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 Wow.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 Yeah.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 Didn't know that.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 That's very useful.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000
 They didn't teach us that during survival training.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 There you go.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 There you go, guys.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 We all could have died.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 Saved a lot of lives today.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 Slightly less useful survival tip, possibly,

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 is that you know how...

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 So this fact is about something that's normally non-edible,

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 but that turns out to be edible.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 Here's a fact about something edible

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 that you can use for non-edible purposes,

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
 which is that you can use Doritos to build a fire.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 What?

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
 Because they're so covered in the sort of cheesy, flammable dust

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 that they go up quite easily.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 It's short-term fire.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
 It's fire lighters, rather than...

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 You wouldn't have an entire fire without a Doritos.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 It's kindling, exactly.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 Could you clarify that?

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 Because we're going to get very angry emails from Dubai

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 when my Dorito fire went out in two seconds.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
 I mean, a lot of things can set on fire, can't they?

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000
 Yeah, true.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 But I thought for a second,

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 maybe you could start a fire with Doritos

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 by sort of rubbing one against the other.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 So that is genuinely good that you clarify.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 Sometimes if you open a packet of Doritos,

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 have you noticed that there's nothing but ash

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 in the bottom of it?

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000
 Do you guys know the US military's Universal Edibility Test?

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 I don't know if the British military has an equivalent, but...

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 No.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 Well, this...

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 Did they ever teach you, Tim,

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 like if you're stranded anywhere,

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
 how to identify stuff that's poisonous or not?

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 Well, they told us, you know,

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 put a bit on your lip for 10 minutes,

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 and then if your lip's not tingling and numb,

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
 then go under the tongue for 20 minutes,

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 and you do this incremental process.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 And eventually, there's a small quantity,

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 you get stomach ache, and eventually you can work out

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 whether your body can tolerate it or not.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 You bang on.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 They've nicked it off the brits.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 Yeah.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 So you do get taught that.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 It's a very long process, isn't it?

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 If you're starving.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 It's very long, yeah.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 Especially the bit that's, like,

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 swallow a tiny bit, wait for eight hours.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 Eat a page of your manual in between.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000
 I think the Italian army is the only modern one

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 which gives out alcohol in its standard military rations

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 to its troops.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
 The Guardian ran a huge piece about, you know,

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000
 all sorts of different countries,

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 and the sometimes very stereotypical things they have.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 So the French army, they get dear pâté,

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 cassoulet with duck confit,

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 small caramel pudding, mini baguette.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 They go super French.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 But the Italian army, I think,

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 there's the only one out of the ones they tried,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 which gives you a shot of alcohol, 40%,

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 just to keep your spirits up, I guess.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 Fantastic.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 I know that the French rations,

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
 they used to give out a small,

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 one of those kind of airline bottles of red wine.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 They probably stopped doing that now.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000
 But that just puts in comparison to British, you know,

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 where we get biscuits A-B.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 I have no idea what the A-B stands for.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 But the rations are just dreadful,

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
 designed to bung you up,

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 to stop you having the need to go to the loo

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 so frequently when you're on exercise

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 or digging trenches or things like that.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000
 Did you get mini-tobasco with your ration packs?

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 The US, yes.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
 Yeah, the US ration packs there,

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
 MREs, meals ready to eat.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 And they've got these brilliant chemical heaters.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 So, you know, the British rations,

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 we're still on lighting your solid fuel tablets

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 and you have a little stove to warm up the water.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000
 But no, America, you just rub the chemicals together,

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 break the packages and heats up chemically.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
 And it gets really, really hot.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 So, it's a fantastic way of having a meal ready to go.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 And they give you a little tabasco sachet in there,

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 or a small bottle of tabasco.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000
 That's so sweet.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 What they're not telling you is

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
 they're all told to keep a Dorito in their back pocket.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 Yeah.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 That's the key.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 My favourite survival meal that I learned about

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 was one that Shackleton had,

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 which I'd never read about on his Antarctic expedition,

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 the endurance expedition.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 His crew at one point,

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
 and this was, like, well into it when they were like,

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 "We're going to die now. We are stranded and lost."

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
 They were attacked by a leopard seal,

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 which very occasionally do attack humans.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 And, in fact, I think did kill someone a while back.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 So, they were attacked by a leopard seal,

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 and one of the crew managed to shoot it.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 Not only that, when they split it open,

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000
 its stomach was absolutely packed

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 with completely undigested fish.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000
 Oh, wow.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 So, they just got a soup case of fish.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 It's like a pinata.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 It's like a pinata.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000
 Stinking pinata.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 I found there's a classic survival guide book,

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 which is the SAS Survival Guide,

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 and it was written in 1987 by a guy called John Lofty Wiseman.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 And this has sold millions and millions of copies,

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 and he's quite an amazing character,

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 generally, to read into his story.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 He's the guy who helped set up the SAS counter-terrorist team,

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 and they were the ones that went into the Iranian embassy

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 when that big incident happened.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000
 So, he was part of the people that set that up.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 And he wrote this book, which is just packed

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 with very good, useful advice,

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 but also strays into territories where you think,

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 "When is this ever going to be a part of my life?"

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 For example, How to Kill an Octopus is a section.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 And he gives you three options of how to kill the octopus,

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 and a couple of them are quite normal,

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 sort of using a knife stab it between the eyes

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 or bang it against the rock.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000
 But one of the options is to thrust your hand

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 inside of the octopus into its flesh hood

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 and pull by its innards and flip it inside out,

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 like you would like a washing glove, you know,

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 like a marigold, I read in the article,

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 being pulled the other way out.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 That's one of his sort of basic options for you to kill an octopus.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 So, and then it has, you know,

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 lots of like basic stuff about how to lure animals

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 and pray in and get water and so on.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 Yeah, pretty spectacular.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 He must have been absolutely terrifying at children's parties,

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 turning up with his octopus glove puppet.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000
 It's amazing you said that.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 I've actually got that book on my bookshelf,

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 because I think I was about 13 or 14,

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 and it was given as a present, and I loved it.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 I absolutely loved it.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 The SAS survived.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 But you're absolutely right, and I remember as well,

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 and I haven't read this, you know, for 30 plus years,

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 but there was a bit in there that said about how to stop a car.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 If you're going down a hill, the brakes fail,

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 and the handbrake fails, you can use a wall

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000
 and just scrape the car along the side of the wall to slow you down.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 And I was thinking, when am I ever going to need it?

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 But it's something I remembered all of my life,

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 and I'm 48, and I haven't yet been going down a hill

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 and all the brakes have failed.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 But I'm waiting for that moment when I can scrape my car

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 along the wall, and thank you, Lofty.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
 Thank you for saving the day.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 That's so good. Fingers crossed.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 You're going to trust a guy whose name is Lofty Wiseman, aren't you?

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
 I'll do anything he tells me.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 That's very good.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 We should probably wrap up in a sec, guys.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 Sure.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 This is slightly off the topic of survival,

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 but it's just one more thing about food and sort of food for survival

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 and food preservation.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000
 So the first ever tin cans of food,

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 they were invented in the early 19th century,

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 and get this, every single one of them had spent a month

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 at a temperature of at least 90 degrees Celsius

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
 before being sold a solid month at 90 degrees.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
 That's going to be overcooked.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 I think they would have been quite overcooked.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
 Yeah, I don't think there were delicacies inside.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000
 They were made by a man called Brian Donkin,

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 who was a Northumbrian engineer,

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.000
 and that was the quality control for it to spend a month

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.000
 at about 190 to 100 degrees Celsius.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 Really?

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 I just find that amazing.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 Just to cook everything out of it that could do you any harm.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 Yeah, the canning process.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 I learned a bit about that when we were looking at the food

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 for going up into space,

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 and we ran it as a competition to kind of design a meal for the day

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 with all the right nutrients and minerals and vitamins.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
 And then the winners of the competition got to cook it

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
 with Heston Blumenthal,

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 and he didn't want to tin the food,

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
 because it's just, from a chef's point of view,

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 it just destroys it, this whole canning process.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 Like you say, you have to have it at these really, really high temperatures,

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 but we ended up having to put a lot of it into cans anyway.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 He went through 25 different types of bread

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 before he found the ideal bread

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
 that could make a bacon sandwich,

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 and you could pop the tin after 18 months,

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 and it would still be fresh, buttery, nice and warm,

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 and taste like a good bacon sandwich.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 But the bacon looked disgusting,

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000
 because everything in the whole canning process

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 is just cooked to oblivion

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000
 to enable it to last so long.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 Of course, the other one is the irradiation

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 from the foil pouches that we have,

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000
 and that all gets put through this process

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
 for, again, for long-term preservation,

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 so it doesn't really matter what you do.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000
 None of the food is going to come out of a packet

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 or a tin tasting particularly good.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 Heston Tabasco.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000
 Heston Blumenthal would not survive long on the ISS.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.000
 I sense if he's refusing to touch anything,

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000
 it has to be tinned.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
 And is it true, Tim,

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 that Doritos are not actually allowed on the ISS

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000
 because it's effectively a small bomb?

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 It's a fire hazard.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
 Yeah.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000
 Well, they were, but after listening to this podcast,

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
 they're probably going to get removed from the list.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000
 We'll have a lot of angry astronauts now

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000
 who won't be able to have their Doritos in space.

 from being in the military through to flying test pilot helicopters

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000
 and planes, getting into space, getting back down again.

 Andy's just finished it, and you loved it, Andy.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
