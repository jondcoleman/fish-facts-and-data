WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
 Hi everyone, welcome to a brand new piece of bonus material. This is the Nosey Singles

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.960
 of Fish Breakfast Club. Now we are currently on tour in Australia and New Zealand and one

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.480
 bit of time when we spend a lot of time together is over breakfast where we shoot the breeze

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.360
 about things that we've discovered recently about how the shows are going and quite often

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.300
 about the breakfast itself. So we thought what better way to let you know what it's

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.160
 like to be on tour with Nosey Singles of Fish as to record those conversations and put them

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.920
 out here. Now you will notice that it's quite an experimental format at the moment. In fact

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.360
 I'm not really sure exactly who will be the co-host and maybe you could let us know who

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:49.000
 you think sold the breakfast club best out of our two co-hosts who are in this episode.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.200
 We'll probably do this one and we might do another one a little bit down the line with

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.400
 two new people but anyway, really hope you enjoy it and I should really not say any more

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.760
 apart from on with the bonus material.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:23.360
 We're recording. Well, welcome to Andy and James' Breakfast Club. Yeah, welcome everybody.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.320
 This is really exciting. This is something a first in Fish History. Well it's actually

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.720
 a first because I'm up for breakfast at the same time as you. Yeah, that's true. For

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.760
 just a little bit of behind the curtain wizardry. I think let's sit behind the curtain wizardry

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.040
 because that's wizardoise. He is behind the curtain. Yeah, that's fine. That works. I'm

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.000
 normally the first to have breakfast at James. Often you don't have breakfast at all. I'm

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.300
 not really a breakfast kind of person. No. I'm at one slice of cold burnt toast every

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.960
 day with cholesterol spread. I'm currently on my fourth course and so you know this is

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.120
 a real cultural meeting here. Well actually because we're in Australia at the moment and

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.520
 the time difference in the jet lag and all that stuff, I'm currently waking up at 7 a.m.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.600
 So here we are. We've been thrown together by fate. Dan and Anna, no sign of them. This

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.520
 is the worst Robin Cup that's ever happened. You could say cold sliced meat, cute. Oh yeah,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.240
 maybe. Let's work on it. There's a range of breakfast hams over there which I haven't

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.260
 really been engaged with at all. Well you're vegetarian. I'm vegetarian. But if you're

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.760
 listening to this and you can think of what the name of James and Andy's Robin Cup would

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.520
 be, where we meet over breakfast in a star crossed way and do right in and what is that.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.240
 Yeah, do absolutely. Yeah. But what we're going to do I think is we're going to review your

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.480
 breakfast, review our breakfasts in all the different places. Are we going to say the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.120
 name of the hotel or not? It depends. I mean it's so nice here but it's been great.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.360
 Okay. And also we're leaving so there's no risk of fans turning up at the door. That's

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.280
 true. Well in that case we're at the Crown Plaza in Adelaide and I should just say that

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.040
 we're both outmen of the people so we wouldn't book this ourselves. We'd be in some hovels

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.680
 somewhere but the entire company put us up in these nice hotels. I think that's established

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.400
 our proletariat credentials very nicely. We're currently sat by the window and this

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.640
 is the tallest building in Adelaide actually. I see it. Yeah. We're halfway up there. Yeah.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.640
 But there's plenty more to go above us. Yeah. So we've got a really nice view here overlooking

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.880
 the hills. This is a very nice city. My first time here. I think yours too. Yeah, for sure.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.360
 What did you do yesterday? I went to the botanical gardens. Oh yeah. And that was very nice. They

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.160
 do botanical gardens while the Australians don't they? Well I'm having this display at

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.240
 the moment at the botanical gardens here which is all these amazing glass sculptures. At night

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.480
 they light up and you walk around them and it's an amazing like a winter wonderland but

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.080
 it's that's cool. It's summer here. But I didn't know when I first arrived I didn't really

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.600
 pay attention to the sign saying we have glass sculptures everywhere and the plants are already

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:16.040
 pretty weird so I was just slowly jogging around going these plants are amazing. They're

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.800
 amazing. And they're all made of glass so it turns out it's the reason because they're

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.400
 everything that much weirder than the sound of Australian plants to me. I think that's

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.840
 one thing that you anyone who hasn't been to Australia which might be some of our listeners

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.440
 that's the first thing that strikes you is the blower and fauna is just so different

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.880
 isn't it? I got buzzed by a magpie, a hostile magpie which we've talked about on the show

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.800
 and has never happened to me. Yeah. Because British magpies are sensible tame guys. There

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.920
 are actual signs around here saying beware of the magpies aren't there? I didn't see

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.920
 the signs which is probably why I just and I took a crock I was doing a shortcut across

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.640
 a bit of grass and it kept on flying down and flying very near to my I didn't make contact

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.560
 but I felt I felt buzzed. I felt intimidated. Well I think to start off with they don't make

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.840
 contact today but just warning you you're in their patch. Yeah. So I learned I learned

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.720
 that the hard way. What else is? Yeah. So that's nice. Did you learn anything while you were

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.760
 down there? No. No facts. Well I was jogging so you know at the speed I go. Oh yeah. I barely

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:19.000
 like buildings move far so fast. Everything's blur, isn't it? Yeah. So I went to the Museum

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.360
 of South Australia what can allegedly pace around it rather than running around it as

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.920
 you might do and I learned something. Probably going at the same speed actually. Here's an

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.080
 interesting thing. Yeah. Did you know boomerangs? You could kill fish with them. They have fish

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.640
 killing boomerangs in this museum. Throw them into the water. Yeah. Yeah. They're heavier

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.560
 and they're really sort of water dynamic, not aerodynamic. They kind of cut through

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.440
 the water and people would use them. It was when it was like a low tide and stuff so they're

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.720
 not that deep but then you kind of skim your boomerang along the water and as it cut through

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.920
 the water it would kill the animals to be able to eat them. Isn't that amazing? I know

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.800
 like you say you are vegetarians so you don't want to kill them but in those days you know

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.800
 I'll kill fish. It was less trunky. I won't eat them. I won't eat them afterwards. So that

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.600
 was pretty cool. And they had so many boomerangs here. It's like that largest number of Aboriginal

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.520
 artifacts in any museum anywhere in the world. And yeah, there must be 500 boomerangs. If

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.200
 there was two, there was 500. And there were definitely two. There were at least two. What

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.800
 are we going? There must have been 500. So let's get onto the main important thing at

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.040
 hand. Yeah. You're currently on your which course of breakfast? This is four. This is

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:42.480
 four and actually your fourth course is actually quite a few. It's almost like a smorgasbord

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.200
 of different things. It's mixed carbs. Mixed carbs, right? We started with the Bertram

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.640
 Muesli which was fantastic. I've heard a lot of people say, think about Australia as it's

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:59.360
 the produce. The produce is so good. Oh yeah. And it's actually three. Protein is unbelievable.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.840
 Is that right? The raisins are the size of small dogs. They're so massive. In this Muesli

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.880
 I started a raisin. I was still eating it five or six minutes later. What's going on

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.880
 with the threads? They're huge. That is interesting. They're really big. Isn't that whole point

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.840
 of raisins that you remove all the water and that's how they get tasty? Oh my god. Yeah,

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.480
 you're right. I would have thought like the best raisins would be really dense like a

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.680
 neutron star. No, they aren't. But these raisins were bigger than British grapes. Oh my god.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.320
 So how big must these grapes have been? I have no idea. They must have grapes the size

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.480
 of a watermelon. It's amazing. So the Muesli, very good. I came with this sort of pruny

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:45.440
 mix on top. That's disgusting. I just eat a star anise. I do. It has a lot of star anise

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.440
 and cloves mixed in. Oh that's good. So it's going to taste quite Christmassy or watermelon.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.720
 It did actually. There's quite a lot of jeopardy. Am I going to eat a whole star anise? Yeah,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:01.040
 I'm stuck in my throat. My wife baked some pumpkin pie this Halloween and she's a very

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:07.020
 good cook, my wife, but she put whole cloves in it and then did remove them or anything.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:13.800
 So in your first bite, you chopped on a clove. You literally couldn't taste anything else.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.920
 For the next couple of days, actually, all it was was cloves in your mouth. Never tried

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:26.240
 biting a whole clove. I wouldn't recommend it. It's not good. But no cloves in this breakfast.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.320
 So you had your Muesli and then what was your next part? Course two is just patty planting

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.520
 yoghurt. Oh yeah. A large part of mixed berry yoghurt. Very nice. From South Australia, I

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:43.280
 think. Well the thing about South Australia is the prod is just so good. Part of the proceeds

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.240
 for this yoghurt go to benefit little heroes, which looks like a charity. That's nice. That's

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.360
 why I baked it. Is it for the charity? I do. I do. I do. I don't like to talk about the

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:59.940
 yoghurt side. The yoghurt I eat. But I do eat a lot of yoghurt. Yeah. When they have

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.360
 those telephones on television, you're just saying they're going to be eating a load of

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.440
 yoghurt at you. So this is the little heroes. They're always saying, do you want to do something

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.240
 a bit more creative with yoghurt this year? Do you want to have a bath in the yoghurt?

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.560
 Or do you want to be, like, gangled by yoghurt? I said, no, no, no, thank you. I'll just keep

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.480
 on wanting to do my way with this large pile of yoghurt. Yeah. Very good. But it was good.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.520
 But I don't want to talk about course two too much because it was just, you know, it's

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:28.000
 pretty package yoghurt. It was fine. It's great. But course three, the cookie. Oh, yeah.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.120
 And when you say cookie, you don't mean a biscuit. No, actually, I forgot the cookie

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:36.760
 was the word. Yeah. You called me in the morning before my vocab was warmed up. So it wasn't

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.160
 a cookie at all. It was a cookie for breakfast. Yes. And that was really good because they've

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.320
 got, obviously, they've got the cherries here. The scramblies are good. The scramblies, yeah.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:51.040
 The main index. Beanies. Beanies, great. I can see there is a remaining mushroom left

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.280
 on the plate that you didn't eat. And I have to say, everyone will have their opinions on

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:00.760
 what should constitute a cookie, but for me, mushrooms shouldn't constitute a food stuff

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.320
 really. But you just don't, you just don't like them. Yeah, that's true. Even seeing this

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:10.000
 one on the table. I'll tell you, I'll revolve my plate. There we go. Oh, that's great. The

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.600
 mushrooms were nice. And that's good because I can see the cherries eating yoghurt better

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.440
 now. Yeah, that's great. But you don't like to talk about that. Okay, and what else?

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.600
 Scramblies, beanies, mushroom. Oh, here's an interesting thing. There's the remnants

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.760
 of sauce on here. Very nice. But I did notice they don't have HP sauce here. No, they've

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.020
 got a stone of ketchup, which is very nice. But the other thing they had, they've got

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.560
 hash browns. We'll try a couple of. Steamed vegetables. So you feel, even though you're

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.040
 on your third course of breakfast, like, actually, I'm doing this for my health, which is a very

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.920
 nice feeling to have. Did you have some steamed those? Yeah, the broccoli, sweet garlic, carrots.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.880
 You'd be hard-pressed to find someone in the UK who thought that was a constant. Oh, absolutely.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.300
 Cookies. Also, the thing that they've also got up there, which I had the last couple

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:58.600
 of days, they've got arancini. Oh, that's right. Spinach and squash. Arancini. I buy arancini

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:04.200
 as a breakfast, actually. Yeah. Because if you are brunch, really, but if you make risotto

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.560
 the night before and you've made too much, there's nothing better than turning it into

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.160
 an arancini bowl next morning. It's just like a wet hash brown. Yeah, you're not really

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:18.480
 selling it there, but... Hash wet. Yeah, I like that. I thought the sausages

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.840
 went a bit insipid. I know you want the pizza now because you're a vegetarian. Vegetarian.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.020
 But weirdly, they're a lot smaller than the British sausages. Yeah. And they've got chicken

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:32.120
 sausages, which I always find a bit. Yeah. Sort of a crime against God and man. Well,

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.520
 in a way, they're a crime for God because often people do cardy-poor for religious reasons.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.480
 No. Are they? I believe so. That's interesting. I understand. But no, I agree. I don't trust

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.360
 the chicken sausage either. I think it's because the pig is basically the shape of a sausage,

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.960
 but the chicken is not. You know the beef? Yeah, yeah. How are you turning that into

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.200
 a sausage? There's something, something a bit round that's been done there to the chicken.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.960
 I've got a lot to tell you about the manufacturing process of meat, but we don't have time for

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.800
 that today. The pork sausage, it's fine, aren't they, right? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Right.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.600
 What they do is you know how you can tell the age of a tree. What you do is you put a little

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.400
 boring instrument into the tree. Yeah. You turn it around, you pull it out, and then you've got a

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.040
 cylinder of wood, and you can see how many rings there are. Yeah. Well, that's how they make sausages.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.760
 They put one of those instruments into a pig, twist it around, pull it out, and then you've got a

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.480
 perfect cylinder of pork. Of course. And the pig can carry on living. That just, that just grows

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.600
 back. That's amazing. Yeah. And that's why they're saying how the sausage gets made is a positive

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.240
 one. It really is. You want to see how the sausage gets made? Yeah. Yes, please. It's extremely

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:43.280
 awesome. Okay, so we've talked about the cookie. And now we're mixed carbs. Now we're mixed carbs.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:50.560
 And what you have left on your plate is a small pan of chocolat. Yeah. And a slice of toast.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:56.880
 Yeah, raisin loaf with honey. Very nice. Yeah? Yeah. Give it a thumbs up. I'm giving it a thumbs up.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.280
 I've already had some banana cake. Yeah. And I haven't been eating too much while we've had this

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.880
 time, but just for a bit of foley. Oh, yeah. To make clear what's going on. Okay, that's good.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:12.080
 Do you at home walk that? Do you want to hear that? I think you know what we're going for here.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:17.040
 We're going for the club fish members, but ultimately we're going for the ASMR. I'm just,

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:23.680
 I'm just chewing the toast now. That's good. It's a bit of character work around me there.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.440
 It's sexy stuff, isn't it? When people do ASMRs. I see. I thought you were doing a David Attenborough.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:37.120
 Oh, no, no. I was trying to do an online pervert market. Just to say, we're not saying that David

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:44.720
 Attenborough is an online pervert. Sorry, not. Yes. Okay, well, that's Andy's breakfast. Are you

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:51.360
 going to give us an out of 10? I'm going to give it four chicken sausages out of five. Wow. That's

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:57.280
 really good. Not giving you much space to go. No, it's been very good. That's true. And I should

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:04.000
 talk about my breakfast. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I've had a coffee and it's a very nice coffee,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.720
 and I'm going to give it four coffees out of five. Lovely. Okay, well, thank you very much for

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.400
 listening to Andy and James's breakfast club. We're not sure this is even going to go out,

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:20.080
 but if it does, it'll go out on club fish. And if I wake up early for any of our future

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:32.480
 breakfasts, we'll do this again. Okay, we're recording. So welcome back. I mean, welcome to

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:38.240
 James and Dan's breakfast club. Dan, if you've heard that I've been doing this with anyone

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:44.160
 else, it's not true. Yeah, there was rumours yesterday. No, no, you were my first choice to

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:52.640
 co-host this show, where we look at the breakfast that we've had on tour so far. So where are we

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:59.040
 right now? We're at the QT Hotel in Perth. Yeah, surprising to get Andy because he loves breakfast.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:06.640
 Yeah, he does. Yeah. He's a very busy man. Yeah, he is. And it's a sacred time for him.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:13.200
 Breakfast is the most sacred time for Andy of anything that I know of. If he was a religious

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.600
 man, the religion would be breakfast. Yeah, he's like a hobbit, isn't he? Except, well,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.880
 hobbits have multiple breakfasts at different times of the day. I did not know that. He doesn't

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.240
 in one go. Yeah, he's a breakfast king. He's a breakfast fiend. I was really worried. But he's

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:34.000
 not on this podcast. Well, that's just me and you, Dan. I think that's, yeah. It shows my favourite.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.760
 That's good. Thank you. And so what we're going to do is we're going to review our breakfasts.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:46.320
 But first of all, we are in Perth. Yeah. This is our second day in Perth. What have you been up to?

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:52.160
 So yesterday, I went, I've been doing this on, and I will be doing this for the whole tour every

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:58.560
 city we go to. I just go on a secondhand bookshop crawl. So I hit up about four secondhand bookshops,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:04.240
 the furthest away, which was about a 40 minute walk to get to. So are you buying new books in

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.800
 all these places? Well, no, famously, I'm buying secondhand books in all these places. Did I say

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.160
 new? I know you mean, am I buying new to you? New to me. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Are you buying,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.680
 really? So your baggage just goes up. Or do you throw them away once you've finished with them?

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:23.760
 No, I purposefully only packed one pair of underpants and socks. That explains so much.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:29.520
 But I did know I underpacked because I know that I'm going to be filling it up with toys for my kids

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:35.040
 and with books. Amazing. But they're very expensive here, books. It's a, this was always a big problem

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:40.800
 when I was growing up here is that you couldn't, like I felt like I couldn't afford to read. The

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:46.720
 UK is so much better. Book prices are fantastic. It really does explain a lot about your personality.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.920
 I think the listeners will agree that you are unable to read books until you left Australia.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:17:00.080
 Well, I, you know, we do have libraries and stuff here, but, but I'm a book owner. I need to own

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.680
 the books. How many books do you reckon you own? When I first moved in with vanilla, we were in a

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:13.360
 one bedroom flat and I had about 2000 books and I got rid of a lot of them. I gave them to charity

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:18.080
 shops and then like, you're going by in the back. Yeah. But weirdly, I was buying, I would get home

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.920
 with a few books I bought and I'd look inside and I had my name in it. And I was like, oh my god,

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.880
 I've re-bought the book that I, but I also used to have to keep the books outside in a bag. So I'd

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:32.240
 visit my books outside of our apartment in the garden out in the back. So at the moment, I'd say

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:39.120
 I've got like 2000 books, I reckon. Wow. Okay. I got a good fact about Perth. Oh yeah. This was

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.520
 something that someone actually sent into the show. I don't know if they put their name on it. Oh yeah,

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:50.560
 they did. Adriana sent in this fact. Perth's first female town planner, Margaret Failman,

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:56.560
 proved the town of Quinana needed to be established further back from the industrial strip by

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.960
 walking to the beach and setting a pile of tires on fire to show where and how far the smoke drifted.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.200
 Oh, cool. That's clever, isn't it? Yeah, that's really good. I've not heard of her. Fail, what was

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.320
 her name? Failman. You'd change your name if you were like trying to show that you could do

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:17.680
 something difficult. Yeah, I guess so. Although, you know, she was the first woman to be a town

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:23.200
 planner after all the men had failed, presumably. Okay. I guess, yeah, if that's, you can spin,

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.760
 you can spin your name. Okay, well, let's get to the important matter at hand.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:33.920
 Yes. Because this is James and Dan's Breakfast Club, where we will be assuming that you don't

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:41.280
 go the way of my former co-host of this show. We will be, sorry, I forget I said that, we'll be

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:49.760
 reviewing all of the breakfasts on this tour. Yeah. We are in the QT in Perth. What do you think?

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.400
 Well, this is our second breakfast here because we arrived here yesterday. I had the same thing

00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.000
 as I had yesterday. That's a good sign. Yeah, that's a good sign. What I had was smashed avocado

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.640
 on toast with two poached eggs on the side. Very Aussie, smashed avo. Smashed avo. And do you know

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:13.600
 what? It was dangerous today because I ordered my meal and it didn't come. Uh-oh. And the power

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.400
 of knowing that I was about to review the meal was something I've never experienced before.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.560
 Interesting. I suddenly felt like I was a different relationship with what was going on.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.280
 Yeah, yeah. Like the stakes were super high now for that.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.160
 You were mentally marking them down when your food didn't arrive.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.680
 I was very tempted to say, I'm afraid you don't realise but there's a breakfast

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.640
 reviewer sitting at the table. Upwards of a dozen people will be listening to this.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.600
 And none of them will live in Perth and probably ever visit Perth.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.800
 But maybe one person will be persuaded. Yeah, it was more just the exciting

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.240
 moment of realising I'm now a breakfast reviewer in a restaurant.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:59.520
 So, okay, did you have a go? I know because I was sat next to you.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:05.600
 It did arrive. It did arrive. It did arrive. Before I review mine, you had breakfast as well.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.640
 I just had coffee like I have everywhere. Oh, yeah.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:16.160
 So your breakfast did arrive eventually. In fact, in fairness, you said, oh, I don't think my

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.400
 breakfast has arrived and she came within, you know, 30 seconds.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.960
 Yeah. Now, what was interesting is when I said that sentence, yes, it was a very,

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.880
 it was the exact words that you just said, like, sorry, I think my breakfast...

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:36.640
 Actually, it was more like, excuse me, I am an important breakfast reviewer. Where's my grub?

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.520
 Now, what's interesting is I didn't say that, but the words I said were received like that

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.240
 because that was what was behind it. She knew. She went, oh my god, we've got

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:51.600
 Britain's leading breakfast reviewer here. I think you might be slightly overregging your

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.320
 credentials given that none of these episodes... In fact, this is the first one we've recorded.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.880
 We haven't even recorded one before this. Forget I said anything about that.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.960
 But yeah, they wouldn't know that you're a breakfast reviewer unless you just give

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.440
 off those vibes. Vibes is what I think it's about. I think people know. People know when

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:16.000
 someone's walked into a restaurant who is of a different caliber of review status.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.240
 Well, your review status is obviously, you know, we all know that you're a breakfast reviewer,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.080
 apart from the fact that we've got quite a long way into this episode and you haven't

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.680
 reviewed your breakfast yet. You just told us about what a great reviewer you are.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:36.320
 I'll be honest, I'm so nervous about my first review that I'm stalling. I'm trying to make time.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.960
 Did you hear that story, by the way, where Gordon Ramsay, someone was,

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:47.920
 is a comedian or a podcaster who tells a story and he says he's out to dinner with either on a date

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.440
 or with his wife and they're at the Gordon Ramsay's restaurant and she goes outside to have a

00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:00.400
 Siggi and so suddenly Gordon Ramsay comes out of the kitchen. He's got a, he's put a towel over his

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.520
 shoulder. Yeah, and he's walking around and he goes around to the table. "Hey, how's it going?

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.200
 Great, great, great." And then he says, "All right, I've got to get back to the kitchen." He goes back

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.720
 into the kitchen and then the girlfriend/wife comes back down, sits at the table and she's missed

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:19.840
 the whole thing and he says, "You're not going to believe what happened." But Gordon himself came

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.080
 out and he went and he said, "Hi to everyone." And he's back in, he's back into the cooking.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.800
 And she said, "Oh my god, I was about to say you won't believe what you just missed." Which is,

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:34.800
 she saw a car pull outside of the restaurant. Gordon Ramsay jumped out of it, ran around the back,

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.520
 went into the kitchen, came, did his whole thing, came back out, went back into the car and zoomed

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:45.280
 off all while she was having her Siggi. And so apparently that's what he does sometimes. Well,

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:52.240
 he is alive and suing. So we should say that is very much hearsay. And not my story, just passing

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:58.880
 on. Yeah, but wow, what an amazing, you still haven't reviewed this breakfast. Yes, so, um,

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:03.600
 smash Davos. Was it smoking in here? What's going on? It's just the ambiance. It's ambiance. It's

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.160
 very nice ambiance in this hotel. It is, it's very good. And also the staff are awesome. Also,

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:13.600
 when we signed for our breakfast, the person said, "Are you staying in the same hotel

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:19.360
 where you're going to?" And we said, "Yes." And she said, "The breakfast there is fantastic."

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.720
 That's when we go to Auckland. Yeah, she knows I'm a reviewer. Why else would she say that?

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:32.240
 Why else would she sort of like hype up their breakfast? Yeah, she's fluffing you for a future

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.640
 review. Yeah, you know what's interesting about our breakfast is that this is a hotel that doesn't

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:42.960
 have a buffet. Okay, now we'll get into the point. Every hotel that we go to has a buffet. And so

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:48.000
 I've been nervous every morning because I'm worried that Andy's going to have a horrible day

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.920
 because of his three breakfast situation. He's now limited to one course. Yeah. So listeners to,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:02.240
 no, no, not listeners to this, because this is the first one. People who know Andy will know

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:09.280
 that he does tend to take four courses for his breakfast. Yeah. He'll have mixed carbs. He'll have

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:14.560
 what he calls the cookie, the cooked part. He'll have various different things. But he can't do

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.360
 that here because you're given a menu and you have to choose something off the menu. Yeah. So I

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:25.840
 saw him at breakfast yesterday and he actually was dealing with it okay. Was he? Yeah. But he said,

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:32.240
 lean times for Murray. And I think he must have gone out and had more breakfast because I can't,

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:38.000
 he can't live like that. No, he's got magic rings to find. Is that what happens in a hobbit?

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:44.880
 There is a one ring. Is there a magic ring? Yeah. It's the ring. It's the one true ring.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.800
 Okay. So they gave you a menu. Yeah. And you had to choose something off the menu.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.880
 You chose the smashed avo and eggs. Yeah. How was it?

00:24:52.880 --> 00:25:01.840
 Yeah. It was, I love Australian food, right? The produce here is amazing. It's next level.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.800
 That's the first time I've heard that actually. Produce really. Yeah. That's good. That's interesting.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:13.040
 Yeah. I think every bit of food here in my experience, but I'm an Aussie so I'm biased,

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:19.200
 but I think it's far superior to most countries that I've been to. I think if you ask people around

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:25.360
 the world to name which country has the best cuisine, you'd be hard pressed to find anyone

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.320
 outside of Australia who would say Australia. Yeah. I know. So I'm bigging it up. I'm giving it.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:35.680
 So you really enjoyed your smashed avo? I did. Well, what happened is when they gave it to us,

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:41.200
 I asked for some chili. Gemini Tabasco said, and she came back with two options. She gave me the

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:47.760
 house bottle, which as I'm to understand it, only reviewers get handed. And she gave me the Tabasco.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:52.880
 So here's somebody definitely knows. She's pushing the locals. She's like, we need to get him

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:59.520
 talking about our chili. And hey, well done, lady. I am. It could be that they just have really,

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.960
 really good service. Yeah. And everyone gets treated really well. Not just you because they

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:11.440
 think you're a reviewer. Interesting. We'll never know. We will never know. Because yesterday,

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:17.760
 I wasn't a reviewer. I don't feel like I got the service I got today. I certainly didn't get a

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:23.920
 second house chili yesterday. No. Did you ask for Tabasco yesterday? No. No, that'll be a part of

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.640
 it probably. At least part of the reason you didn't get given two is because you didn't even ask for

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:33.040
 one. That could very well be yes. Yeah. But there was someone at our table yesterday who had scrambled

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:38.960
 eggs on toast. And I inherited half of their scrambled eggs because it was overflowing because

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:44.720
 there's so much produce here. The produce. It's so much produce that they can't, they have to get

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.120
 rid of it all. Otherwise it's just going to, so if you order eggs on toast here, you're getting

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:55.120
 quadruple the amount of eggs because they need to shift this stuff. And so, yeah. So I actually

00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:00.400
 had a breakfast and a bit of someone else's breakfast yesterday. Yeah. So you're also allowed to have

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:06.800
 coffee. Yeah. Had one. Which is what I have for breakfast. Yeah. A coffee. And my coffee was very

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:16.240
 nice. I did want a black americano and was looked at as if I just invented some new words. Yeah.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.320
 Because that's not what they called in Australia. But they did eventually give me something that

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:26.800
 resembled that and it was, it was extremely delicious. So yeah, coffee I would say definitely a solid

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:34.960
 three and a half teaspoons out of five. Oh, okay. And what would you say? What is your

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:40.800
 final score for your breakfast? For my breakfast? This is your big moment reviewer. Yeah. This is

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.440
 your review, right? Okay. Everyone, a lot of people, when you've got breakfast reviews,

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:50.480
 they don't really read all of the pros. Yeah. Who cares? They just want to see that score at the

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.480
 top. Yeah. And that will make them decide whether they're going to eat breakfast in a place. Yeah.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.440
 Okay. Well, there's obviously a lot of things to take into account. One thing was the bread,

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:04.560
 which looked like a very hardened bread, was extraordinarily easily sliceable. That was a

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.680
 real big difference. Like sometimes if you get a big sort of chunk of sourdough,

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.920
 especially if it's toasted, yeah, it can be quite chewy and difficult to eat. Exactly.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.880
 This was smooth as hell, very useful to cut in half because I was able to experiment with the

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:27.680
 local chili oil versus the Tabasco. Yeah, exactly. And so chili oil review, actually,

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:35.120
 the Tabasco had more kick. So I would say, you know, they need to work on that. So that's,

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:42.080
 I'll give that two flaming bum holes out of five for the chili. Two flaming bum holes, okay.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:48.080
 Yeah, for the chili review. For the meal itself, I'm going to give it a three. Three out of five.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.200
 Three. Yeah, it wasn't extraordinary. It was down the line good. The produce, as I say, is

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:58.640
 wonderful. So, you know, five out of five for the produce. But the staff are amazing. They made

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:05.440
 you feel like you were a breakfast reviewer. Oh, yeah. Okay. Well, this is the first of, I'm sure,

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:10.320
 many episodes of James and Dan's Breakfast Club. Oh, I look forward to being back for

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:17.680
 the next app. Yeah. Yeah. I'll let you know. I'll drop you a WhatsApp when we're next doing it.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:23.280
 If I don't drop your WhatsApp, it's probably because we just dropped the feature. We're just

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.240
 not going to run it because obviously it's an experiment. So don't worry if I don't get back

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:34.000
 to you on that. But thank you, Dan Shriver, for your excellent review. Oh, thank you,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:44.240
 yeah, for having me and your welcome.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.820
 (upbeat music)
