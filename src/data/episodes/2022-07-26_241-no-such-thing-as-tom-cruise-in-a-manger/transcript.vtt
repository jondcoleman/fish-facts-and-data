00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
 (electronic music)

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.080
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.080
 (electronic music)

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.920
 (electronic music)

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:22.040
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.160
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.000
 This week coming to you live from our book of the year,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.160
 2018 Tour in Norenga!

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.660
 (cheering)

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.040
 I am sitting here with Anichezinski,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.240
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and Jane Tarkin.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.700
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.000
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.160
 Starting with you, Anichezinski.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.600
 - Yes, my fact this week is that old European malaria remedies

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.480
 included throwing the patient headfirst into a bush

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.120
 in the hope that he'd get out quickly enough

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.840
 to leave the fever behind.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.600
 (laughing)

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.280
 Yeah, just got tangled up in there, can't get out,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.880
 and you scarper, that was how you did it.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.240
 And this was used all the way up until the 17th century,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.720
 basically until the 1600s, no one knew how to cure malaria.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.080
 And so they just made up a lot of wacky shit.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.320
 And I wonder what they thought happened to the malaria in the bush?

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.800
 Did it stay there, like if you went through a walk through the bush?

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.920
 - Yeah, it is a cup.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.800
 - It is a bit like that, so it's called passing through.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.560
 And it's kind of an old folklore thing.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.360
 They did it for lots of different diseases.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.040
 Sometimes it would be a hole in a tree or a hole in a stone

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.160
 or something like that, and you would pass through the hole.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.520
 And the idea is you would leave the disease behind you.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.400
 And actually it happened in America,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.160
 they didn't, perhaps they didn't have trees or stones,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.200
 but they used to climb under the belly of a donkey.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.800
 And the idea is you would leave your disease behind.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.960
 - And is it that it gets so distracted by the inside of the tree

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.320
 or the belly of the donkey that it goes,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.400
 "Oh, look, and it loses sight of it."

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.400
 - I don't think so.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.760
 - I don't think they really knew what was going on with it.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.120
 - Yeah, malaria is not like me,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.920
 just distracted by any idiotic thing.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.720
 Ooh, what's wrong with it?

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.840
 - But yeah, so of course the, as soon as the tree

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.360
 that has quinine in it was discovered suddenly,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.640
 everyone could be cured of malaria.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.920
 And that was in, well, this is by Western Europeans,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.240
 it was discovered in the 17th century.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.400
 So they went over to Peru,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.400
 and they found the indigenous people were just using the bark

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.280
 from this tree called the canchona tree.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.440
 You know, that's how you pronounce it.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.080
 And that just cures it.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.080
 And so they started using it,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.440
 and then all their problems were over,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.560
 no more running in and out of bushes.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.240
 - Yeah, it was a tough time up until then.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.720
 - It was, 'cause there's quite a few other things

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.440
 they tried as well as the bush thing, wasn't it?

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.200
 It wasn't just the bush thing.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.960
 So eating an onion with the word armen on it.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.240
 - With the word armen?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.240
 - Armen.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.560
 - Was this for malaria to get rid of them?

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.400
 - Yeah, the armen.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.720
 - Well, it didn't work either.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.240
 - But you can't, I mean, very few anions have the word armen on them.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.360
 - So if you can find one of those,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.600
 I think you deserve to be cured.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.320
 - Yeah, you were allowed to write it on yourself.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.840
 - Oh, fine.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.200
 - Smirring cow manure on your body,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.760
 drinking opium-laced beer,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.280
 that was quite a good one, actually.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.320
 There was a guy called Alberta's Magnus,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.320
 he was the Dominican scholar,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.880
 and he said, allowing insects to devour

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.080
 77 small cakes made from a dough

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.840
 prepared by mixing flour and the patient's urine.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.400
 - Right.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.720
 - Just on the beer one that you said,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.520
 well, no, no, no.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.600
 - Don't you kind of glossed over a slightly more?

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.920
 - A 77, allowing the flies to eat 77 small cakes.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.440
 - Can't be any insects.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.160
 - Oh, fine, okay.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.280
 Do you have to open a tiny gregs for them,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.160
 which says we have urine cakes inside?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.920
 - Can I just say for the people at gregs,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.560
 I'm sure you don't sell urine cakes, I've never...

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.080
 They're never sponsoring us chains, we could say what we like.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.800
 (laughing)

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.760
 - Actually, Kate Guy was a guy called Alberta's Magnus,

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.080
 wasn't it, who was, this guy in the 13th century

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.640
 who came with loads of wacky cures,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.840
 and another one of his familiaria was that

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.960
 you could cut a chip off a block

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.440
 that a criminal had been executed on,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.000
 and then rub it all over your body

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.760
 if you were suffering from it.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.760
 And that scared off the malaria,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.080
 'cause it reminded it of the penalty for being evil.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.200
 Reminded the evil malaria,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.400
 that maybe it'll be hanged one day

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.480
 if it doesn't go away.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.720
 - And that's where we get the phrase,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.600
 a chip off the old block on which a criminal was executed.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.400
 - It is, exactly, yes.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.400
 - I've got a real cure for malaria.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400
 - Okay.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.120
 - Viagra, can fight malaria.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.440
 Did you know this? - Yeah.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.080
 - So, okay, the malaria parasite, it gets into your body

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.640
 and it goes into red blood cells for a while.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.560
 It spends a while in there in your bone marrow,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.720
 and the spleen's job is to filter out, you know,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.120
 old or dead or stiff red blood cells,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.200
 and so the malaria normally sneakily passes through.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.920
 However, and that means it spreads through the blood.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.480
 However, if a patient takes Viagra,

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.440
 the infected blood cells themselves stiffen up.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.440
 (audience laughing)

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.200
 - It literally makes your blood cells go stiff.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.520
 - Yes, I know that, that, that, that, that, that.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.560
 - I knew that it made other things go stiff.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.520
 I just didn't know that it made the actual blood cells

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.360
 in your body go stiff.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.200
 - I think it's true.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.680
 - If you dilute Viagra and put it in a plant part,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.040
 it makes a plant go stiff.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.720
 - Get away.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.520
 - I didn't know individual cells

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.120
 getting individual little erections.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.640
 - Exactly.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.360
 But it does, it will present the mosquitoes

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.680
 with a big target as well to go through.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.320
 - How come when you eat Viagra then,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.840
 it doesn't make a tongue stiff?

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.360
 (audience laughing)

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.480
 - I think that, no, in fairness, that's quite a good point.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.760
 - That's a great point.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.040
 - How come, basically, anyone who's taken Viagra

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.120
 the whole body just isn't completely stiff?

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.920
 (audience laughing)

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.760
 - I don't know.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.360
 - Well, he gave it as a starfish.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.200
 - All right.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.360
 - I'm ready.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.720
 (audience laughing)

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.680
 - But starfish have got five limbs

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.160
 and you've only got, oh no, yeah.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
 (audience laughing)

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.480
 (audience applauding)

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.360
 Anyway.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.920
 Dr Butler, there was a famous doctor called Dr Butler,

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.720
 and his way of treating malaria was by dropping people

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.440
 through a trap door on London Bridge

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.160
 into the polluted river Thames.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.520
 - There used to be a trap door in London Bridge.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.880
 (audience laughing)

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.560
 - I mean, that's, I didn't think of that,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.720
 but yeah, that is where, isn't it?

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.880
 - Wow.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.360
 - So would he have to lure them onto the trap door?

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.160
 - Would they know they're gonna be dropped

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.400
 through the trap door?

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.120
 Or does he say, pay me the money?

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.040
 And I'll show you where the cure is.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.280
 (audience laughing)

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.120
 It's just over here.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.120
 - I think, it's a really good question.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.960
 I really don't know.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.040
 'Cause this guy wasn't great.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.720
 He had a habit of treating epilepsy

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.920
 by firing a gun beside the victim's head.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.520
 (audience laughing)

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.360
 - He was the physician to James I.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.680
 So he was like, you know, he's a real deal.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.600
 Well, no, he wasn't the real deal, but, you know.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.880
 - But you said that like, James I first

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.600
 who famously lived for 700 years,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.720
 like, how did he die?

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.800
 26, malaria.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.800
 (audience laughing)

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.920
 Hey, do you know the oldest example of malaria

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.200
 that we found in a human that we have now?

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.040
 - No.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.600
 - It's Tutankhamun.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.440
 - Is it?

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.880
 - Yeah, they've recently discovered a few years ago now

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.680
 that Tutankhamun actually has types of,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.760
 not even one type, a few types of malaria inside him.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.120
 And that would have contributed

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.680
 to his immune system going down.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.440
 So they don't think it's what killed him,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.720
 but they think it's what, you know, added to his problems

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.560
 of his feet being bad and whatever it was.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.680
 We don't actually know what killed him.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.440
 I think he was possibly crushed by a hippo,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.040
 but it's possible that the malaria

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.720
 and not back the reflexes, it's possible.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.240
 - It's not possible.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.320
 - Everything's possible, you know, maybe in the sarcophagus,

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.520
 he was very, very flat.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.800
 (audience laughing)

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.120
 - He also had syphilis, didn't he?

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.400
 He had everything Tutankhamun.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.680
 He was the first, he had the first socks and sandals,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.880
 I think, in the world.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.520
 He just, always on it.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.320
 In fact, malaria can cure syphilis.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.240
 So maybe he had malaria to cure his syphilis.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.080
 - That's possible.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.000
 - So this is a genuine thing.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.560
 Yeah, someone won the Nobel Prize for this in,

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.080
 this was in 1917 that it was discovered,

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.240
 and it was an Austrian physician called Julius Wagner-Jorreg.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.880
 And he realized that the fever that could be induced

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.960
 by malaria was hot enough to cure syphilis.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.640
 And so yeah, he got the Nobel Prize

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.920
 and that was used until 1940, if you had syphilis,

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.680
 then you would be infected deliberately with malaria.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.520
 - And don't worry, we've got some gonorrhea for the malaria.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.760
 (audience laughing)

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.280
 And then we've got some dengue fever for the gonorrhea.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.600
 It's like the old woman who swallowed a fly.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.680
 (audience laughing)

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.200
 That was infected with malaria.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.920
 (audience laughing)

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.440
 - There's a town, a city in fact in Australia

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.440
 called Townsville and 7,000 families there

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.640
 have been nannying mosquitoes recently.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.480
 - This is what we mean by that.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.320
 - Within the last year or two.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.880
 So they've all hosted a tub of mosquito eggs

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.440
 in their backyard, and they've watered them

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.000
 and kept them nice and cool and moist and nurtured them.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.760
 Because those mosquitoes have all been infected

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.160
 with a bacteria, which means they're less able

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.440
 to transmit dengue and Zika viruses.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.880
 And they're the ones where you're gonna try

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.280
 and get them to mate with the other mosquitoes.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.120
 - Exactly.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.960
 - Yeah.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.040
 - So they're breeding millions and millions,

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.720
 and everyone in the town has agreed to it.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.960
 They said, yeah, great, bring on the good mosquitoes.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.800
 - That is good.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.640
 - Yeah.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.480
 - It's a rubbish pet.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.640
 If you ask for a dog, you've got 1,000 mosquitoes.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.480
 You're really pissed off.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.760
 - And it's wrapped up under the tree in the shape of a dog,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.080
 but in fact, 2,000 mosquitoes.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.760
 - I mean, you're never gonna wrap a dog are you?

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.840
 (laughing)

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.280
 - Well, people are trying to find malaria vaccines still.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.480
 And it seems to be habit to infect yourself

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.880
 with malaria to work out what works.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.040
 But also in the past, people infected other people.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.280
 So, we often talk about self-experimentation

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.920
 and it's kind of these heroes who poison themselves

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.120
 so they can work out how to cure themselves.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.480
 But there was a guy called Dr. Gracie in 1898

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.200
 who really wanted to work out,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.440
 who really wanted to prove that malaria was caused

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.920
 by the Anophilese Mosquito, which it is.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.440
 And no one would believe him.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.640
 And so he got a volunteer called Mr. Solar

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.040
 to be locked in a room in a tiny box

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.560
 for 11 days filled with malaria infected mosquitoes

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.480
 until he got one of the 11 days.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.640
 - Yeah, it took, yeah.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.800
 I mean, oh wow.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.800
 - And the sad thing is we know that he got malaria

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.680
 because it was a successful experiment.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.440
 So this guy, Dr. Gracie, was thrilled.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.160
 He was like, now I've proven that the Mosquito cures malaria.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.000
 And in his case notes, he writes,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.840
 "The rest of the history of Mr. Solar's case

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.760
 "has no interest for us, but it is now certain

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.360
 "that mosquitoes carry malaria."

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.120
 So, oh my God. - Did not care, yeah.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.960
 - Wow.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.520
 I was looking into the idea of all these old, you know,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.160
 suggestions for how you cure things.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.120
 So outside of malaria, there's everyone,

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.720
 every single disease seemed to have an eccentric thing

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.600
 assigned to it.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.200
 And one of my favorite ones is if you had swollen eyes,

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.560
 the way that they suggested,

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.400
 Dr. Suggested, that you cure it,

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.400
 was that you tied a live crab to a necklace on your chest,

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.360
 and you just let it live there.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.920
 And no, I mean, nobody will notice your swollen eyes

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.760
 ever again.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.800
 (laughing)

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.840
 - You just tie it around your neck

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.320
 and you just have a live crab and that will cure it.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.600
 - Cool.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.160
 I didn't know swollen eyes was really a thing.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.000
 I was like, around the ear, so it's not swollen at all.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.920
 - It's thanks to the crap cure that was so successful.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.360
 That's why everyone's got normal eyes.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.840
 - We wiped it out, yeah.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.840
 (laughing)

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.480
 - I was just saying before about these mosquitoes

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.440
 in town, they're gonna send them out to have sex

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.560
 with other mosquitoes.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.760
 And I looked into how mosquitoes have sex.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.040
 And one interesting thing I found is,

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.360
 it's the females that bite you.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.920
 And so what some male mosquitoes will do,

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.320
 is they'll find a human and then just hang around the human

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.200
 waiting for females to come.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.040
 - Wow.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.600
 - So like the human is just like a singles bar or something.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.120
 (laughing)

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:55.960
 - That's so cool.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.920
 - So you might just have a little mosquito flying around

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.720
 and you're like, "Oh God, say, can he's just waiting

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.520
 for a bit of Lady Mosquito."

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.840
 - Wow.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.160
 - It's quite risky then landing on you though.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.240
 Going to that bar is a risky affair.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.080
 'Cause I didn't realize.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.080
 - That's the dating scene.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.720
 (laughing)

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.360
 - Oh, you gotta put yourself out there.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.480
 And they do.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.840
 But the reason they suck our blood is to feed their eggs.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.680
 So that's why it's only the females.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.560
 But they, as soon as they've sucked it,

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.360
 they're so full they can't move anymore.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.080
 So every time a mosquito is sucking on your blood,

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.160
 it's risking its own life.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.680
 'Cause if you spot it and spot it in time

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.120
 and that's why you often can,

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.280
 it can't really fly away.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.640
 It's got this giant sack of blood now inside it.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.480
 - Wow.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.120
 - It's actually really worse for them than it is for you.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.480
 - We're gonna have to move on in a second.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.160
 Or an X-Fact.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.720
 Do you wanna say something Andy or no?

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.880
 - It's just a follow-on fact from that, really.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.960
 But it's not relevant enough to end this,

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.800
 to end the second.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.640
 - No, no, no.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.000
 - Well, man, bring it home.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.840
 - Oh God.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.120
 It's not good, it's not good.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.520
 It's just that Mosquitoes are victims as much as we are

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.280
 because they're carrying the malaria parasite,

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.080
 but there's a theory that Mosquitoes

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.600
 are actually made a bit crazy

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.400
 by having the parasite inside them

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.240
 and it makes them extra keen to suck blood.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.400
 So they would do it anyway,

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.080
 but the parasite makes them basically like vampire mosquitoes.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.760
 - And the other thing is they get sick.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.640
 Mosquitoes get sick, so it's a bit harsh on them.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.120
 If they've got this malaria parasite there sick,

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.080
 and also we blame them for kind of spreading it,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.880
 but Mosquitoes don't get on airplanes

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.520
 and fly around and stuff like that.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.160
 Mosquitoes stay near that little place where they live.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.440
 What happens is humans get bitten, humans go somewhere else,

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.840
 and they get bitten again and make a poor Mosquito sick,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.200
 and then that Mosquito gets loads of other people sick.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.360
 So it's the humans who are doing all the spreading around.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.960
 The poor Mosquitoes are just flying around,

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.480
 getting sick and then getting squashed.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.720
 - Oh.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.080
 - The real enemy is man.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.440
 (laughing)

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.920
 (upbeat music)

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.360
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.880
 and that is my fact.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.560
 My fact this week is that,

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.760
 instead of commissioning new wax works

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.080
 for their exhibitions,

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.600
 the Bible Walk Museum in Ohio

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.680
 repurposes discarded wax works from around the world instead.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.960
 As a result, Abel is played by Prince Charles.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.960
 (audience laughing)

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.040
 King Solomon is played by John Travolta,

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.720
 and Jesus is played by Tom Cruise.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.160
 (audience laughing)

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.960
 And I encourage you to go online and look at these photos,

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.160
 'cause Tom Cruise makes a good-looking Jesus.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.400
 (laughing)

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.680
 - It is in baby Jesus, like Nativity scene.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.960
 (laughing)

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.880
 It is manger, and then you pull as little rug down,

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.240
 and it's Tom Cruise's face, baby.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.520
 - Yeah, it's Tom Cruise with the help it's ordered.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.360
 - Yeah.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.200
 - Like a mission impossible,

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.040
 the way he always pulls off the rubber mask,

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.760
 and it's Tom Cruise underneath.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.560
 You thought I was the baby Jesus?

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.680
 Well, you were wrong.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.640
 You're a really good boy.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.800
 Yeah, so this is a very almost famous in American museum.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.720
 The Bible Walk Museum, it was started

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.640
 by Pastor Richard Diamond in 1983.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.080
 He was inspired after he visited another wax museum.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.120
 Not the greatest origin story, sort of expected or best.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.560
 And he wanted to do it and tell the story of the Bible,

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.680
 but he realized how expensive it was to make new wax works.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.200
 So he thought there's a lot that are closing down all the time.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.360
 There's a lot that are selling them off at auction.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.480
 Let's just buy these.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.600
 And they tend to be celebrities, so yeah.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.720
 - That's the thing, like no one knows what Abel looked like.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.560
 Do they?

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.200
 He might look like Prince Charles, I don't know.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.040
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.160
 They gave Prince Charles, when you see that photo,

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.880
 a sort of putting bowl haircut.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.000
 So they mess with the hair.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.440
 They don't leave the head untouched.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.720
 They still dress them up, and they, yeah.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.560
 And it looks really good.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.080
 And Steve McQueen is there, and George Harrison is there.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.680
 And Marlon Brando, and Bert Lancaster, and Clark Gable.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.520
 It's, yeah.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.520
 - That's an unbelievably cool selection of people.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.360
 You just listed.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.080
 - You might be open with Prince Charles,

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.520
 and you've got your Clark Gables and your Steve McQueens.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.720
 Are they all the wise men?

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.400
 - No, they're all just random bit parts.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.720
 There's no, they've got no starring roles.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.600
 Surely Jesus is a starring role

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.000
 at a Biblically themed walkthrough wax work museum.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.160
 - There are also, there are quite a few Jesuses in there,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.560
 because it's all of Jesus' life and stuff like that.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.640
 So at one stage, Prince Philip is being resurrected.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.120
 - Prince Philip, yeah.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.960
 - They've got the age of Jesus at resurrection wrong,

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.240
 I think that's directly, so do people not mind that?

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.800
 - No, they actively love it.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.200
 And that's the problem that the Biblically walked museum has

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.880
 is that they don't like people liking that.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.040
 They think it takes away from the story of Jesus.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.720
 So, if you call up, if anyone wants to visit them,

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.840
 don't call up and say, hey, can you give us the celebrity

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.800
 tour, they will not let you into the museum.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.040
 They actively say, you're not coming now.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.200
 - Really?

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.040
 - I think so.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.360
 (audience laughs)

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.960
 I'm pretty sure I read that, but they don't encourage that at all.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.400
 And they do think it takes away.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.600
 - I think they've got to make up their minds.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.160
 Either be so stingy, you're going to repurpose

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.000
 tacky old wax works for your museum or fork out

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.760
 and don't complain about, you know?

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.360
 I think if you're going to do it, embrace it.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.240
 Like they did, in fact, so Madame Two Swords

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.840
 did an activity thing in 2004,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.800
 and they deliberately put loads of their

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.480
 Madame Two Swords icons in the Nativity.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.720
 And so it had the three wise men,

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.600
 were Tony Blair, the Duke of Edinburgh,

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.560
 again, and George Bush.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.040
 So this is all relevant to people.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.640
 It was an ironic thing, I think.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.520
 Joseph and Mary were posh and becks.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.360
 - Oh.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.760
 - But this was really unpopular.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.000
 - Yeah, it's going to say, did the Catholics

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.480
 and Christians not like that very much at that time?

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.800
 - They did not like it at all.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.640
 No, the Vatican spokesman in Britain said

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.920
 it was really disrespectful to Christianity.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.440
 And the exhibition actually closed before Christmas

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.000
 because someone got in, so cute, got their ticket,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.760
 then went straight up to Joseph and Mary

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.880
 and punched them in their face.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.720
 - Oh.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.040
 - Yeah.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:41.880
 - Wow.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.480
 Do you know, just speaking of Madame Two Swords,

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.160
 do you know what the wax work Tom Daly,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.520
 the diver, has that most other wax works.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.880
 So anatomically, what he has that most other wax works don't have.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.040
 - Well, he's very strong.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.480
 Is he, does he have a six pack?

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.960
 - I'm sure he does.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.800
 - Yeah.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.640
 - But so does Prince Philip.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.480
 So that's not.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.200
 (laughing)

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.000
 - I'm just trying to not go for the obvious.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.880
 - Does he have a lunch pack?

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.080
 - No, no, he doesn't.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.320
 - Such a box, I think, is what it's called.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.320
 Are you sure?

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.560
 - I'm pretty sure, yeah, yeah.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.400
 - You confused me.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.920
 I thought you actually meant someone packed it.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.760
 - I'm sure.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.800
 - I don't think he doesn't have a pack lunch.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.200
 - No, it's feet.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.400
 He has feet.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.520
 What, the others don't have feet?

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.520
 - Most wax works just have the shoes

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.080
 and they have a very good sort of metal inside,

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.840
 almost like what you put a shoe horn into a shoe.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.280
 So yeah, Donald Trump's wax work, for example,

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.880
 definitely no feet, it's just his shoes.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.760
 - Most of them, I think, you can get by

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.640
 just with head and hands.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.880
 So after they've finished with,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.560
 so for example, what happened to David Cameron

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.760
 after he stopped being Prime Minister

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.560
 was his Madame Tussauds' wax work

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.880
 was decapitated and had his hands chopped off

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.000
 and they were kept in storage 'cause they, oh!

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.080
 (audience laughing)

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.320
 Some applause.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.600
 I don't think we're in that divided country yet.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.600
 (audience laughing)

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.480
 So they never, they think is they never melt anyone down.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.180
 They never melt down a head or hands

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.620
 'cause those are the most difficult fiddly

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.060
 and the most personal bits to do.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.180
 - Yeah, so it's kind of cheating.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.340
 They're not making wax models,

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.980
 they're just making wax hands and a head.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:13.820
 - Or wax hands.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.620
 - There's an amazing book about Madame Tussauds,

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.180
 which is by Pamela Pillbeam and I read a bit of it.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.580
 In the 19th century, Madame Tussauds had a life orchestra

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.220
 playing as you walked around

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.220
 and it was a really classy thing to do.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.340
 You could touch anyone you liked, I'm pretty good.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.580
 But do you mean the models?

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.380
 'Cause it's gonna put off the violinist, isn't it?

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.380
 (audience laughing)

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.860
 Fondle the orchestra.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.900
 You're still hard to touch, Madame Tussauds.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:40.740
 I think that's the whole point.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.580
 - On the option.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.420
 - Are you?

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.260
 - I think so.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.460
 - I don't know, I haven't been for years.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.020
 When I used to go, you weren't allowed to touch them,

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.660
 but I think more recently, they've allowed you

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.820
 to kind of put your arms around them

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.060
 and take selfies and stuff.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.420
 - Yeah, I think we've mentioned before

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.580
 that they know that Brad Pitt

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.020
 is the most groped of the wax works

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.260
 at Madame Tussauds.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.100
 - Yeah.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.100
 - How do they know?

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.260
 They have someone watching.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.380
 - No, the reason they know is because it's the one

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.500
 that they need to replace most often.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.780
 Because people keep touching it,

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.580
 so it keeps the trousers need replacing

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.420
 and stuff like that.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.260
 - Yeah.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.420
 (audience laughing)

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.940
 - Oh, well, well.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.420
 - Like I say, I haven't been for years.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.180
 (audience laughing)

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.340
 Because I'm banned.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.660
 (audience laughing)

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.260
 But Tom Hardy, for instance,

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.340
 the Tom Hardy model at Tussauds,

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.060
 he has a beating heart and a soft, warm torso.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:27.900
 - What?

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.740
 - What?

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.220
 - So if you weren't allowed to touch him,

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.060
 there'd be no point having that, would there?

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:32.900
 - Yeah.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:33.900
 - Is it actually Tom Hardy?

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.020
 'Cause he is very still in a lot of his shows, anyway, isn't he?

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.420
 - He's just had a lot of high anger,

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.340
 and he's stiffened him hard.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.540
 (audience laughing)

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.620
 Arnold Schwarzenegger actually did that.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.460
 - Yeah.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.100
 - Arnold Schwarzenegger, there was a thing he was promoting,

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.100
 and for a stunt, he just stood in Madame Tussauds,

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.620
 dressed up like the terminator, you know,

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.780
 with the sort of metal showing through and injured,

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.460
 and then he would move and freak people out.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.460
 (audience laughing)

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.180
 - Some of the religious kind of things

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.020
 that you can go and see.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:01.860
 - Yeah.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.260
 - The world's largest wooden construction,

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.020
 so the largest wooden construction in the whole world,

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.420
 is Noah's Ark.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.260
 - Wow.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.460
 - And it's a Noah's Ark in America,

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.620
 it's called the Ark Encounter,

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:17.460
 and it fits over 16,000 people simultaneously inside it.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.500
 - But there are only supposed to be two, I thought.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.940
 (audience laughing)

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.340
 - What a space, they have a lot of space.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.940
 And, well, actually, there are a few more humans

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:28.940
 on Noah's Ark, wasn't there?

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:29.780
 - Yeah, there were.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.620
 - So there was Noah and his wife,

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.900
 and there were his sons, so there was Shem.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.060
 - Ham.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.740
 - And the third one who has the more complicated name.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.780
 Wait, someone knows it.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.780
 (audience laughing)

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:40.620
 - Jedwood.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.140
 (audience laughing)

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.220
 - That was two by two as well, Jedwood, wasn't it?

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.220
 (audience laughing)

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.460
 - I'm sorry, I heard Jedwood,

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.860
 because apparently in the Dublin Wax Museum,

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.420
 you can have a Jedwood made,

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.980
 but and there are only two for one deal.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.660
 (audience laughing)

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.660
 - Who wants it again?

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.060
 - Jedwood. - JPEG.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.060
 - JPEG.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:57.900
 Okay.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.060
 (audience laughing)

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.020
 So, it was, it was Shem Ham and JPEG.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:07.100
 But the amazing thing is that this massive Noah's Ark

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.940
 was made by a guy called Ken Ham,

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.580
 which is the same name as someone I know as Ark.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.140
 He's quite famous in America as being an extremely

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:19.140
 pious Catholic, anti-evolutionary kind of guy.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.900
 And Bill Nye, the science guy,

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.620
 he went to see this Noah's Ark,

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.540
 and he said on the third deck of the Ark,

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.260
 "Every single science exhibit is absolutely wrong."

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.180
 (audience laughing)

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.460
 Not just misleading, but wrong.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.300
 (audience laughing)

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.500
 So yeah, it's completely bad.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.500
 And then Ken Ham, by the way,

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.220
 is trying to, this year and last year,

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.460
 trying to put the Jesus back into Halloween.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.780
 (audience laughing)

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.380
 He's suggesting that people should go reverse trick

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.180
 or treating where you bring the baskets of goodies

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.060
 to bless your neighbors.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.940
 - And what if they don't want one?

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.180
 You have to do something nice to them?

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.020
 (audience laughing)

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.940
 (audience laughing)

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.500
 - Well, good luck with that, Mr. Ham.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.140
 - Did you know that baby Jesus theft

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.740
 has its own Wikipedia page?

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.900
 (audience laughing)

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.180
 - Is there much on it?

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.380
 - It's jam-packs to the rafters.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.660
 Yeah, so Jesus is always getting stolen at Christmas

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.780
 as it happens.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.620
 (audience laughing)

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.980
 And then there's this list that's always going neck

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.540
 from nativity scenes.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.060
 Marilyn Manson wants to stole a whole bunch of them.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.980
 He admitted later, he stole a whole bunch of Jesus'

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.580
 and actually oddly replaced them with Ham's.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.380
 (audience laughing)

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.180
 So maybe that was a tribute to Ken.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.020
 - Wow.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.100
 - I was thinking Marilyn Manson,

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.940
 did he not have a song called "Personal Jesus"?

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:31.780
 - Did he?

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.620
 - No, he did, didn't he?

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.900
 - So he's just going, "That's my personal Jesus."

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:34.740
 (audience laughing)

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.740
 "That's my personal Jesus."

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.460
 And actually, this is what you said earlier.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:42.020
 I read a quote from a historian of baby Jesus thefts

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.980
 who (audience laughing)

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.660
 he may have other strings to his boat

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:50.660
 who's called Daniel Silliman and (audience laughing)

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.780
 - Come on.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.900
 - Absolutely.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.300
 Sorry, Silliman, what's your very serious paper

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.140
 about this time?

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.380
 (audience laughing)

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.660
 Anyway, he said, "Baby Jesus thieves literally

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.180
 "take the Christ out of Christmas."

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.900
 - Oh.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.180
 - Which I think is worth reflecting on.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.020
 - Yeah.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.380
 Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.260
 and that is James.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.620
 - Okay, my fact this week is that a giraffe

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.020
 with breathing problems can be treated

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.820
 by using a leaf blower.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.660
 (audience laughing)

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.380
 - Is it on suck or blow?

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.140
 (audience laughing)

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.300
 - I think it's on blow.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.900
 - Or they're always on blow, aren't they?

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.340
 - Leaf blower is generally, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.020
 (audience laughing)

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.620
 - Otherwise they'd be leaf suckers.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.620
 (audience laughing)

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.940
 - My leaf blower sucks.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.980
 (audience laughing)

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.100
 So this, Andy was the only person

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.500
 in the room who found that funny, which (audience laughing)

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.380
 - So, where were you all?

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.300
 (audience laughing)

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.780
 - So, this is a 2007 paper by Cetano et al.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.260
 And what did al contributes to what he did?

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.420
 (audience laughing)

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.060
 - And what happened was they had to

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.260
 anesthetize a giraffe, but as anesthetized in it,

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.620
 and then it had trouble breathing,

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.300
 and they managed to fix it by getting a gas powered leaf blower

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.100
 and then attaching it to a few other parts

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.100
 and managed to artificially ventilate this giraffe.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.820
 - By blowing into it's mouth?

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.820
 - Through it's trickier and into it's lungs.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.660
 - Wow. - Ooh, wow.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.260
 - And got all the leaves out of it's inside.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.220
 (audience laughing)

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.300
 - Yeah, well, copy's like, is anyone else hungry?

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.620
 (audience laughing)

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.580
 - The thing I've always find weird about giraffes

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.740
 is that, I think we've done this on QI years ago,

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.620
 is that when they were first spotted by the Romans,

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.140
 they called them the camel leopard.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.780
 So they, someone saw a giraffe

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.260
 and thought, what's the striking thing about this?

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.380
 Well, it looks like it crossed me in a camel and a leopard.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.180
 And in fact, he noted, this animal is like a camel

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:51.020
 in all respects, except that its legs are not

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.140
 at the same length.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.660
 (audience laughing)

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.260
 - The skin is spotted like a leopard, so we're cool.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.820
 I mean, what about the neck place?

00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.660
 - Yeah, nice.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.180
 - This is something that wasn't looking up.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.620
 - You know, it was only until recently

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.940
 that we found out there was more than one giraffe.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.460
 That was a, you mean, more than what species of giraffe?

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.540
 - Yeah.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.500
 (audience laughing)

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.620
 - Because actually if they were all studying a line,

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.820
 and you could only see the one right next to you.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.180
 - Oh, yeah, I mean, there was more than one species.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:20.060
 So we thought up until now that it was just giraffe,

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.460
 and there was subspecies within giraffe,

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.140
 but now there's four.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:24.980
 - Wow.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.740
 - And what there's always been,

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.500
 but we've just suddenly been like, whoa, there's three more.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.300
 - So there's a thing about their nerves,

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.740
 and it's a really annoying thing for them.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.220
 It doesn't affect them too much, but so most vertebrates,

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.020
 we have these things called a laryngeal nerves,

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.380
 and they help to send signals to all the organs in your body.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:44.140
 And in all mammals, they branch off the vagus nerve,

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.500
 that how it's pronounced, at vagus nerve.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.780
 - Oh, that's good to know,

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.460
 because we mentioned that in this next episode

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:52.300
 that's going on.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.100
 - And you're not going to like how we say it.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.420
 (audience laughing)

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.420
 So they branch off the vagus nerve,

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.460
 and then one of them loops under the aorta,

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.940
 and then back to the, is it larynx?

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.940
 (audience laughing)

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.940
 (audience laughing)

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.500
 So then it loops back to the larynx,

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.580
 and it's a bit awkward, but it's only a few inches longer

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.380
 in almost all mammals.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.660
 Unfortunately, in giraffes, they've got these really long neck,

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.220
 so the nerve has to go on this massive detour

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.260
 all the way down.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.620
 So in humans, it's six inches long,

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.780
 and it should only be about six inches long for giraffes,

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.180
 but in giraffes, it's 15 feet long,

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.660
 'cause it has to go all the way down the neck,

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:31.500
 and then back up.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.660
 - Whoa, wow.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.860
 - And that's the nerve.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:34.900
 - That's the nerve, yeah.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.580
 - So does that mean if you like slap a giraffe

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.340
 on the chest, then it won't feel it for ages.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.220
 - Well, actually that is kind of true.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.740
 So this is not the vagus nerve,

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.900
 but one of the other nerves.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:49.260
 So it takes a rat 4.5 milliseconds to respond to stimuli.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.580
 If you stand on a rat's foot, it would take that long,

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.860
 but a giraffe, it takes 100 milliseconds

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.020
 to sense a response to something.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.660
 So like if you stand on a giraffe's foot,

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.740
 it would take what, I don't know, 25 times longer.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:02.580
 - Wow.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.820
 - So it'd be very dangerous drivers, wouldn't they?

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.140
 (audience laughing)

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.540
 - Very slow reactions.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.820
 (audience laughing)

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.580
 And also, you'd have to cut a hole

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.580
 and top of your car.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:13.820
 (audience laughing)

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.900
 It was, I think, the first giraffe that came over here,

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.340
 or the really famous giraffe that came to Britain in 1827,

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.500
 I think it was, came apparently in a boat

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.020
 where they had to have a hole drilled in the deck of the boat

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.420
 so that it could travel.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.580
 - Well, that was to France, wasn't it?

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.260
 - There were three, and they were given

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.420
 by the visor of Egypt, weren't they?

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.220
 And it was sort of like dealing cards.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.980
 He gave three giraffes, one to Britain,

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.900
 one to France, one to Austria,

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.460
 and bizarrely, they were transported from Egypt

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.020
 over to Western Europe on the backs of camels.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:44.860
 - Yeah.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:45.700
 - What?

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.540
 - Yeah.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:47.380
 - They were strapped to camel.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.180
 - They were, they were, they were small when they started.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.860
 They were, they were young giraffes when they started.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.700
 - Ah, alright.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.260
 - So for the first stage, they were put in a camel.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.100
 - Ah.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.300
 - So how long was the trip though?

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.780
 That's a long, it was, it's so long.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.220
 It took two and a half years to get them from Sudan

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.860
 to, no wonder, to the, trick the camel to begin with,

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.660
 by going, this guy's tiny, he'll be fine.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.940
 (audience laughing)

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.380
 One year in, this guy's, what the fuck is this?

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.620
 (audience laughing)

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.180
 This guy's just like me, but we're slightly longer legs.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.180
 (audience laughing)

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.540
 - It was amazing though.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.260
 They, so the one that went to France was called Zeraffa,

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.740
 and Zeraffa had three nannies who were all cows.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:26.580
 - Yes.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.340
 - Because he needed six gallons of milk every day

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.180
 to keep growing.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.020
 - Yeah.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:31.860
 - Wow.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.500
 - So these cows all went along for the ride as well.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.500
 - So wet nurse nannies, rather than,

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.580
 it wasn't nannies who played with him with rattles

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:41.420
 and stuff, was like, they suckled at the cows' teeth.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.020
 They must have had a massive identity crisis

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.020
 by the time they arrived.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.300
 - They suckled the cows' teeth.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.300
 - Yeah, they suckled.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.180
 - How do you suck a lot of cows' teeth?

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.100
 Is it's cow really, really high and still, so something?

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.340
 - The cow is on the back of a huge donkey.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.820
 (audience laughing)

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.380
 - Yeah, maybe they put the cow on stills,

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.220
 I don't know, it's not like a lot of effort to go to,

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.860
 but they suckled the cows.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:01.700
 - Wow.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:02.780
 - Yeah.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.660
 - We think that we thought, until recently,

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.020
 that giraffes were loners.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.460
 And now, apparently, it turns out,

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.620
 they can just see each other from further away.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.460
 (audience laughing)

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.300
 - And they genuinely, so...

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.580
 - But they couldn't talk to each other

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.700
 from that distance, could they?

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.020
 - They can communicate from a fair,

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.460
 I think from about a hundred feet away.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.900
 They can, 'cause they have infrastructure today.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.860
 - I think they can harm at volumes that we can't.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.580
 - Well, no, they've been here.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.180
 - Yeah, we've been for centuries.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.780
 I've been trying to work out how they communicate

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.740
 through voice, because they don't really hear

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.700
 giraffes communicating, so they think house is done.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.780
 And in zoos, they did a study to see whether or not

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.140
 they could capture them talking to each other.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.340
 And the conclusion is that they have found them

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.740
 talking to each other at night,

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.500
 and it is through, as you say, hums.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.580
 So they hear these hums,

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.580
 and they're done in different patterns and so on,

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.500
 so they think they're talking to each other.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.780
 There's a slight thought that it could also be them snoring.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:53.620
 They're not sure.

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.620
 (audience laughing)

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.780
 'Cause it's curious that they do it only at night.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.820
 - Maybe it's one of them snoring,

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.900
 and the other one's saying,

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.420
 "Can you just turn over, please?"

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.820
 (audience laughing)

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.660
 - That's it.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.260
 - Do you know the weirdest thing about giraffes

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.780
 are of all quadrupeds.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:11.340
 They're the only known ones that can't swim naturally.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.660
 So every single four-legged animal you've ever seen

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.620
 is a natural swimmer, and so not like we are,

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.820
 we have to learn to swim if you drop a baby in the water,

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.860
 it will sink, same with an ape, which actually they did.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.700
 I think in the early 20th century,

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.020
 they retrieved them, but they dropped lots of monkeys

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.180
 into water, watched them for a while,

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.580
 and they all flailed, and then sank quite quickly,

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.460
 then they got them out again.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.460
 - Do when you live by the ocean,

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.140
 as in I'm just wondering if they live inland,

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:37.580
 it's only lakes, they're probably tall enough,

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.860
 they've never had to learn to swim, 'cause they're next around.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.300
 - Maybe, crossing a river,

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.420
 you can just walk across the riverbed, aren't you?

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.500
 - Well, you don't know until you try.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.380
 As in, you don't know that a giraffe can't tell

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.500
 the depth of the river by just looking at it.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.180
 They'll come a point where you're walking into the river,

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.740
 and you think, "This is fine, this is fine,

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.900
 "this is not fine."

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.100
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.060
 - But then you're the exciting explorer,

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.860
 and then the rest of going, "All right, Mike didn't make it,

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.940
 "let's find another way."

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.900
 (laughing)

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.940
 We're gonna have to move on shortly.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.780
 Just quickly, I found the fact about leaf blowers

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:14.180
 and animals, so your fact was a giraffe

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.780
 with breathing problems can be treated using a leaf blower.

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.780
 I have to admit, and this is genuinely true,

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.700
 right until you said it tonight, I misread it.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.820
 I thought you said a giraffe with breathing problems

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.460
 can be used as a leaf blower.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.580
 (laughing)

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.180
 Honestly, as you read it tonight,

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.620
 they're the one giraffes that can't be used to blow leaves.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:34.060
 I thought that's what it was,

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.260
 so I looked into other animals

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.820
 that can be used as a leaf blower.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.900
 (laughing)

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.900
 - I think we do need to interrogate for a second

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.460
 how you thought a giraffe was gonna be used as a leaf blower.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.340
 Was it like, when you play wheelbarrow at school in races,

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.540
 you hold its legs, but it's nose to the ground?

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.580
 - Yeah, I turn out, 'cause the only,

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.620
 I thought it was a bit of a cruel fact to use, to be honest.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:57.100
 I was, 'cause I thought they must have this sort of push

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.940
 that with a break in between, 'cause it's like a wheeze,

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.980
 and they probably lean over because it's hurting,

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.420
 so they're going, they're like, wow, this is really effective

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.220
 in zoos, let's walk the giraffe around

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:09.220
 with the breathing problems, and let's clean this place up.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:13.780
 Anyway, so elephants also use their trunks

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.300
 as a makeshift leaf blower, as it were.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.620
 - Don't say all so.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.900
 (laughing)

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.740
 (laughing)

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.420
 - So elephants, they have this thing.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.020
 - Where if they're in vicinity of inaccessible food,

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.500
 because a bit too tight for them to get to the food,

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.540
 what they do is they blow at the food

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.780
 if there's some sort of tree or wall, let's say,

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.500
 that's in the way, and it bounces the food off it

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.140
 and back towards them, and that's how they can get their food.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.300
 And this is something we've been observing about elephants

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.020
 for a very long time, in fact,

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.780
 in the descent of man by Charles Darwin,

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:51.300
 he writes about the leaf blowing that wasn't invented then.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.060
 So, way ahead of his time, Charles Darwin.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.820
 - It's interesting, 'cause it's a bit like them using tools,

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.660
 isn't it, because they've basically solved a problem

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.180
 to be able to get food closer to them,

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.180
 which I think is really cool.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.020
 - Yeah, it's really amazing.

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.300
 - I was looking at a few other weird things

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.780
 that Vets had done, and just this one thing I found,

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.980
 which I really liked, it's not quite that,

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.540
 but there was a spiny antita called Matilda,

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:18.180
 who had inflamed skin, bald patches, and bulging puffy eyes.

00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:21.300
 And it turned out that she was allergic to ants.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.500
 - Wow. - She's an antita allergic to ants.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.420
 And actually, yeah. - Where's your puffy eyes?

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.260
 - Puffy eyes, yeah.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.980
 - They should have just put a live crab.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.420
 (audience laughing)

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:35.580
 Around the neck, problem solved.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.060
 - They made a vaccine for her, that's it.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.900
 - Oh, okay.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.260
 Okay, time for our final fact of the show,

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.580
 and that is Andy.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.180
 My fact is that when 3,000 British teenagers

00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:49.420
 were surveyed in 2008, 20% said that they thought

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.940
 Winston Churchill was a fictional character.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:54.060
 (audience laughing)

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.740
 - They can all vote now, can't they?

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:56.580
 - Yep.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.820
 (audience laughing)

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.220
 So, and this is just sort of, you know,

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.060
 things that gets thrown up by opinion polls,

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.980
 so the same poll found that 27% thought

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.420
 that Florence Nightingale had never existed,

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:12.740
 and the 47% thought that Richard the Lionheart was fictional,

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.740
 which I can kind of understand,

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.260
 'cause that sounds like it. - Yeah, it sounds like it.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.100
 - Sounds like it.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.620
 - Sounds maybe happy, doesn't Richard the Lionheart, yeah, sure.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.820
 But 47% thought that Eleanor Rigby was real.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.100
 - Oh. - So.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.500
 - Well, there wasn't real one, was there?

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.940
 - Yeah, I mean, in a way she was,

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.060
 because Paul McCartney did see the name Eleanor Rigby

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.580
 on a tombstone, he didn't know her, or her story,

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:35.340
 but there was, well, 47% of British teenagers in 2008

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.700
 knew that Beatles arcane anecdote.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.220
 (audience laughing)

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.100
 There was a month later, they did another survey,

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.380
 and one in three primary school pupils thought

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.300
 that he was the first man to walk on the moon

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.980
 when it's the Churchill.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.860
 Cool. - Well, I think a lot of these things,

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.260
 it must be like, they just give you a name of a person,

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.460
 they go, real or not real, and you just go,

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.660
 I don't know. - Yeah.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.500
 - Especially at primary school,

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.500
 you don't care what you're crossing,

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.820
 you're just excited someone's giving you a felt tip.

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:02.060
 (audience laughing)

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.860
 - But so, they, just bringing up moon,

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.140
 it's not as if they think he's fictional,

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.820
 as in it's a conspiracy that he was invented as an idea,

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:09.980
 'cause you know there was all that stuff,

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:12.220
 about the fact that we'll fight them on the beaches,

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.500
 was said by someone else, a voice actor.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.940
 Which is not true, I don't think,

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.300
 but there was an idea that he had never...

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.740
 - It is true, there was a voice actor.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.820
 - Yeah, yeah, it was a voice actor.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.340
 The famous recording that we have,

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.740
 or many of the famous recordings that we have,

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.100
 in fact, of Winston Churchill,

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.060
 I think we're recorded after the war.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.740
 - Churchill himself did a few in a studio,

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.020
 but there are broadcasts which were done by a voice actor.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:32.860
 - Okay, right.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.780
 You know, he has been a fictional character

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:35.980
 in some respects. - Okay, yes.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.620
 - I went on to Comic Thine website,

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.540
 and found that there's 164 comic books

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.420
 with Winston Churchill as a character in them.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.260
 - Wow.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.900
 - He's been in Star Trek, Comic, Eagle, Justice League,

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.740
 Super Buy, Captain America, Green Lantern,

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.140
 and Santa Claus versus the Nazis.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.460
 (audience laughing)

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:54.780
 - Wow.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:55.780
 They're the main ones.

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.740
 - He wasn't very good in studies.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.500
 I mean, I know there's a thing that's often said about Churchill,

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.180
 but I do think it's quite reassuring

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.620
 when you realize how bad he was at school.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:05.860
 - So he failed basically everything

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.780
 that he didn't like except history in English.

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.380
 He failed his entrance exam to university twice

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.860
 or to the Royal Military College,

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.420
 which I don't think was that hard to get into.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.700
 But he failed that twice.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.780
 - Well, he failed everything except history in English.

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.500
 - Oh, he did very badly in it.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.740
 Yeah. - Okay, but history in English

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.740
 was two best ones.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:22.580
 - I think so, yeah.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.420
 - And then later on, he won the Nobel Prize for Literature

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.740
 and defeated Nazis, history, and English.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.900
 (audience laughing)

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.900
 - So what we're saying, kids, is specialize.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:32.740
 - Yeah.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.580
 (audience laughing)

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.660
 - If you know good at French, fuck it.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.660
 (audience laughing)

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.660
 (audience laughing)

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.860
 - Is that what we're saying?

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.380
 (audience laughing)

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:49.620
 - How do we are that divided a country after all?

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.700
 - You're in Roosevelt, FDR, I first met him.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.500
 He first met him in 1918.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.580
 So I would have been just after he'd come out

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:56.980
 from fighting the First World War

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.420
 and they were on a diplomatic mission

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.580
 and he met Churchill as a soldier

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:03.060
 and called him a stinker, hated him.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.220
 - So they obviously became really close

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.860
 in the Second World War, but the only thing he said

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.460
 about what it's in Churchill was, what a stinker.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.900
 - What does stinker mean in that?

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.740
 Does it mean just a bad person or like actually smirk?

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:13.980
 - It means a stinker. - Oh really?

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.060
 - What is, you're a stinker, you know,

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.740
 like in a playground, if you call someone a stinker,

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.900
 then-- - I know, not only too well.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.900
 (audience laughing)

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.740
 Oh.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.180
 (audience laughing)

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:29.300
 So Churchill first became famous in the Boer War

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.340
 as a reporter, didn't he?

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.940
 But then as a correspondent, he got captured

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:36.620
 and he had to escape and then the tales of his escape

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.380
 became really, really famous.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.580
 But when he did escape, they raised the alarm

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.340
 and they gave a description of him

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.580
 so they could find him.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.460
 And they said, "Escape to Prisoner of War,

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:49.220
 Winston Spencer Churchill, Englishman, 25 years old,

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:52.420
 "about five foot eight inches tall, medium build,

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.460
 "walks with a slight stoop, pale features,

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:59.380
 "reddish brown hair, almost invisible, small mustache,

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:03.540
 "speaks through his nose, cannot pronounce the letter S,

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.020
 "and cannot speak one word of Dutch."

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:08.460
 - Oh, wow. - And that's your great Winston Churchill.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.460
 - Oh. - Yeah?

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.100
 - Almost invisible, small mustache.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.820
 Wait, you there, stop.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.260
 No, that's too visible, a small mustache.

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.100
 You're free to go.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.700
 (audience laughing)

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.660
 - That was Hitler, wasn't it, in that respect?

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.660
 (audience laughing)

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.500
 - Can I tell you just a really quick Churchill thing,

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.940
 there's quite tangentially related,

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.660
 but this was actually one of our researchers

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.500
 sent me the book with us in the other day.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.500
 And it's that Winston Churchill had a son-in-law,

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.060
 Duncan Sandis, who was a minister for a brief time in the '60s.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.740
 And basically, Winston Churchill's son-in-law was forced

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:47.460
 by Harold McMillan's government to go to the doctor

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:51.580
 to have his penis compared to a penis in a salacious photo

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.820
 to prove that it wasn't the same penis.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.380
 And it's just such a good story.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.820
 So there was this huge ruckus in the early '60s

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.900
 because someone was caught having a blowjob

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.620
 given to them by a Dutchess.

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:04.220
 And their head wasn't in the picture.

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.500
 So you can only see the other regions.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.540
 And it was gonna be this huge scandal.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:09.900
 And everyone said it's this guy.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.860
 It's the minister of defense, Duncan Sandis.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.620
 And so he eventually had to go,

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.100
 he was made to go to Harley Street by the government

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.860
 with this photo in one hand and this willy in the other.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.900
 (audience laughing)

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.460
 - How did he ring the bell?

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.460
 (audience laughing)

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:28.460
 (audience laughing)

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:33.700
 - Anyway, they confirmed it wasn't the same penis.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.540
 - Wow.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.980
 - We should talk as well about surveys

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:40.780
 'cause surveys, they always bring up the weirdest

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.500
 of revelations about what people think around the world.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.220
 I really like that.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.300
 There was a survey done about what we think sci-fi things

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.380
 are real and not real that we hear about.

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.620
 So, for example, over a fifth of adults,

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.780
 and this was in Birmingham, did this as a survey.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.420
 Over a fifth of adults incorrectly believe

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.220
 that lightsabers exist as a real thing.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:05.780
 Nearly a quarter, 24% of people believe

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.620
 that humans can be teleporters.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.660
 (audience laughing)

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:09.660
 That's quite cool.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.060
 40% believe that hoverboards exist.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:12.900
 I mean, it's a--

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.300
 - I think they didn't invent a hoverboard.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.660
 'Cause I thought they invented the world's first hoverboard

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:17.500
 a couple of years ago.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.020
 - They also had those really rubbish

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.180
 kind of things on two wheels that like a segway

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.220
 without the stick and they were called hoverboards.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.580
 Maybe I'm thinking of that.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.260
 They didn't invent one.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.820
 I think it might have been a bit rubbish.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.380
 - 11% of teenagers think that fruit pastels

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:31.860
 count as one of your five a day.

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.860
 - Which color?

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:34.700
 - Any color?

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.540
 - Any color.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.540
 - They're all fruit.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.540
 - They're all fruit.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.380
 - Well, fruit and meat pastels, are they?

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.180
 (audience laughing)

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.380
 Although I've just had an amazing idea.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:47.380
 (audience laughing)

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:51.660
 - Well, 11.5 tubes of fruit pastels

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:54.700
 would give you about as much vitamin C as a piece of fruit.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:58.620
 - So Yugav do obviously loads and loads and loads of pulse

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:00.740
 and they build up these huge, you know,

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.140
 crunching amounts of data based on, you know,

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.460
 just they pick one thing that people divide into

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.900
 like right-handed or left-handed

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:08.380
 and then they can find out massive amounts

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.860
 about the tendencies.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.740
 So Yugav surveys have found,

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.580
 and they've sort of crunched the loaded numbers together,

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:16.620
 that a quarter of leave voters like their stakes well done

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:20.260
 but only 12% of remain voters like their stakes well done.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.540
 More leave voters than remain voters

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.060
 think that Doctor Who votes conservative.

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:26.380
 (audience laughing)

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.820
 - Remain voters think you would probably vote green.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.260
 (audience laughing)

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.420
 - She.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.260
 - Oh.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.660
 (audience laughing)

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:36.660
 - Well thanks a bunch, Shoez, I've got up to Chris Ackelston.

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.660
 (audience laughing)

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:45.900
 - Well, get ready to be angry.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.540
 (audience laughing)

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.980
 - Um, I found this amazing.

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.420
 There was a survey done last year

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:58.300
 that found 35% of French people cannot name

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.380
 the French Prime Minister.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:01.220
 - What?

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.420
 - Which, I mean, can you?

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:03.260
 - No.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.100
 (audience laughing)

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:04.940
 - The French Prime Minister.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:06.260
 - Who the President is Macron?

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.260
 - Yes, indeed.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.380
 - Does that get, is that what the half point?

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.180
 - You don't get bonus points for naming that cross.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.020
 - This is the worst pub quiz I've ever been to.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:14.340
 (audience laughing)

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.300
 - So who is it?

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.820
 - It's a guy called Edward Philippe.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:17.900
 - I have to say I'd never heard of it.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:18.740
 - I could have guessed that.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.340
 I would have said two random French names.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:21.340
 It got pretty close.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.940
 (audience laughing)

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.620
 - He's not incredible more than a third.

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.220
 I don't know that own Prime Minister is.

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.580
 Apparently on the survey a lot of people put Gerard Philippe

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.980
 or I think it's an actor or Louis Philippe,

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.580
 who's obviously, you know, early French king.

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.500
 But yeah, they don't know that PM.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.420
 And I think probably Britain might be

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.140
 in the same position at this stage, but yeah.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:43.020
 - By the time this goes out next week.

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:44.260
 (audience laughing)

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.900
 - There was a survey done in America about the cloud

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.940
 or cloud computing putting up in the clouds.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.780
 And 51% of the Americans answered to the survey

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.780
 I said that they thought that if it was a stormy

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.020
 weather situation outside, that would affect them

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.780
 getting access to their cloud information.

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.780
 It's fair enough.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.380
 - There was a tech poll a few years ago where 11% of people

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.060
 believe that HTML was a sexually transmitted disease.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.180
 (audience laughing)

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:13.220
 - So that was a survey, a study that was looking

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.940
 into how many people understood techy sounding words.

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.100
 So as well as that.

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.060
 - How many people thought that JPEG was a character

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:19.900
 in the Bible?

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.900
 (audience laughing)

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:29.580
 - So as well as HTML is sexually transmitted disease,

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:33.180
 they found that 27% of the people doing it

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.700
 thought Gigabyte was an insect commonly found

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.900
 in South America.

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:37.980
 (audience laughing)

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.620
 18% thought Blu-ray was a marine animal.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:45.620
 And 23% thought MP3 was a Star Wars robot.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:48.260
 (audience laughing)

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.700
 - To be fair, in five years time,

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.180
 no one's gonna know what an MP3 is,

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:53.180
 and almost no one knows what a Blu-ray was.

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:54.940
 So they were just ahead of their time.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.460
 - Oh, thanks, I'll just put all of Doctor Who on Blu-ray.

00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.820
 (audience laughing)

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.060
 - All right guys, we need to wrap up.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.220
 Okay, that is it.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.300
 That is all of our facts.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.860
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.660
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.380

 of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.100

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.260

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:23.780
 No such thing as a fish, or our website.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:25.020
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.380
 We got everything up there from upcoming tour dates

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:30.140
 to our book, a link to buy it to everything.

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:31.700
 It's got all the previous episodes.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:34.580
 And before we wrap up, we're gonna very quickly read out

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.420
 the winner of tonight's prequel book.

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:38.420
 - Wow.

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:39.420
 (audience laughing)

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.060
 - So James, you've picked a winner.

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:44.620
 - Yes, so this fact is from Becky,

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.940
 whose friend Chris Lemon has a birthday today.

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:48.940
 And it is. - Happy birthday.

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:49.780
 - Happy birthday, Chris.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.620
 If you're here.

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:51.460
 - Thank you.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.660
 (audience laughing)

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.500
 - Well, Becky's fact is that in 1974,

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.140
 a research scientist, Dr. Sommelin,

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:02.860
 announced that he had successfully transplanted skin

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:05.540
 from a black mouse onto a white mouse.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.580
 It was later discovered that he had actually

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.980
 coloured the white mouse in with a black pen.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.980
 (audience laughing)

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:18.740
 That's an amazing fact.

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.340
 Okay, guys, we're gonna be outside

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.220
 signing these books if you want one.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.380
 Thank you so much for being here.

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.460
 We really appreciate it.

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.660
 We'll be back again next week.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.180
 Goodbye.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:30.180
 (audience cheering)

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.760
 (upbeat music)

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.760
 (audience clapping)

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.340
 (upbeat music)
