00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
 (electronic music)

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,080
 (electronic music)

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,920
 (electronic music)

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:22,040
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,160
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,000
 This week coming to you live from our book of the year,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,160
 2018 Tour in Norenga!

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,660
 (cheering)

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:38,840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,040
 I am sitting here with Anichezinski,

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,240
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and Jane Tarkin.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,700
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,000
 and in no particular order, here we go.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,160
 Starting with you, Anichezinski.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,600
 - Yes, my fact this week is that old European malaria remedies

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,480
 included throwing the patient headfirst into a bush

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,120
 in the hope that he'd get out quickly enough

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,840
 to leave the fever behind.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,600
 (laughing)

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,280
 Yeah, just got tangled up in there, can't get out,

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,880
 and you scarper, that was how you did it.

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,240
 And this was used all the way up until the 17th century,

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,720
 basically until the 1600s, no one knew how to cure malaria.

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,080
 And so they just made up a lot of wacky shit.

27
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,320
 And I wonder what they thought happened to the malaria in the bush?

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,800
 Did it stay there, like if you went through a walk through the bush?

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,920
 - Yeah, it is a cup.

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,800
 - It is a bit like that, so it's called passing through.

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,560
 And it's kind of an old folklore thing.

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,360
 They did it for lots of different diseases.

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,040
 Sometimes it would be a hole in a tree or a hole in a stone

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,160
 or something like that, and you would pass through the hole.

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,520
 And the idea is you would leave the disease behind you.

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,400
 And actually it happened in America,

37
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,160
 they didn't, perhaps they didn't have trees or stones,

38
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,200
 but they used to climb under the belly of a donkey.

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,800
 And the idea is you would leave your disease behind.

40
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,960
 - And is it that it gets so distracted by the inside of the tree

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,320
 or the belly of the donkey that it goes,

42
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,400
 "Oh, look, and it loses sight of it."

43
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
 - I don't think so.

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,760
 - I don't think they really knew what was going on with it.

45
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,120
 - Yeah, malaria is not like me,

46
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,920
 just distracted by any idiotic thing.

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,720
 Ooh, what's wrong with it?

48
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,840
 - But yeah, so of course the, as soon as the tree

49
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,360
 that has quinine in it was discovered suddenly,

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,640
 everyone could be cured of malaria.

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,920
 And that was in, well, this is by Western Europeans,

52
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,240
 it was discovered in the 17th century.

53
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,400
 So they went over to Peru,

54
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,400
 and they found the indigenous people were just using the bark

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,280
 from this tree called the canchona tree.

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,440
 You know, that's how you pronounce it.

57
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,080
 And that just cures it.

58
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
 And so they started using it,

59
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,440
 and then all their problems were over,

60
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,560
 no more running in and out of bushes.

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,240
 - Yeah, it was a tough time up until then.

62
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,720
 - It was, 'cause there's quite a few other things

63
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,440
 they tried as well as the bush thing, wasn't it?

64
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,200
 It wasn't just the bush thing.

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,960
 So eating an onion with the word armen on it.

66
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,240
 - With the word armen?

67
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
 - Armen.

68
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,560
 - Was this for malaria to get rid of them?

69
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,400
 - Yeah, the armen.

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,720
 - Well, it didn't work either.

71
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,240
 - But you can't, I mean, very few anions have the word armen on them.

72
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,360
 - So if you can find one of those,

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,600
 I think you deserve to be cured.

74
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,320
 - Yeah, you were allowed to write it on yourself.

75
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,840
 - Oh, fine.

76
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,200
 - Smirring cow manure on your body,

77
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,760
 drinking opium-laced beer,

78
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,280
 that was quite a good one, actually.

79
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,320
 There was a guy called Alberta's Magnus,

80
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,320
 he was the Dominican scholar,

81
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,880
 and he said, allowing insects to devour

82
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,080
 77 small cakes made from a dough

83
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,840
 prepared by mixing flour and the patient's urine.

84
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,400
 - Right.

85
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,720
 - Just on the beer one that you said,

86
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,520
 well, no, no, no.

87
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,600
 - Don't you kind of glossed over a slightly more?

88
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,920
 - A 77, allowing the flies to eat 77 small cakes.

89
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,440
 - Can't be any insects.

90
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,160
 - Oh, fine, okay.

91
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,280
 Do you have to open a tiny gregs for them,

92
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,160
 which says we have urine cakes inside?

93
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,920
 - Can I just say for the people at gregs,

94
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,560
 I'm sure you don't sell urine cakes, I've never...

95
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,080
 They're never sponsoring us chains, we could say what we like.

96
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,800
 (laughing)

97
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,760
 - Actually, Kate Guy was a guy called Alberta's Magnus,

98
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,080
 wasn't it, who was, this guy in the 13th century

99
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,640
 who came with loads of wacky cures,

100
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,840
 and another one of his familiaria was that

101
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,960
 you could cut a chip off a block

102
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,440
 that a criminal had been executed on,

103
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,000
 and then rub it all over your body

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,760
 if you were suffering from it.

105
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
 And that scared off the malaria,

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,080
 'cause it reminded it of the penalty for being evil.

107
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,200
 Reminded the evil malaria,

108
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,400
 that maybe it'll be hanged one day

109
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,480
 if it doesn't go away.

110
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,720
 - And that's where we get the phrase,

111
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,600
 a chip off the old block on which a criminal was executed.

112
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,400
 - It is, exactly, yes.

113
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
 - I've got a real cure for malaria.

114
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
 - Okay.

115
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,120
 - Viagra, can fight malaria.

116
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,440
 Did you know this? - Yeah.

117
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,080
 - So, okay, the malaria parasite, it gets into your body

118
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,640
 and it goes into red blood cells for a while.

119
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,560
 It spends a while in there in your bone marrow,

120
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,720
 and the spleen's job is to filter out, you know,

121
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,120
 old or dead or stiff red blood cells,

122
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,200
 and so the malaria normally sneakily passes through.

123
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,920
 However, and that means it spreads through the blood.

124
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,480
 However, if a patient takes Viagra,

125
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,440
 the infected blood cells themselves stiffen up.

126
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,440
 (audience laughing)

127
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,200
 - It literally makes your blood cells go stiff.

128
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,520
 - Yes, I know that, that, that, that, that, that.

129
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,560
 - I knew that it made other things go stiff.

130
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,520
 I just didn't know that it made the actual blood cells

131
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,360
 in your body go stiff.

132
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,200
 - I think it's true.

133
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,680
 - If you dilute Viagra and put it in a plant part,

134
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,040
 it makes a plant go stiff.

135
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,720
 - Get away.

136
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,520
 - I didn't know individual cells

137
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,120
 getting individual little erections.

138
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,640
 - Exactly.

139
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,360
 But it does, it will present the mosquitoes

140
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,680
 with a big target as well to go through.

141
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,320
 - How come when you eat Viagra then,

142
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,840
 it doesn't make a tongue stiff?

143
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,360
 (audience laughing)

144
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,480
 - I think that, no, in fairness, that's quite a good point.

145
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,760
 - That's a great point.

146
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,040
 - How come, basically, anyone who's taken Viagra

147
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,120
 the whole body just isn't completely stiff?

148
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,920
 (audience laughing)

149
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,760
 - I don't know.

150
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,360
 - Well, he gave it as a starfish.

151
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,200
 - All right.

152
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,360
 - I'm ready.

153
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,720
 (audience laughing)

154
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,680
 - But starfish have got five limbs

155
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,160
 and you've only got, oh no, yeah.

156
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,160
 (audience laughing)

157
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,480
 (audience applauding)

158
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,360
 Anyway.

159
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,920
 Dr Butler, there was a famous doctor called Dr Butler,

160
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,720
 and his way of treating malaria was by dropping people

161
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,440
 through a trap door on London Bridge

162
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,160
 into the polluted river Thames.

163
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,520
 - There used to be a trap door in London Bridge.

164
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,880
 (audience laughing)

165
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,560
 - I mean, that's, I didn't think of that,

166
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,720
 but yeah, that is where, isn't it?

167
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,880
 - Wow.

168
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,360
 - So would he have to lure them onto the trap door?

169
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,160
 - Would they know they're gonna be dropped

170
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,400
 through the trap door?

171
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,120
 Or does he say, pay me the money?

172
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,040
 And I'll show you where the cure is.

173
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,280
 (audience laughing)

174
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,120
 It's just over here.

175
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
 - I think, it's a really good question.

176
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,960
 I really don't know.

177
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,040
 'Cause this guy wasn't great.

178
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,720
 He had a habit of treating epilepsy

179
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,920
 by firing a gun beside the victim's head.

180
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,520
 (audience laughing)

181
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,360
 - He was the physician to James I.

182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,680
 So he was like, you know, he's a real deal.

183
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,600
 Well, no, he wasn't the real deal, but, you know.

184
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,880
 - But you said that like, James I first

185
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,600
 who famously lived for 700 years,

186
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,720
 like, how did he die?

187
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,800
 26, malaria.

188
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
 (audience laughing)

189
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,920
 Hey, do you know the oldest example of malaria

190
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,200
 that we found in a human that we have now?

191
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,040
 - No.

192
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,600
 - It's Tutankhamun.

193
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,440
 - Is it?

194
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,880
 - Yeah, they've recently discovered a few years ago now

195
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,680
 that Tutankhamun actually has types of,

196
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,760
 not even one type, a few types of malaria inside him.

197
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,120
 And that would have contributed

198
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,680
 to his immune system going down.

199
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,440
 So they don't think it's what killed him,

200
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,720
 but they think it's what, you know, added to his problems

201
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,560
 of his feet being bad and whatever it was.

202
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,680
 We don't actually know what killed him.

203
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,440
 I think he was possibly crushed by a hippo,

204
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,040
 but it's possible that the malaria

205
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,720
 and not back the reflexes, it's possible.

206
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,240
 - It's not possible.

207
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,320
 - Everything's possible, you know, maybe in the sarcophagus,

208
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,520
 he was very, very flat.

209
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,800
 (audience laughing)

210
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,120
 - He also had syphilis, didn't he?

211
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,400
 He had everything Tutankhamun.

212
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,680
 He was the first, he had the first socks and sandals,

213
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,880
 I think, in the world.

214
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,520
 He just, always on it.

215
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,320
 In fact, malaria can cure syphilis.

216
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,240
 So maybe he had malaria to cure his syphilis.

217
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,080
 - That's possible.

218
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,000
 - So this is a genuine thing.

219
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,560
 Yeah, someone won the Nobel Prize for this in,

220
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,080
 this was in 1917 that it was discovered,

221
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,240
 and it was an Austrian physician called Julius Wagner-Jorreg.

222
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,880
 And he realized that the fever that could be induced

223
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,960
 by malaria was hot enough to cure syphilis.

224
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,640
 And so yeah, he got the Nobel Prize

225
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,920
 and that was used until 1940, if you had syphilis,

226
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,680
 then you would be infected deliberately with malaria.

227
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,520
 - And don't worry, we've got some gonorrhea for the malaria.

228
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,760
 (audience laughing)

229
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,280
 And then we've got some dengue fever for the gonorrhea.

230
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,600
 It's like the old woman who swallowed a fly.

231
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,680
 (audience laughing)

232
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,200
 That was infected with malaria.

233
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,920
 (audience laughing)

234
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,440
 - There's a town, a city in fact in Australia

235
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,440
 called Townsville and 7,000 families there

236
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,640
 have been nannying mosquitoes recently.

237
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,480
 - This is what we mean by that.

238
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,320
 - Within the last year or two.

239
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,880
 So they've all hosted a tub of mosquito eggs

240
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,440
 in their backyard, and they've watered them

241
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,000
 and kept them nice and cool and moist and nurtured them.

242
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,760
 Because those mosquitoes have all been infected

243
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,160
 with a bacteria, which means they're less able

244
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,440
 to transmit dengue and Zika viruses.

245
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,880
 And they're the ones where you're gonna try

246
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,280
 and get them to mate with the other mosquitoes.

247
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,120
 - Exactly.

248
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,960
 - Yeah.

249
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,040
 - So they're breeding millions and millions,

250
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,720
 and everyone in the town has agreed to it.

251
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,960
 They said, yeah, great, bring on the good mosquitoes.

252
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,800
 - That is good.

253
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,640
 - Yeah.

254
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,480
 - It's a rubbish pet.

255
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,640
 If you ask for a dog, you've got 1,000 mosquitoes.

256
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,480
 You're really pissed off.

257
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,760
 - And it's wrapped up under the tree in the shape of a dog,

258
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,080
 but in fact, 2,000 mosquitoes.

259
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,760
 - I mean, you're never gonna wrap a dog are you?

260
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,840
 (laughing)

261
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,280
 - Well, people are trying to find malaria vaccines still.

262
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,480
 And it seems to be habit to infect yourself

263
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,880
 with malaria to work out what works.

264
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,040
 But also in the past, people infected other people.

265
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,280
 So, we often talk about self-experimentation

266
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,920
 and it's kind of these heroes who poison themselves

267
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,120
 so they can work out how to cure themselves.

268
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,480
 But there was a guy called Dr. Gracie in 1898

269
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,200
 who really wanted to work out,

270
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,440
 who really wanted to prove that malaria was caused

271
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,920
 by the Anophilese Mosquito, which it is.

272
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,440
 And no one would believe him.

273
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,640
 And so he got a volunteer called Mr. Solar

274
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,040
 to be locked in a room in a tiny box

275
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,560
 for 11 days filled with malaria infected mosquitoes

276
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,480
 until he got one of the 11 days.

277
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,640
 - Yeah, it took, yeah.

278
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,800
 I mean, oh wow.

279
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
 - And the sad thing is we know that he got malaria

280
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,680
 because it was a successful experiment.

281
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,440
 So this guy, Dr. Gracie, was thrilled.

282
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,160
 He was like, now I've proven that the Mosquito cures malaria.

283
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,000
 And in his case notes, he writes,

284
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,840
 "The rest of the history of Mr. Solar's case

285
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,760
 "has no interest for us, but it is now certain

286
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,360
 "that mosquitoes carry malaria."

287
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,120
 So, oh my God. - Did not care, yeah.

288
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,960
 - Wow.

289
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,520
 I was looking into the idea of all these old, you know,

290
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,160
 suggestions for how you cure things.

291
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,120
 So outside of malaria, there's everyone,

292
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,720
 every single disease seemed to have an eccentric thing

293
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,600
 assigned to it.

294
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,200
 And one of my favorite ones is if you had swollen eyes,

295
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,560
 the way that they suggested,

296
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,400
 Dr. Suggested, that you cure it,

297
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,400
 was that you tied a live crab to a necklace on your chest,

298
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,360
 and you just let it live there.

299
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,920
 And no, I mean, nobody will notice your swollen eyes

300
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,760
 ever again.

301
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,800
 (laughing)

302
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,840
 - You just tie it around your neck

303
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,320
 and you just have a live crab and that will cure it.

304
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,600
 - Cool.

305
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,160
 I didn't know swollen eyes was really a thing.

306
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,000
 I was like, around the ear, so it's not swollen at all.

307
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,920
 - It's thanks to the crap cure that was so successful.

308
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,360
 That's why everyone's got normal eyes.

309
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,840
 - We wiped it out, yeah.

310
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,840
 (laughing)

311
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,480
 - I was just saying before about these mosquitoes

312
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,440
 in town, they're gonna send them out to have sex

313
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,560
 with other mosquitoes.

314
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,760
 And I looked into how mosquitoes have sex.

315
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,040
 And one interesting thing I found is,

316
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,360
 it's the females that bite you.

317
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,920
 And so what some male mosquitoes will do,

318
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,320
 is they'll find a human and then just hang around the human

319
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,200
 waiting for females to come.

320
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,040
 - Wow.

321
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,600
 - So like the human is just like a singles bar or something.

322
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,120
 (laughing)

323
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,960
 - That's so cool.

324
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,920
 - So you might just have a little mosquito flying around

325
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,720
 and you're like, "Oh God, say, can he's just waiting

326
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,520
 for a bit of Lady Mosquito."

327
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,840
 - Wow.

328
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,160
 - It's quite risky then landing on you though.

329
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,240
 Going to that bar is a risky affair.

330
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,080
 'Cause I didn't realize.

331
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
 - That's the dating scene.

332
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,720
 (laughing)

333
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,360
 - Oh, you gotta put yourself out there.

334
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,480
 And they do.

335
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,840
 But the reason they suck our blood is to feed their eggs.

336
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,680
 So that's why it's only the females.

337
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,560
 But they, as soon as they've sucked it,

338
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,360
 they're so full they can't move anymore.

339
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,080
 So every time a mosquito is sucking on your blood,

340
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,160
 it's risking its own life.

341
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,680
 'Cause if you spot it and spot it in time

342
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,120
 and that's why you often can,

343
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,280
 it can't really fly away.

344
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,640
 It's got this giant sack of blood now inside it.

345
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,480
 - Wow.

346
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,120
 - It's actually really worse for them than it is for you.

347
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,480
 - We're gonna have to move on in a second.

348
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,160
 Or an X-Fact.

349
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,720
 Do you wanna say something Andy or no?

350
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,880
 - It's just a follow-on fact from that, really.

351
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,960
 But it's not relevant enough to end this,

352
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,800
 to end the second.

353
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,640
 - No, no, no.

354
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,000
 - Well, man, bring it home.

355
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,840
 - Oh God.

356
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,120
 It's not good, it's not good.

357
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,520
 It's just that Mosquitoes are victims as much as we are

358
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,280
 because they're carrying the malaria parasite,

359
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,080
 but there's a theory that Mosquitoes

360
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,600
 are actually made a bit crazy

361
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,400
 by having the parasite inside them

362
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,240
 and it makes them extra keen to suck blood.

363
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,400
 So they would do it anyway,

364
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,080
 but the parasite makes them basically like vampire mosquitoes.

365
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,760
 - And the other thing is they get sick.

366
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,640
 Mosquitoes get sick, so it's a bit harsh on them.

367
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,120
 If they've got this malaria parasite there sick,

368
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,080
 and also we blame them for kind of spreading it,

369
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,880
 but Mosquitoes don't get on airplanes

370
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,520
 and fly around and stuff like that.

371
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,160
 Mosquitoes stay near that little place where they live.

372
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,440
 What happens is humans get bitten, humans go somewhere else,

373
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,840
 and they get bitten again and make a poor Mosquito sick,

374
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,200
 and then that Mosquito gets loads of other people sick.

375
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,360
 So it's the humans who are doing all the spreading around.

376
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,960
 The poor Mosquitoes are just flying around,

377
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,480
 getting sick and then getting squashed.

378
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,720
 - Oh.

379
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,080
 - The real enemy is man.

380
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,440
 (laughing)

381
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,920
 (upbeat music)

382
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,360
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

383
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,880
 and that is my fact.

384
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,560
 My fact this week is that,

385
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,760
 instead of commissioning new wax works

386
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,080
 for their exhibitions,

387
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,600
 the Bible Walk Museum in Ohio

388
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,680
 repurposes discarded wax works from around the world instead.

389
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,960
 As a result, Abel is played by Prince Charles.

390
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
 (audience laughing)

391
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,040
 King Solomon is played by John Travolta,

392
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,720
 and Jesus is played by Tom Cruise.

393
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,160
 (audience laughing)

394
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,960
 And I encourage you to go online and look at these photos,

395
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,160
 'cause Tom Cruise makes a good-looking Jesus.

396
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,400
 (laughing)

397
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,680
 - It is in baby Jesus, like Nativity scene.

398
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,960
 (laughing)

399
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,880
 It is manger, and then you pull as little rug down,

400
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,240
 and it's Tom Cruise's face, baby.

401
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,520
 - Yeah, it's Tom Cruise with the help it's ordered.

402
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,360
 - Yeah.

403
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,200
 - Like a mission impossible,

404
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,040
 the way he always pulls off the rubber mask,

405
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,760
 and it's Tom Cruise underneath.

406
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,560
 You thought I was the baby Jesus?

407
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,680
 Well, you were wrong.

408
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,640
 You're a really good boy.

409
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,800
 Yeah, so this is a very almost famous in American museum.

410
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,720
 The Bible Walk Museum, it was started

411
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,640
 by Pastor Richard Diamond in 1983.

412
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,080
 He was inspired after he visited another wax museum.

413
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,120
 Not the greatest origin story, sort of expected or best.

414
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,560
 And he wanted to do it and tell the story of the Bible,

415
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,680
 but he realized how expensive it was to make new wax works.

416
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,200
 So he thought there's a lot that are closing down all the time.

417
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,360
 There's a lot that are selling them off at auction.

418
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,480
 Let's just buy these.

419
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,600
 And they tend to be celebrities, so yeah.

420
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,720
 - That's the thing, like no one knows what Abel looked like.

421
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,560
 Do they?

422
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,200
 He might look like Prince Charles, I don't know.

423
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,040
 - Yeah, that's true.

424
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,160
 They gave Prince Charles, when you see that photo,

425
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,880
 a sort of putting bowl haircut.

426
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,000
 So they mess with the hair.

427
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,440
 They don't leave the head untouched.

428
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,720
 They still dress them up, and they, yeah.

429
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,560
 And it looks really good.

430
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,080
 And Steve McQueen is there, and George Harrison is there.

431
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,680
 And Marlon Brando, and Bert Lancaster, and Clark Gable.

432
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,520
 It's, yeah.

433
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
 - That's an unbelievably cool selection of people.

434
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,360
 You just listed.

435
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,080
 - You might be open with Prince Charles,

436
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,520
 and you've got your Clark Gables and your Steve McQueens.

437
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,720
 Are they all the wise men?

438
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,400
 - No, they're all just random bit parts.

439
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,720
 There's no, they've got no starring roles.

440
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,600
 Surely Jesus is a starring role

441
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,000
 at a Biblically themed walkthrough wax work museum.

442
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,160
 - There are also, there are quite a few Jesuses in there,

443
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,560
 because it's all of Jesus' life and stuff like that.

444
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,640
 So at one stage, Prince Philip is being resurrected.

445
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,120
 - Prince Philip, yeah.

446
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,960
 - They've got the age of Jesus at resurrection wrong,

447
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,240
 I think that's directly, so do people not mind that?

448
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,800
 - No, they actively love it.

449
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,200
 And that's the problem that the Biblically walked museum has

450
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,880
 is that they don't like people liking that.

451
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,040
 They think it takes away from the story of Jesus.

452
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,720
 So, if you call up, if anyone wants to visit them,

453
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,840
 don't call up and say, hey, can you give us the celebrity

454
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,800
 tour, they will not let you into the museum.

455
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,040
 They actively say, you're not coming now.

456
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,200
 - Really?

457
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,040
 - I think so.

458
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,360
 (audience laughs)

459
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,960
 I'm pretty sure I read that, but they don't encourage that at all.

460
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,400
 And they do think it takes away.

461
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,600
 - I think they've got to make up their minds.

462
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,160
 Either be so stingy, you're going to repurpose

463
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,000
 tacky old wax works for your museum or fork out

464
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,760
 and don't complain about, you know?

465
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,360
 I think if you're going to do it, embrace it.

466
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,240
 Like they did, in fact, so Madame Two Swords

467
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,840
 did an activity thing in 2004,

468
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,800
 and they deliberately put loads of their

469
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,480
 Madame Two Swords icons in the Nativity.

470
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,720
 And so it had the three wise men,

471
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,600
 were Tony Blair, the Duke of Edinburgh,

472
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,560
 again, and George Bush.

473
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,040
 So this is all relevant to people.

474
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,640
 It was an ironic thing, I think.

475
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,520
 Joseph and Mary were posh and becks.

476
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,360
 - Oh.

477
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,760
 - But this was really unpopular.

478
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
 - Yeah, it's going to say, did the Catholics

479
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,480
 and Christians not like that very much at that time?

480
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,800
 - They did not like it at all.

481
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,640
 No, the Vatican spokesman in Britain said

482
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,920
 it was really disrespectful to Christianity.

483
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,440
 And the exhibition actually closed before Christmas

484
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,000
 because someone got in, so cute, got their ticket,

485
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,760
 then went straight up to Joseph and Mary

486
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,880
 and punched them in their face.

487
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,720
 - Oh.

488
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,040
 - Yeah.

489
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,880
 - Wow.

490
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,480
 Do you know, just speaking of Madame Two Swords,

491
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,160
 do you know what the wax work Tom Daly,

492
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,520
 the diver, has that most other wax works.

493
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,880
 So anatomically, what he has that most other wax works don't have.

494
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,040
 - Well, he's very strong.

495
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,480
 Is he, does he have a six pack?

496
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,960
 - I'm sure he does.

497
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,800
 - Yeah.

498
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,640
 - But so does Prince Philip.

499
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,480
 So that's not.

500
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,200
 (laughing)

501
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,000
 - I'm just trying to not go for the obvious.

502
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,880
 - Does he have a lunch pack?

503
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,080
 - No, no, he doesn't.

504
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,320
 - Such a box, I think, is what it's called.

505
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
 Are you sure?

506
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,560
 - I'm pretty sure, yeah, yeah.

507
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,400
 - You confused me.

508
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,920
 I thought you actually meant someone packed it.

509
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,760
 - I'm sure.

510
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,800
 - I don't think he doesn't have a pack lunch.

511
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,200
 - No, it's feet.

512
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,400
 He has feet.

513
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,520
 What, the others don't have feet?

514
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
 - Most wax works just have the shoes

515
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,080
 and they have a very good sort of metal inside,

516
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,840
 almost like what you put a shoe horn into a shoe.

517
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,280
 So yeah, Donald Trump's wax work, for example,

518
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,880
 definitely no feet, it's just his shoes.

519
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,760
 - Most of them, I think, you can get by

520
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,640
 just with head and hands.

521
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,880
 So after they've finished with,

522
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,560
 so for example, what happened to David Cameron

523
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,760
 after he stopped being Prime Minister

524
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,560
 was his Madame Tussauds' wax work

525
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,880
 was decapitated and had his hands chopped off

526
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,000
 and they were kept in storage 'cause they, oh!

527
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,080
 (audience laughing)

528
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,320
 Some applause.

529
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,600
 I don't think we're in that divided country yet.

530
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
 (audience laughing)

531
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,480
 So they never, they think is they never melt anyone down.

532
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,180
 They never melt down a head or hands

533
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,620
 'cause those are the most difficult fiddly

534
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,060
 and the most personal bits to do.

535
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,180
 - Yeah, so it's kind of cheating.

536
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,340
 They're not making wax models,

537
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,980
 they're just making wax hands and a head.

538
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,820
 - Or wax hands.

539
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,620
 - There's an amazing book about Madame Tussauds,

540
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,180
 which is by Pamela Pillbeam and I read a bit of it.

541
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,580
 In the 19th century, Madame Tussauds had a life orchestra

542
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,220
 playing as you walked around

543
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,220
 and it was a really classy thing to do.

544
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,340
 You could touch anyone you liked, I'm pretty good.

545
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,580
 But do you mean the models?

546
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,380
 'Cause it's gonna put off the violinist, isn't it?

547
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,380
 (audience laughing)

548
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,860
 Fondle the orchestra.

549
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,900
 You're still hard to touch, Madame Tussauds.

550
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,740
 I think that's the whole point.

551
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,580
 - On the option.

552
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,420
 - Are you?

553
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,260
 - I think so.

554
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,460
 - I don't know, I haven't been for years.

555
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,020
 When I used to go, you weren't allowed to touch them,

556
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,660
 but I think more recently, they've allowed you

557
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,820
 to kind of put your arms around them

558
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,060
 and take selfies and stuff.

559
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,420
 - Yeah, I think we've mentioned before

560
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,580
 that they know that Brad Pitt

561
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,020
 is the most groped of the wax works

562
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,260
 at Madame Tussauds.

563
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,100
 - Yeah.

564
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,100
 - How do they know?

565
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,260
 They have someone watching.

566
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,380
 - No, the reason they know is because it's the one

567
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,500
 that they need to replace most often.

568
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,780
 Because people keep touching it,

569
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,580
 so it keeps the trousers need replacing

570
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,420
 and stuff like that.

571
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,260
 - Yeah.

572
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,420
 (audience laughing)

573
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,940
 - Oh, well, well.

574
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,420
 - Like I say, I haven't been for years.

575
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,180
 (audience laughing)

576
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,340
 Because I'm banned.

577
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,660
 (audience laughing)

578
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,260
 But Tom Hardy, for instance,

579
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,340
 the Tom Hardy model at Tussauds,

580
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,060
 he has a beating heart and a soft, warm torso.

581
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,900
 - What?

582
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,740
 - What?

583
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,220
 - So if you weren't allowed to touch him,

584
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,060
 there'd be no point having that, would there?

585
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,900
 - Yeah.

586
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,900
 - Is it actually Tom Hardy?

587
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,020
 'Cause he is very still in a lot of his shows, anyway, isn't he?

588
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,420
 - He's just had a lot of high anger,

589
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,340
 and he's stiffened him hard.

590
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,540
 (audience laughing)

591
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,620
 Arnold Schwarzenegger actually did that.

592
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,460
 - Yeah.

593
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,100
 - Arnold Schwarzenegger, there was a thing he was promoting,

594
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
 and for a stunt, he just stood in Madame Tussauds,

595
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,620
 dressed up like the terminator, you know,

596
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,780
 with the sort of metal showing through and injured,

597
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,460
 and then he would move and freak people out.

598
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,460
 (audience laughing)

599
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,180
 - Some of the religious kind of things

600
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,020
 that you can go and see.

601
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,860
 - Yeah.

602
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,260
 - The world's largest wooden construction,

603
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,020
 so the largest wooden construction in the whole world,

604
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,420
 is Noah's Ark.

605
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,260
 - Wow.

606
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,460
 - And it's a Noah's Ark in America,

607
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,620
 it's called the Ark Encounter,

608
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:17,460
 and it fits over 16,000 people simultaneously inside it.

609
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,500
 - But there are only supposed to be two, I thought.

610
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,940
 (audience laughing)

611
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,340
 - What a space, they have a lot of space.

612
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,940
 And, well, actually, there are a few more humans

613
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,940
 on Noah's Ark, wasn't there?

614
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,780
 - Yeah, there were.

615
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,620
 - So there was Noah and his wife,

616
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,900
 and there were his sons, so there was Shem.

617
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,060
 - Ham.

618
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,740
 - And the third one who has the more complicated name.

619
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,780
 Wait, someone knows it.

620
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,780
 (audience laughing)

621
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,620
 - Jedwood.

622
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,140
 (audience laughing)

623
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,220
 - That was two by two as well, Jedwood, wasn't it?

624
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,220
 (audience laughing)

625
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,460
 - I'm sorry, I heard Jedwood,

626
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,860
 because apparently in the Dublin Wax Museum,

627
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,420
 you can have a Jedwood made,

628
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,980
 but and there are only two for one deal.

629
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,660
 (audience laughing)

630
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,660
 - Who wants it again?

631
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,060
 - Jedwood. - JPEG.

632
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,060
 - JPEG.

633
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,900
 Okay.

634
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,060
 (audience laughing)

635
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,020
 So, it was, it was Shem Ham and JPEG.

636
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,100
 But the amazing thing is that this massive Noah's Ark

637
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,940
 was made by a guy called Ken Ham,

638
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,580
 which is the same name as someone I know as Ark.

639
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,140
 He's quite famous in America as being an extremely

640
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,140
 pious Catholic, anti-evolutionary kind of guy.

641
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,900
 And Bill Nye, the science guy,

642
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,620
 he went to see this Noah's Ark,

643
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,540
 and he said on the third deck of the Ark,

644
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,260
 "Every single science exhibit is absolutely wrong."

645
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,180
 (audience laughing)

646
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,460
 Not just misleading, but wrong.

647
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,300
 (audience laughing)

648
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,500
 So yeah, it's completely bad.

649
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,500
 And then Ken Ham, by the way,

650
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,220
 is trying to, this year and last year,

651
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,460
 trying to put the Jesus back into Halloween.

652
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,780
 (audience laughing)

653
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,380
 He's suggesting that people should go reverse trick

654
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,180
 or treating where you bring the baskets of goodies

655
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,060
 to bless your neighbors.

656
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,940
 - And what if they don't want one?

657
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,180
 You have to do something nice to them?

658
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,020
 (audience laughing)

659
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,940
 (audience laughing)

660
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,500
 - Well, good luck with that, Mr. Ham.

661
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,140
 - Did you know that baby Jesus theft

662
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,740
 has its own Wikipedia page?

663
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,900
 (audience laughing)

664
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,180
 - Is there much on it?

665
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,380
 - It's jam-packs to the rafters.

666
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,660
 Yeah, so Jesus is always getting stolen at Christmas

667
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,780
 as it happens.

668
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,620
 (audience laughing)

669
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,980
 And then there's this list that's always going neck

670
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,540
 from nativity scenes.

671
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,060
 Marilyn Manson wants to stole a whole bunch of them.

672
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,980
 He admitted later, he stole a whole bunch of Jesus'

673
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,580
 and actually oddly replaced them with Ham's.

674
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,380
 (audience laughing)

675
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,180
 So maybe that was a tribute to Ken.

676
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,020
 - Wow.

677
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,100
 - I was thinking Marilyn Manson,

678
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,940
 did he not have a song called "Personal Jesus"?

679
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,780
 - Did he?

680
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,620
 - No, he did, didn't he?

681
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,900
 - So he's just going, "That's my personal Jesus."

682
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,740
 (audience laughing)

683
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,740
 "That's my personal Jesus."

684
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,460
 And actually, this is what you said earlier.

685
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,020
 I read a quote from a historian of baby Jesus thefts

686
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,980
 who (audience laughing)

687
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,660
 he may have other strings to his boat

688
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,660
 who's called Daniel Silliman and (audience laughing)

689
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,780
 - Come on.

690
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,900
 - Absolutely.

691
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,300
 Sorry, Silliman, what's your very serious paper

692
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,140
 about this time?

693
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,380
 (audience laughing)

694
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,660
 Anyway, he said, "Baby Jesus thieves literally

695
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,180
 "take the Christ out of Christmas."

696
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,900
 - Oh.

697
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,180
 - Which I think is worth reflecting on.

698
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,020
 - Yeah.

699
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,380
 Okay, it is time for fact number three,

700
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,260
 and that is James.

701
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,620
 - Okay, my fact this week is that a giraffe

702
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,020
 with breathing problems can be treated

703
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,820
 by using a leaf blower.

704
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,660
 (audience laughing)

705
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,380
 - Is it on suck or blow?

706
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,140
 (audience laughing)

707
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,300
 - I think it's on blow.

708
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,900
 - Or they're always on blow, aren't they?

709
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,340
 - Leaf blower is generally, yeah, yeah, yeah.

710
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,020
 (audience laughing)

711
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,620
 - Otherwise they'd be leaf suckers.

712
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,620
 (audience laughing)

713
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,940
 - My leaf blower sucks.

714
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,980
 (audience laughing)

715
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,100
 So this, Andy was the only person

716
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,500
 in the room who found that funny, which (audience laughing)

717
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,380
 - So, where were you all?

718
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,300
 (audience laughing)

719
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,780
 - So, this is a 2007 paper by Cetano et al.

720
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,260
 And what did al contributes to what he did?

721
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,420
 (audience laughing)

722
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,060
 - And what happened was they had to

723
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,260
 anesthetize a giraffe, but as anesthetized in it,

724
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,620
 and then it had trouble breathing,

725
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,300
 and they managed to fix it by getting a gas powered leaf blower

726
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,100
 and then attaching it to a few other parts

727
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,100
 and managed to artificially ventilate this giraffe.

728
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,820
 - By blowing into it's mouth?

729
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,820
 - Through it's trickier and into it's lungs.

730
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,660
 - Wow. - Ooh, wow.

731
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,260
 - And got all the leaves out of it's inside.

732
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,220
 (audience laughing)

733
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,300
 - Yeah, well, copy's like, is anyone else hungry?

734
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,620
 (audience laughing)

735
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,580
 - The thing I've always find weird about giraffes

736
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,740
 is that, I think we've done this on QI years ago,

737
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,620
 is that when they were first spotted by the Romans,

738
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,140
 they called them the camel leopard.

739
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,780
 So they, someone saw a giraffe

740
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,260
 and thought, what's the striking thing about this?

741
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,380
 Well, it looks like it crossed me in a camel and a leopard.

742
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,180
 And in fact, he noted, this animal is like a camel

743
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,020
 in all respects, except that its legs are not

744
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,140
 at the same length.

745
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,660
 (audience laughing)

746
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,260
 - The skin is spotted like a leopard, so we're cool.

747
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,820
 I mean, what about the neck place?

748
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,660
 - Yeah, nice.

749
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,180
 - This is something that wasn't looking up.

750
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,620
 - You know, it was only until recently

751
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,940
 that we found out there was more than one giraffe.

752
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,460
 That was a, you mean, more than what species of giraffe?

753
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,540
 - Yeah.

754
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,500
 (audience laughing)

755
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,620
 - Because actually if they were all studying a line,

756
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,820
 and you could only see the one right next to you.

757
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,180
 - Oh, yeah, I mean, there was more than one species.

758
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,060
 So we thought up until now that it was just giraffe,

759
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,460
 and there was subspecies within giraffe,

760
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,140
 but now there's four.

761
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,980
 - Wow.

762
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,740
 - And what there's always been,

763
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,500
 but we've just suddenly been like, whoa, there's three more.

764
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,300
 - So there's a thing about their nerves,

765
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,740
 and it's a really annoying thing for them.

766
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,220
 It doesn't affect them too much, but so most vertebrates,

767
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,020
 we have these things called a laryngeal nerves,

768
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,380
 and they help to send signals to all the organs in your body.

769
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,140
 And in all mammals, they branch off the vagus nerve,

770
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,500
 that how it's pronounced, at vagus nerve.

771
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,780
 - Oh, that's good to know,

772
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,460
 because we mentioned that in this next episode

773
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,300
 that's going on.

774
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,100
 - And you're not going to like how we say it.

775
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,420
 (audience laughing)

776
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,420
 So they branch off the vagus nerve,

777
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,460
 and then one of them loops under the aorta,

778
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,940
 and then back to the, is it larynx?

779
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,940
 (audience laughing)

780
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,940
 (audience laughing)

781
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,500
 So then it loops back to the larynx,

782
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,580
 and it's a bit awkward, but it's only a few inches longer

783
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,380
 in almost all mammals.

784
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,660
 Unfortunately, in giraffes, they've got these really long neck,

785
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,220
 so the nerve has to go on this massive detour

786
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,260
 all the way down.

787
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,620
 So in humans, it's six inches long,

788
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,780
 and it should only be about six inches long for giraffes,

789
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,180
 but in giraffes, it's 15 feet long,

790
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,660
 'cause it has to go all the way down the neck,

791
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,500
 and then back up.

792
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,660
 - Whoa, wow.

793
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,860
 - And that's the nerve.

794
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,900
 - That's the nerve, yeah.

795
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,580
 - So does that mean if you like slap a giraffe

796
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,340
 on the chest, then it won't feel it for ages.

797
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,220
 - Well, actually that is kind of true.

798
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,740
 So this is not the vagus nerve,

799
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,900
 but one of the other nerves.

800
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,260
 So it takes a rat 4.5 milliseconds to respond to stimuli.

801
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,580
 If you stand on a rat's foot, it would take that long,

802
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,860
 but a giraffe, it takes 100 milliseconds

803
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,020
 to sense a response to something.

804
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,660
 So like if you stand on a giraffe's foot,

805
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,740
 it would take what, I don't know, 25 times longer.

806
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,580
 - Wow.

807
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,820
 - So it'd be very dangerous drivers, wouldn't they?

808
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,140
 (audience laughing)

809
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,540
 - Very slow reactions.

810
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,820
 (audience laughing)

811
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,580
 And also, you'd have to cut a hole

812
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,580
 and top of your car.

813
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,820
 (audience laughing)

814
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,900
 It was, I think, the first giraffe that came over here,

815
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,340
 or the really famous giraffe that came to Britain in 1827,

816
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,500
 I think it was, came apparently in a boat

817
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,020
 where they had to have a hole drilled in the deck of the boat

818
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,420
 so that it could travel.

819
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,580
 - Well, that was to France, wasn't it?

820
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,260
 - There were three, and they were given

821
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,420
 by the visor of Egypt, weren't they?

822
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,220
 And it was sort of like dealing cards.

823
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,980
 He gave three giraffes, one to Britain,

824
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,900
 one to France, one to Austria,

825
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,460
 and bizarrely, they were transported from Egypt

826
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,020
 over to Western Europe on the backs of camels.

827
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,860
 - Yeah.

828
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,700
 - What?

829
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,540
 - Yeah.

830
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,380
 - They were strapped to camel.

831
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,180
 - They were, they were, they were small when they started.

832
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,860
 They were, they were young giraffes when they started.

833
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,700
 - Ah, alright.

834
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,260
 - So for the first stage, they were put in a camel.

835
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,100
 - Ah.

836
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,300
 - So how long was the trip though?

837
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,780
 That's a long, it was, it's so long.

838
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,220
 It took two and a half years to get them from Sudan

839
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,860
 to, no wonder, to the, trick the camel to begin with,

840
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,660
 by going, this guy's tiny, he'll be fine.

841
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,940
 (audience laughing)

842
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,380
 One year in, this guy's, what the fuck is this?

843
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,620
 (audience laughing)

844
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,180
 This guy's just like me, but we're slightly longer legs.

845
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,180
 (audience laughing)

846
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,540
 - It was amazing though.

847
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,260
 They, so the one that went to France was called Zeraffa,

848
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,740
 and Zeraffa had three nannies who were all cows.

849
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,580
 - Yes.

850
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,340
 - Because he needed six gallons of milk every day

851
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,180
 to keep growing.

852
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,020
 - Yeah.

853
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,860
 - Wow.

854
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,500
 - So these cows all went along for the ride as well.

855
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
 - So wet nurse nannies, rather than,

856
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,580
 it wasn't nannies who played with him with rattles

857
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,420
 and stuff, was like, they suckled at the cows' teeth.

858
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,020
 They must have had a massive identity crisis

859
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,020
 by the time they arrived.

860
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,300
 - They suckled the cows' teeth.

861
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,300
 - Yeah, they suckled.

862
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,180
 - How do you suck a lot of cows' teeth?

863
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,100
 Is it's cow really, really high and still, so something?

864
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,340
 - The cow is on the back of a huge donkey.

865
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,820
 (audience laughing)

866
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,380
 - Yeah, maybe they put the cow on stills,

867
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,220
 I don't know, it's not like a lot of effort to go to,

868
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,860
 but they suckled the cows.

869
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,700
 - Wow.

870
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,780
 - Yeah.

871
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,660
 - We think that we thought, until recently,

872
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,020
 that giraffes were loners.

873
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,460
 And now, apparently, it turns out,

874
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,620
 they can just see each other from further away.

875
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,460
 (audience laughing)

876
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,300
 - And they genuinely, so...

877
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,580
 - But they couldn't talk to each other

878
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,700
 from that distance, could they?

879
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,020
 - They can communicate from a fair,

880
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,460
 I think from about a hundred feet away.

881
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,900
 They can, 'cause they have infrastructure today.

882
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,860
 - I think they can harm at volumes that we can't.

883
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,580
 - Well, no, they've been here.

884
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,180
 - Yeah, we've been for centuries.

885
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,780
 I've been trying to work out how they communicate

886
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,740
 through voice, because they don't really hear

887
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,700
 giraffes communicating, so they think house is done.

888
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,780
 And in zoos, they did a study to see whether or not

889
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,140
 they could capture them talking to each other.

890
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,340
 And the conclusion is that they have found them

891
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,740
 talking to each other at night,

892
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,500
 and it is through, as you say, hums.

893
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,580
 So they hear these hums,

894
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,580
 and they're done in different patterns and so on,

895
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,500
 so they think they're talking to each other.

896
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,780
 There's a slight thought that it could also be them snoring.

897
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,620
 They're not sure.

898
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,620
 (audience laughing)

899
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,780
 'Cause it's curious that they do it only at night.

900
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,820
 - Maybe it's one of them snoring,

901
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,900
 and the other one's saying,

902
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,420
 "Can you just turn over, please?"

903
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,820
 (audience laughing)

904
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,660
 - That's it.

905
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,260
 - Do you know the weirdest thing about giraffes

906
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,780
 are of all quadrupeds.

907
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,340
 They're the only known ones that can't swim naturally.

908
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,660
 So every single four-legged animal you've ever seen

909
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,620
 is a natural swimmer, and so not like we are,

910
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,820
 we have to learn to swim if you drop a baby in the water,

911
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,860
 it will sink, same with an ape, which actually they did.

912
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,700
 I think in the early 20th century,

913
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,020
 they retrieved them, but they dropped lots of monkeys

914
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,180
 into water, watched them for a while,

915
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,580
 and they all flailed, and then sank quite quickly,

916
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,460
 then they got them out again.

917
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,460
 - Do when you live by the ocean,

918
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,140
 as in I'm just wondering if they live inland,

919
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,580
 it's only lakes, they're probably tall enough,

920
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,860
 they've never had to learn to swim, 'cause they're next around.

921
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,300
 - Maybe, crossing a river,

922
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,420
 you can just walk across the riverbed, aren't you?

923
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,500
 - Well, you don't know until you try.

924
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,380
 As in, you don't know that a giraffe can't tell

925
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,500
 the depth of the river by just looking at it.

926
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,180
 They'll come a point where you're walking into the river,

927
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,740
 and you think, "This is fine, this is fine,

928
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,900
 "this is not fine."

929
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,100
 - Yeah, yeah.

930
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,060
 - But then you're the exciting explorer,

931
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,860
 and then the rest of going, "All right, Mike didn't make it,

932
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,940
 "let's find another way."

933
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,900
 (laughing)

934
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,940
 We're gonna have to move on shortly.

935
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,780
 Just quickly, I found the fact about leaf blowers

936
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,180
 and animals, so your fact was a giraffe

937
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,780
 with breathing problems can be treated using a leaf blower.

938
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,780
 I have to admit, and this is genuinely true,

939
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,700
 right until you said it tonight, I misread it.

940
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,820
 I thought you said a giraffe with breathing problems

941
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,460
 can be used as a leaf blower.

942
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,580
 (laughing)

943
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,180
 Honestly, as you read it tonight,

944
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,620
 they're the one giraffes that can't be used to blow leaves.

945
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,060
 I thought that's what it was,

946
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,260
 so I looked into other animals

947
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,820
 that can be used as a leaf blower.

948
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,900
 (laughing)

949
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,900
 - I think we do need to interrogate for a second

950
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,460
 how you thought a giraffe was gonna be used as a leaf blower.

951
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,340
 Was it like, when you play wheelbarrow at school in races,

952
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,540
 you hold its legs, but it's nose to the ground?

953
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,580
 - Yeah, I turn out, 'cause the only,

954
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,620
 I thought it was a bit of a cruel fact to use, to be honest.

955
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,100
 I was, 'cause I thought they must have this sort of push

956
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,940
 that with a break in between, 'cause it's like a wheeze,

957
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,980
 and they probably lean over because it's hurting,

958
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,420
 so they're going, they're like, wow, this is really effective

959
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,220
 in zoos, let's walk the giraffe around

960
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,220
 with the breathing problems, and let's clean this place up.

961
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,780
 Anyway, so elephants also use their trunks

962
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,300
 as a makeshift leaf blower, as it were.

963
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,620
 - Don't say all so.

964
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,900
 (laughing)

965
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,740
 (laughing)

966
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,420
 - So elephants, they have this thing.

967
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,020
 - Where if they're in vicinity of inaccessible food,

968
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:32,500
 because a bit too tight for them to get to the food,

969
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,540
 what they do is they blow at the food

970
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,780
 if there's some sort of tree or wall, let's say,

971
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,500
 that's in the way, and it bounces the food off it

972
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,140
 and back towards them, and that's how they can get their food.

973
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,300
 And this is something we've been observing about elephants

974
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,020
 for a very long time, in fact,

975
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,780
 in the descent of man by Charles Darwin,

976
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,300
 he writes about the leaf blowing that wasn't invented then.

977
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,060
 So, way ahead of his time, Charles Darwin.

978
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,820
 - It's interesting, 'cause it's a bit like them using tools,

979
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,660
 isn't it, because they've basically solved a problem

980
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,180
 to be able to get food closer to them,

981
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,180
 which I think is really cool.

982
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,020
 - Yeah, it's really amazing.

983
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,300
 - I was looking at a few other weird things

984
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,780
 that Vets had done, and just this one thing I found,

985
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,980
 which I really liked, it's not quite that,

986
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,540
 but there was a spiny antita called Matilda,

987
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:18,180
 who had inflamed skin, bald patches, and bulging puffy eyes.

988
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,300
 And it turned out that she was allergic to ants.

989
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,500
 - Wow. - She's an antita allergic to ants.

990
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,420
 And actually, yeah. - Where's your puffy eyes?

991
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,260
 - Puffy eyes, yeah.

992
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,980
 - They should have just put a live crab.

993
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,420
 (audience laughing)

994
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:35,580
 Around the neck, problem solved.

995
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,060
 - They made a vaccine for her, that's it.

996
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,900
 - Oh, okay.

997
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,260
 Okay, time for our final fact of the show,

998
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,580
 and that is Andy.

999
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,180
 My fact is that when 3,000 British teenagers

1000
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,420
 were surveyed in 2008, 20% said that they thought

1001
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,940
 Winston Churchill was a fictional character.

1002
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,060
 (audience laughing)

1003
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,740
 - They can all vote now, can't they?

1004
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,580
 - Yep.

1005
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,820
 (audience laughing)

1006
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,220
 So, and this is just sort of, you know,

1007
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,060
 things that gets thrown up by opinion polls,

1008
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,980
 so the same poll found that 27% thought

1009
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,420
 that Florence Nightingale had never existed,

1010
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,740
 and the 47% thought that Richard the Lionheart was fictional,

1011
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,740
 which I can kind of understand,

1012
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,260
 'cause that sounds like it. - Yeah, it sounds like it.

1013
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,100
 - Sounds like it.

1014
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,620
 - Sounds maybe happy, doesn't Richard the Lionheart, yeah, sure.

1015
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,820
 But 47% thought that Eleanor Rigby was real.

1016
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,100
 - Oh. - So.

1017
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,500
 - Well, there wasn't real one, was there?

1018
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,940
 - Yeah, I mean, in a way she was,

1019
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,060
 because Paul McCartney did see the name Eleanor Rigby

1020
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,580
 on a tombstone, he didn't know her, or her story,

1021
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,340
 but there was, well, 47% of British teenagers in 2008

1022
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,700
 knew that Beatles arcane anecdote.

1023
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,220
 (audience laughing)

1024
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,100
 There was a month later, they did another survey,

1025
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,380
 and one in three primary school pupils thought

1026
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,300
 that he was the first man to walk on the moon

1027
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,980
 when it's the Churchill.

1028
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,860
 Cool. - Well, I think a lot of these things,

1029
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,260
 it must be like, they just give you a name of a person,

1030
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,460
 they go, real or not real, and you just go,

1031
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,660
 I don't know. - Yeah.

1032
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,500
 - Especially at primary school,

1033
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
 you don't care what you're crossing,

1034
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,820
 you're just excited someone's giving you a felt tip.

1035
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,060
 (audience laughing)

1036
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,860
 - But so, they, just bringing up moon,

1037
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,140
 it's not as if they think he's fictional,

1038
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,820
 as in it's a conspiracy that he was invented as an idea,

1039
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,980
 'cause you know there was all that stuff,

1040
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,220
 about the fact that we'll fight them on the beaches,

1041
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,500
 was said by someone else, a voice actor.

1042
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,940
 Which is not true, I don't think,

1043
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,300
 but there was an idea that he had never...

1044
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,740
 - It is true, there was a voice actor.

1045
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,820
 - Yeah, yeah, it was a voice actor.

1046
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,340
 The famous recording that we have,

1047
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,740
 or many of the famous recordings that we have,

1048
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,100
 in fact, of Winston Churchill,

1049
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,060
 I think we're recorded after the war.

1050
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,740
 - Churchill himself did a few in a studio,

1051
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,020
 but there are broadcasts which were done by a voice actor.

1052
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,860
 - Okay, right.

1053
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,780
 You know, he has been a fictional character

1054
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,980
 in some respects. - Okay, yes.

1055
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,620
 - I went on to Comic Thine website,

1056
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,540
 and found that there's 164 comic books

1057
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,420
 with Winston Churchill as a character in them.

1058
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,260
 - Wow.

1059
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,900
 - He's been in Star Trek, Comic, Eagle, Justice League,

1060
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,740
 Super Buy, Captain America, Green Lantern,

1061
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,140
 and Santa Claus versus the Nazis.

1062
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,460
 (audience laughing)

1063
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,780
 - Wow.

1064
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,780
 They're the main ones.

1065
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,740
 - He wasn't very good in studies.

1066
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,500
 I mean, I know there's a thing that's often said about Churchill,

1067
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,180
 but I do think it's quite reassuring

1068
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,620
 when you realize how bad he was at school.

1069
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,860
 - So he failed basically everything

1070
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,780
 that he didn't like except history in English.

1071
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,380
 He failed his entrance exam to university twice

1072
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,860
 or to the Royal Military College,

1073
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,420
 which I don't think was that hard to get into.

1074
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,700
 But he failed that twice.

1075
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,780
 - Well, he failed everything except history in English.

1076
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,500
 - Oh, he did very badly in it.

1077
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,740
 Yeah. - Okay, but history in English

1078
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,740
 was two best ones.

1079
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,580
 - I think so, yeah.

1080
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,420
 - And then later on, he won the Nobel Prize for Literature

1081
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,740
 and defeated Nazis, history, and English.

1082
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,900
 (audience laughing)

1083
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,900
 - So what we're saying, kids, is specialize.

1084
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,740
 - Yeah.

1085
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,580
 (audience laughing)

1086
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,660
 - If you know good at French, fuck it.

1087
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,660
 (audience laughing)

1088
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,660
 (audience laughing)

1089
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,860
 - Is that what we're saying?

1090
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,380
 (audience laughing)

1091
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,620
 - How do we are that divided a country after all?

1092
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,700
 - You're in Roosevelt, FDR, I first met him.

1093
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,500
 He first met him in 1918.

1094
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,580
 So I would have been just after he'd come out

1095
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,980
 from fighting the First World War

1096
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,420
 and they were on a diplomatic mission

1097
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,580
 and he met Churchill as a soldier

1098
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,060
 and called him a stinker, hated him.

1099
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,220
 - So they obviously became really close

1100
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,860
 in the Second World War, but the only thing he said

1101
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,460
 about what it's in Churchill was, what a stinker.

1102
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,900
 - What does stinker mean in that?

1103
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,740
 Does it mean just a bad person or like actually smirk?

1104
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,980
 - It means a stinker. - Oh really?

1105
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,060
 - What is, you're a stinker, you know,

1106
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,740
 like in a playground, if you call someone a stinker,

1107
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,900
 then-- - I know, not only too well.

1108
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,900
 (audience laughing)

1109
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,740
 Oh.

1110
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,180
 (audience laughing)

1111
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,300
 So Churchill first became famous in the Boer War

1112
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,340
 as a reporter, didn't he?

1113
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,940
 But then as a correspondent, he got captured

1114
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,620
 and he had to escape and then the tales of his escape

1115
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,380
 became really, really famous.

1116
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,580
 But when he did escape, they raised the alarm

1117
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,340
 and they gave a description of him

1118
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,580
 so they could find him.

1119
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,460
 And they said, "Escape to Prisoner of War,

1120
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,220
 Winston Spencer Churchill, Englishman, 25 years old,

1121
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,420
 "about five foot eight inches tall, medium build,

1122
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,460
 "walks with a slight stoop, pale features,

1123
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,380
 "reddish brown hair, almost invisible, small mustache,

1124
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,540
 "speaks through his nose, cannot pronounce the letter S,

1125
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,020
 "and cannot speak one word of Dutch."

1126
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,460
 - Oh, wow. - And that's your great Winston Churchill.

1127
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,460
 - Oh. - Yeah?

1128
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,100
 - Almost invisible, small mustache.

1129
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,820
 Wait, you there, stop.

1130
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,260
 No, that's too visible, a small mustache.

1131
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,100
 You're free to go.

1132
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,700
 (audience laughing)

1133
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,660
 - That was Hitler, wasn't it, in that respect?

1134
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,660
 (audience laughing)

1135
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,500
 - Can I tell you just a really quick Churchill thing,

1136
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,940
 there's quite tangentially related,

1137
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,660
 but this was actually one of our researchers

1138
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,500
 sent me the book with us in the other day.

1139
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,500
 And it's that Winston Churchill had a son-in-law,

1140
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,060
 Duncan Sandis, who was a minister for a brief time in the '60s.

1141
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,740
 And basically, Winston Churchill's son-in-law was forced

1142
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,460
 by Harold McMillan's government to go to the doctor

1143
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,580
 to have his penis compared to a penis in a salacious photo

1144
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,820
 to prove that it wasn't the same penis.

1145
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,380
 And it's just such a good story.

1146
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,820
 So there was this huge ruckus in the early '60s

1147
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,900
 because someone was caught having a blowjob

1148
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,620
 given to them by a Dutchess.

1149
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,220
 And their head wasn't in the picture.

1150
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,500
 So you can only see the other regions.

1151
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,540
 And it was gonna be this huge scandal.

1152
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,900
 And everyone said it's this guy.

1153
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,860
 It's the minister of defense, Duncan Sandis.

1154
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,620
 And so he eventually had to go,

1155
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,100
 he was made to go to Harley Street by the government

1156
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,860
 with this photo in one hand and this willy in the other.

1157
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,900
 (audience laughing)

1158
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,460
 - How did he ring the bell?

1159
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,460
 (audience laughing)

1160
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,460
 (audience laughing)

1161
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:33,700
 - Anyway, they confirmed it wasn't the same penis.

1162
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,540
 - Wow.

1163
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,980
 - We should talk as well about surveys

1164
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,780
 'cause surveys, they always bring up the weirdest

1165
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,500
 of revelations about what people think around the world.

1166
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,220
 I really like that.

1167
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,300
 There was a survey done about what we think sci-fi things

1168
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,380
 are real and not real that we hear about.

1169
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,620
 So, for example, over a fifth of adults,

1170
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,780
 and this was in Birmingham, did this as a survey.

1171
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,420
 Over a fifth of adults incorrectly believe

1172
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,220
 that lightsabers exist as a real thing.

1173
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,780
 Nearly a quarter, 24% of people believe

1174
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,620
 that humans can be teleporters.

1175
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,660
 (audience laughing)

1176
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,660
 That's quite cool.

1177
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,060
 40% believe that hoverboards exist.

1178
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,900
 I mean, it's a--

1179
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,300
 - I think they didn't invent a hoverboard.

1180
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,660
 'Cause I thought they invented the world's first hoverboard

1181
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,500
 a couple of years ago.

1182
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,020
 - They also had those really rubbish

1183
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,180
 kind of things on two wheels that like a segway

1184
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,220
 without the stick and they were called hoverboards.

1185
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,580
 Maybe I'm thinking of that.

1186
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,260
 They didn't invent one.

1187
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,820
 I think it might have been a bit rubbish.

1188
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,380
 - 11% of teenagers think that fruit pastels

1189
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,860
 count as one of your five a day.

1190
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,860
 - Which color?

1191
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,700
 - Any color?

1192
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,540
 - Any color.

1193
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,540
 - They're all fruit.

1194
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,540
 - They're all fruit.

1195
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,380
 - Well, fruit and meat pastels, are they?

1196
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,180
 (audience laughing)

1197
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,380
 Although I've just had an amazing idea.

1198
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,380
 (audience laughing)

1199
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,660
 - Well, 11.5 tubes of fruit pastels

1200
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,700
 would give you about as much vitamin C as a piece of fruit.

1201
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,620
 - So Yugav do obviously loads and loads and loads of pulse

1202
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,740
 and they build up these huge, you know,

1203
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,140
 crunching amounts of data based on, you know,

1204
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,460
 just they pick one thing that people divide into

1205
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,900
 like right-handed or left-handed

1206
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,380
 and then they can find out massive amounts

1207
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,860
 about the tendencies.

1208
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,740
 So Yugav surveys have found,

1209
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,580
 and they've sort of crunched the loaded numbers together,

1210
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,620
 that a quarter of leave voters like their stakes well done

1211
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:20,260
 but only 12% of remain voters like their stakes well done.

1212
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,540
 More leave voters than remain voters

1213
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,060
 think that Doctor Who votes conservative.

1214
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,380
 (audience laughing)

1215
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,820
 - Remain voters think you would probably vote green.

1216
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,260
 (audience laughing)

1217
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,420
 - She.

1218
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,260
 - Oh.

1219
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,660
 (audience laughing)

1220
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,660
 - Well thanks a bunch, Shoez, I've got up to Chris Ackelston.

1221
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,660
 (audience laughing)

1222
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:45,900
 - Well, get ready to be angry.

1223
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,540
 (audience laughing)

1224
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,980
 - Um, I found this amazing.

1225
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,420
 There was a survey done last year

1226
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,300
 that found 35% of French people cannot name

1227
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,380
 the French Prime Minister.

1228
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,220
 - What?

1229
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,420
 - Which, I mean, can you?

1230
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,260
 - No.

1231
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,100
 (audience laughing)

1232
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,940
 - The French Prime Minister.

1233
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,260
 - Who the President is Macron?

1234
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,260
 - Yes, indeed.

1235
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,380
 - Does that get, is that what the half point?

1236
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,180
 - You don't get bonus points for naming that cross.

1237
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,020
 - This is the worst pub quiz I've ever been to.

1238
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,340
 (audience laughing)

1239
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,300
 - So who is it?

1240
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,820
 - It's a guy called Edward Philippe.

1241
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,900
 - I have to say I'd never heard of it.

1242
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,740
 - I could have guessed that.

1243
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,340
 I would have said two random French names.

1244
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,340
 It got pretty close.

1245
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,940
 (audience laughing)

1246
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,620
 - He's not incredible more than a third.

1247
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,220
 I don't know that own Prime Minister is.

1248
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,580
 Apparently on the survey a lot of people put Gerard Philippe

1249
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,980
 or I think it's an actor or Louis Philippe,

1250
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,580
 who's obviously, you know, early French king.

1251
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,500
 But yeah, they don't know that PM.

1252
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,420
 And I think probably Britain might be

1253
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,140
 in the same position at this stage, but yeah.

1254
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,020
 - By the time this goes out next week.

1255
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,260
 (audience laughing)

1256
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,900
 - There was a survey done in America about the cloud

1257
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,940
 or cloud computing putting up in the clouds.

1258
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,780
 And 51% of the Americans answered to the survey

1259
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,780
 I said that they thought that if it was a stormy

1260
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,020
 weather situation outside, that would affect them

1261
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,780
 getting access to their cloud information.

1262
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,780
 It's fair enough.

1263
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,380
 - There was a tech poll a few years ago where 11% of people

1264
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,060
 believe that HTML was a sexually transmitted disease.

1265
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,180
 (audience laughing)

1266
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,220
 - So that was a survey, a study that was looking

1267
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,940
 into how many people understood techy sounding words.

1268
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,100
 So as well as that.

1269
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,060
 - How many people thought that JPEG was a character

1270
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:19,900
 in the Bible?

1271
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,900
 (audience laughing)

1272
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:29,580
 - So as well as HTML is sexually transmitted disease,

1273
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,180
 they found that 27% of the people doing it

1274
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,700
 thought Gigabyte was an insect commonly found

1275
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,900
 in South America.

1276
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,980
 (audience laughing)

1277
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,620
 18% thought Blu-ray was a marine animal.

1278
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:45,620
 And 23% thought MP3 was a Star Wars robot.

1279
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:48,260
 (audience laughing)

1280
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,700
 - To be fair, in five years time,

1281
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,180
 no one's gonna know what an MP3 is,

1282
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,180
 and almost no one knows what a Blu-ray was.

1283
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,940
 So they were just ahead of their time.

1284
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,460
 - Oh, thanks, I'll just put all of Doctor Who on Blu-ray.

1285
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,820
 (audience laughing)

1286
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,060
 - All right guys, we need to wrap up.

1287
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,220
 Okay, that is it.

1288
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,300
 That is all of our facts.

1289
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,860

 No such thing as a fish.com.

1301
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,380
 We got everything up there from upcoming tour dates

1302
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,140
 to our book, a link to buy it to everything.

1303

 And before we wrap up, we're gonna very quickly read out

1305
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,420
 the winner of tonight's prequel book.

1306
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,420
 - Wow.

1307
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,420
 (audience laughing)

1308
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,060
 - So James, you've picked a winner.

1309
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,620
 - Yes, so this fact is from Becky,

1310
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,940
 whose friend Chris Lemon has a birthday today.

1311
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:48,940
 And it is. - Happy birthday.

1312
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,780
 - Happy birthday, Chris.

1313
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,620
 If you're here.

1314
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,460
 - Thank you.

1315
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,660
 (audience laughing)

1316
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,500
 - Well, Becky's fact is that in 1974,

1317
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,140
 a research scientist, Dr. Sommelin,

1318
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,860
 announced that he had successfully transplanted skin

1319
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,540
 from a black mouse onto a white mouse.

1320
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,580
 It was later discovered that he had actually

1321
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,980
 coloured the white mouse in with a black pen.

1322
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,980
 (audience laughing)

1323
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:18,740
 That's an amazing fact.

1324
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,340
 Okay, guys, we're gonna be outside

1325
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,220
 signing these books if you want one.

1326
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,380
 Thank you so much for being here.

1327
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,460
 We really appreciate it.

1328
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,660
 We'll be back again next week.

1329
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,180
 Goodbye.

1330
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,180
 (audience cheering)

1331
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,760
 (upbeat music)

1332
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,760
 (audience clapping)

1333
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,340
 (upbeat music)
