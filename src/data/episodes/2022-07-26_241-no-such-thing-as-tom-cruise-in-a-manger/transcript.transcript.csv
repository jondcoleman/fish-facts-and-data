00:00:10,00:00:22,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:22,00:00:25,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast."
00:00:25,00:00:28,"This week coming to you live from our book of the year,"
00:00:28,00:00:30,2018 Tour in Norenga!
00:00:30,00:00:32,(cheering)
00:00:32,00:00:38,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:38,00:00:41,"I am sitting here with Anichezinski,"
00:00:41,00:00:43,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and Jane Tarkin."
00:00:43,00:00:45,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:45,00:00:48,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:48,00:00:52,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:52,00:00:56,"Starting with you, Anichezinski."
00:00:56,00:01:00,"- Yes, my fact this week is that old European malaria remedies"
00:01:00,00:01:03,included throwing the patient headfirst into a bush
00:01:03,00:01:05,in the hope that he'd get out quickly enough
00:01:05,00:01:06,to leave the fever behind.
00:01:06,00:01:09,(laughing)
00:01:09,00:01:12,"Yeah, just got tangled up in there, can't get out,"
00:01:12,00:01:14,"and you scarper, that was how you did it."
00:01:14,00:01:17,"And this was used all the way up until the 17th century,"
00:01:17,00:01:20,"basically until the 1600s, no one knew how to cure malaria."
00:01:20,00:01:24,And so they just made up a lot of wacky shit.
00:01:24,00:01:27,And I wonder what they thought happened to the malaria in the bush?
00:01:27,00:01:29,"Did it stay there, like if you went through a walk through the bush?"
00:01:29,00:01:30,"- Yeah, it is a cup."
00:01:30,00:01:33,"- It is a bit like that, so it's called passing through."
00:01:33,00:01:35,And it's kind of an old folklore thing.
00:01:35,00:01:37,They did it for lots of different diseases.
00:01:37,00:01:40,Sometimes it would be a hole in a tree or a hole in a stone
00:01:40,00:01:42,"or something like that, and you would pass through the hole."
00:01:42,00:01:44,And the idea is you would leave the disease behind you.
00:01:44,00:01:46,"And actually it happened in America,"
00:01:46,00:01:49,"they didn't, perhaps they didn't have trees or stones,"
00:01:49,00:01:52,but they used to climb under the belly of a donkey.
00:01:52,00:01:54,And the idea is you would leave your disease behind.
00:01:54,00:01:57,- And is it that it gets so distracted by the inside of the tree
00:01:57,00:01:59,"or the belly of the donkey that it goes,"
00:01:59,00:02:01,"""Oh, look, and it loses sight of it."""
00:02:01,00:02:02,- I don't think so.
00:02:02,00:02:04,- I don't think they really knew what was going on with it.
00:02:04,00:02:06,"- Yeah, malaria is not like me,"
00:02:06,00:02:07,just distracted by any idiotic thing.
00:02:07,00:02:09,"Ooh, what's wrong with it?"
00:02:09,00:02:12,"- But yeah, so of course the, as soon as the tree"
00:02:12,00:02:15,"that has quinine in it was discovered suddenly,"
00:02:15,00:02:16,everyone could be cured of malaria.
00:02:16,00:02:18,"And that was in, well, this is by Western Europeans,"
00:02:18,00:02:21,it was discovered in the 17th century.
00:02:21,00:02:23,"So they went over to Peru,"
00:02:23,00:02:26,and they found the indigenous people were just using the bark
00:02:26,00:02:29,from this tree called the canchona tree.
00:02:29,00:02:30,"You know, that's how you pronounce it."
00:02:30,00:02:32,And that just cures it.
00:02:32,00:02:33,"And so they started using it,"
00:02:33,00:02:34,"and then all their problems were over,"
00:02:34,00:02:36,no more running in and out of bushes.
00:02:36,00:02:38,"- Yeah, it was a tough time up until then."
00:02:38,00:02:39,"- It was, 'cause there's quite a few other things"
00:02:39,00:02:41,"they tried as well as the bush thing, wasn't it?"
00:02:41,00:02:43,It wasn't just the bush thing.
00:02:43,00:02:45,So eating an onion with the word armen on it.
00:02:45,00:02:47,- With the word armen?
00:02:47,00:02:48,- Armen.
00:02:48,00:02:49,- Was this for malaria to get rid of them?
00:02:49,00:02:50,"- Yeah, the armen."
00:02:50,00:02:51,"- Well, it didn't work either."
00:02:51,00:02:55,"- But you can't, I mean, very few anions have the word armen on them."
00:02:55,00:02:57,"- So if you can find one of those,"
00:02:57,00:02:59,I think you deserve to be cured.
00:02:59,00:03:01,"- Yeah, you were allowed to write it on yourself."
00:03:01,00:03:02,"- Oh, fine."
00:03:02,00:03:05,"- Smirring cow manure on your body,"
00:03:05,00:03:06,"drinking opium-laced beer,"
00:03:06,00:03:08,"that was quite a good one, actually."
00:03:08,00:03:11,"There was a guy called Alberta's Magnus,"
00:03:11,00:03:13,"he was the Dominican scholar,"
00:03:13,00:03:15,"and he said, allowing insects to devour"
00:03:15,00:03:19,77 small cakes made from a dough
00:03:19,00:03:21,prepared by mixing flour and the patient's urine.
00:03:21,00:03:23,- Right.
00:03:23,00:03:25,"- Just on the beer one that you said,"
00:03:25,00:03:27,"well, no, no, no."
00:03:27,00:03:30,- Don't you kind of glossed over a slightly more?
00:03:30,00:03:33,"- A 77, allowing the flies to eat 77 small cakes."
00:03:33,00:03:35,- Can't be any insects.
00:03:35,00:03:37,"- Oh, fine, okay."
00:03:37,00:03:40,"Do you have to open a tiny gregs for them,"
00:03:40,00:03:43,which says we have urine cakes inside?
00:03:43,00:03:44,"- Can I just say for the people at gregs,"
00:03:44,00:03:47,"I'm sure you don't sell urine cakes, I've never..."
00:03:47,00:03:50,"They're never sponsoring us chains, we could say what we like."
00:03:50,00:03:51,(laughing)
00:03:51,00:03:54,"- Actually, Kate Guy was a guy called Alberta's Magnus,"
00:03:54,00:03:57,"wasn't it, who was, this guy in the 13th century"
00:03:57,00:03:58,"who came with loads of wacky cures,"
00:03:58,00:04:00,and another one of his familiaria was that
00:04:00,00:04:02,you could cut a chip off a block
00:04:02,00:04:04,"that a criminal had been executed on,"
00:04:04,00:04:06,and then rub it all over your body
00:04:06,00:04:07,if you were suffering from it.
00:04:07,00:04:09,"And that scared off the malaria,"
00:04:09,00:04:13,'cause it reminded it of the penalty for being evil.
00:04:13,00:04:15,"Reminded the evil malaria,"
00:04:15,00:04:17,that maybe it'll be hanged one day
00:04:17,00:04:18,if it doesn't go away.
00:04:18,00:04:19,"- And that's where we get the phrase,"
00:04:19,00:04:23,a chip off the old block on which a criminal was executed.
00:04:23,00:04:25,"- It is, exactly, yes."
00:04:25,00:04:27,- I've got a real cure for malaria.
00:04:27,00:04:28,- Okay.
00:04:28,00:04:30,"- Viagra, can fight malaria."
00:04:30,00:04:31,Did you know this? - Yeah.
00:04:31,00:04:35,"- So, okay, the malaria parasite, it gets into your body"
00:04:35,00:04:38,and it goes into red blood cells for a while.
00:04:38,00:04:40,"It spends a while in there in your bone marrow,"
00:04:40,00:04:43,"and the spleen's job is to filter out, you know,"
00:04:43,00:04:47,"old or dead or stiff red blood cells,"
00:04:47,00:04:51,and so the malaria normally sneakily passes through.
00:04:51,00:04:53,"However, and that means it spreads through the blood."
00:04:53,00:04:56,"However, if a patient takes Viagra,"
00:04:56,00:05:00,the infected blood cells themselves stiffen up.
00:05:00,00:05:03,(audience laughing)
00:05:03,00:05:06,- It literally makes your blood cells go stiff.
00:05:06,00:05:08,"- Yes, I know that, that, that, that, that, that."
00:05:08,00:05:10,- I knew that it made other things go stiff.
00:05:10,00:05:12,I just didn't know that it made the actual blood cells
00:05:12,00:05:13,in your body go stiff.
00:05:13,00:05:14,- I think it's true.
00:05:14,00:05:16,"- If you dilute Viagra and put it in a plant part,"
00:05:16,00:05:18,it makes a plant go stiff.
00:05:18,00:05:19,- Get away.
00:05:19,00:05:21,- I didn't know individual cells
00:05:21,00:05:23,getting individual little erections.
00:05:23,00:05:24,- Exactly.
00:05:24,00:05:26,"But it does, it will present the mosquitoes"
00:05:26,00:05:29,with a big target as well to go through.
00:05:29,00:05:31,"- How come when you eat Viagra then,"
00:05:31,00:05:32,it doesn't make a tongue stiff?
00:05:32,00:05:35,(audience laughing)
00:05:35,00:05:37,"- I think that, no, in fairness, that's quite a good point."
00:05:37,00:05:38,- That's a great point.
00:05:38,00:05:41,"- How come, basically, anyone who's taken Viagra"
00:05:41,00:05:43,the whole body just isn't completely stiff?
00:05:43,00:05:44,(audience laughing)
00:05:44,00:05:46,- I don't know.
00:05:46,00:05:48,"- Well, he gave it as a starfish."
00:05:48,00:05:49,- All right.
00:05:49,00:05:50,- I'm ready.
00:05:50,00:05:51,(audience laughing)
00:05:51,00:05:53,- But starfish have got five limbs
00:05:53,00:05:55,"and you've only got, oh no, yeah."
00:05:55,00:05:58,(audience laughing)
00:05:58,00:06:01,(audience applauding)
00:06:01,00:06:04,Anyway.
00:06:04,00:06:08,"Dr Butler, there was a famous doctor called Dr Butler,"
00:06:08,00:06:11,and his way of treating malaria was by dropping people
00:06:11,00:06:13,through a trap door on London Bridge
00:06:13,00:06:15,into the polluted river Thames.
00:06:15,00:06:18,- There used to be a trap door in London Bridge.
00:06:18,00:06:19,(audience laughing)
00:06:19,00:06:21,"- I mean, that's, I didn't think of that,"
00:06:21,00:06:22,"but yeah, that is where, isn't it?"
00:06:22,00:06:23,- Wow.
00:06:23,00:06:26,- So would he have to lure them onto the trap door?
00:06:26,00:06:28,- Would they know they're gonna be dropped
00:06:28,00:06:29,through the trap door?
00:06:29,00:06:31,"Or does he say, pay me the money?"
00:06:31,00:06:33,And I'll show you where the cure is.
00:06:33,00:06:34,(audience laughing)
00:06:34,00:06:35,It's just over here.
00:06:35,00:06:37,"- I think, it's a really good question."
00:06:37,00:06:37,I really don't know.
00:06:37,00:06:39,'Cause this guy wasn't great.
00:06:39,00:06:40,He had a habit of treating epilepsy
00:06:40,00:06:42,by firing a gun beside the victim's head.
00:06:42,00:06:45,(audience laughing)
00:06:45,00:06:47,- He was the physician to James I.
00:06:47,00:06:49,"So he was like, you know, he's a real deal."
00:06:49,00:06:51,"Well, no, he wasn't the real deal, but, you know."
00:06:51,00:06:52,"- But you said that like, James I first"
00:06:52,00:06:54,"who famously lived for 700 years,"
00:06:54,00:06:56,"like, how did he die?"
00:06:56,00:06:57,"26, malaria."
00:06:57,00:06:58,(audience laughing)
00:06:58,00:07:02,"Hey, do you know the oldest example of malaria"
00:07:02,00:07:05,that we found in a human that we have now?
00:07:05,00:07:06,- No.
00:07:06,00:07:07,- It's Tutankhamun.
00:07:07,00:07:08,- Is it?
00:07:08,00:07:11,"- Yeah, they've recently discovered a few years ago now"
00:07:11,00:07:14,"that Tutankhamun actually has types of,"
00:07:14,00:07:17,"not even one type, a few types of malaria inside him."
00:07:17,00:07:19,And that would have contributed
00:07:19,00:07:20,to his immune system going down.
00:07:20,00:07:22,"So they don't think it's what killed him,"
00:07:22,00:07:25,"but they think it's what, you know, added to his problems"
00:07:25,00:07:28,of his feet being bad and whatever it was.
00:07:28,00:07:29,We don't actually know what killed him.
00:07:29,00:07:31,"I think he was possibly crushed by a hippo,"
00:07:31,00:07:35,but it's possible that the malaria
00:07:35,00:07:37,"and not back the reflexes, it's possible."
00:07:37,00:07:39,- It's not possible.
00:07:39,00:07:42,"- Everything's possible, you know, maybe in the sarcophagus,"
00:07:42,00:07:43,"he was very, very flat."
00:07:43,00:07:45,(audience laughing)
00:07:45,00:07:47,"- He also had syphilis, didn't he?"
00:07:47,00:07:48,He had everything Tutankhamun.
00:07:48,00:07:51,"He was the first, he had the first socks and sandals,"
00:07:51,00:07:52,"I think, in the world."
00:07:52,00:07:54,"He just, always on it."
00:07:54,00:07:56,"In fact, malaria can cure syphilis."
00:07:56,00:07:59,So maybe he had malaria to cure his syphilis.
00:07:59,00:08:00,- That's possible.
00:08:00,00:08:02,- So this is a genuine thing.
00:08:02,00:08:04,"Yeah, someone won the Nobel Prize for this in,"
00:08:04,00:08:07,"this was in 1917 that it was discovered,"
00:08:07,00:08:11,and it was an Austrian physician called Julius Wagner-Jorreg.
00:08:11,00:08:13,And he realized that the fever that could be induced
00:08:13,00:08:16,by malaria was hot enough to cure syphilis.
00:08:16,00:08:18,"And so yeah, he got the Nobel Prize"
00:08:18,00:08:20,"and that was used until 1940, if you had syphilis,"
00:08:20,00:08:23,then you would be infected deliberately with malaria.
00:08:23,00:08:26,"- And don't worry, we've got some gonorrhea for the malaria."
00:08:26,00:08:27,(audience laughing)
00:08:27,00:08:30,And then we've got some dengue fever for the gonorrhea.
00:08:30,00:08:32,It's like the old woman who swallowed a fly.
00:08:32,00:08:33,(audience laughing)
00:08:33,00:08:35,That was infected with malaria.
00:08:35,00:08:36,(audience laughing)
00:08:36,00:08:39,"- There's a town, a city in fact in Australia"
00:08:39,00:08:42,"called Townsville and 7,000 families there"
00:08:42,00:08:45,have been nannying mosquitoes recently.
00:08:45,00:08:46,- This is what we mean by that.
00:08:46,00:08:47,- Within the last year or two.
00:08:47,00:08:49,So they've all hosted a tub of mosquito eggs
00:08:49,00:08:52,"in their backyard, and they've watered them"
00:08:52,00:08:56,and kept them nice and cool and moist and nurtured them.
00:08:56,00:08:58,Because those mosquitoes have all been infected
00:08:58,00:09:01,"with a bacteria, which means they're less able"
00:09:01,00:09:04,to transmit dengue and Zika viruses.
00:09:04,00:09:05,And they're the ones where you're gonna try
00:09:05,00:09:08,and get them to mate with the other mosquitoes.
00:09:08,00:09:09,- Exactly.
00:09:09,00:09:09,- Yeah.
00:09:09,00:09:12,"- So they're breeding millions and millions,"
00:09:12,00:09:13,and everyone in the town has agreed to it.
00:09:13,00:09:16,"They said, yeah, great, bring on the good mosquitoes."
00:09:16,00:09:17,- That is good.
00:09:17,00:09:18,- Yeah.
00:09:18,00:09:19,- It's a rubbish pet.
00:09:19,00:09:23,"If you ask for a dog, you've got 1,000 mosquitoes."
00:09:23,00:09:25,You're really pissed off.
00:09:25,00:09:27,"- And it's wrapped up under the tree in the shape of a dog,"
00:09:27,00:09:32,"but in fact, 2,000 mosquitoes."
00:09:32,00:09:34,"- I mean, you're never gonna wrap a dog are you?"
00:09:34,00:09:36,(laughing)
00:09:36,00:09:40,"- Well, people are trying to find malaria vaccines still."
00:09:40,00:09:43,And it seems to be habit to infect yourself
00:09:43,00:09:44,with malaria to work out what works.
00:09:44,00:09:48,"But also in the past, people infected other people."
00:09:48,00:09:50,"So, we often talk about self-experimentation"
00:09:50,00:09:52,and it's kind of these heroes who poison themselves
00:09:52,00:09:55,so they can work out how to cure themselves.
00:09:55,00:09:58,But there was a guy called Dr. Gracie in 1898
00:09:58,00:10:00,"who really wanted to work out,"
00:10:00,00:10:02,who really wanted to prove that malaria was caused
00:10:02,00:10:04,"by the Anophilese Mosquito, which it is."
00:10:04,00:10:06,And no one would believe him.
00:10:06,00:10:09,And so he got a volunteer called Mr. Solar
00:10:09,00:10:12,to be locked in a room in a tiny box
00:10:12,00:10:15,for 11 days filled with malaria infected mosquitoes
00:10:15,00:10:17,until he got one of the 11 days.
00:10:17,00:10:18,"- Yeah, it took, yeah."
00:10:18,00:10:19,"I mean, oh wow."
00:10:19,00:10:21,- And the sad thing is we know that he got malaria
00:10:21,00:10:23,because it was a successful experiment.
00:10:23,00:10:25,"So this guy, Dr. Gracie, was thrilled."
00:10:25,00:10:29,"He was like, now I've proven that the Mosquito cures malaria."
00:10:29,00:10:31,"And in his case notes, he writes,"
00:10:31,00:10:32,"""The rest of the history of Mr. Solar's case"
00:10:32,00:10:34,"""has no interest for us, but it is now certain"
00:10:34,00:10:36,"""that mosquitoes carry malaria."""
00:10:36,00:10:39,"So, oh my God. - Did not care, yeah."
00:10:39,00:10:39,- Wow.
00:10:39,00:10:43,"I was looking into the idea of all these old, you know,"
00:10:43,00:10:45,suggestions for how you cure things.
00:10:45,00:10:47,"So outside of malaria, there's everyone,"
00:10:47,00:10:49,every single disease seemed to have an eccentric thing
00:10:49,00:10:50,assigned to it.
00:10:50,00:10:54,"And one of my favorite ones is if you had swollen eyes,"
00:10:54,00:10:55,"the way that they suggested,"
00:10:55,00:10:57,"Dr. Suggested, that you cure it,"
00:10:57,00:11:02,"was that you tied a live crab to a necklace on your chest,"
00:11:02,00:11:04,and you just let it live there.
00:11:04,00:11:07,"And no, I mean, nobody will notice your swollen eyes"
00:11:07,00:11:08,ever again.
00:11:08,00:11:11,(laughing)
00:11:11,00:11:12,- You just tie it around your neck
00:11:12,00:11:15,and you just have a live crab and that will cure it.
00:11:15,00:11:16,- Cool.
00:11:16,00:11:19,I didn't know swollen eyes was really a thing.
00:11:19,00:11:21,"I was like, around the ear, so it's not swollen at all."
00:11:21,00:11:23,- It's thanks to the crap cure that was so successful.
00:11:23,00:11:25,That's why everyone's got normal eyes.
00:11:25,00:11:26,"- We wiped it out, yeah."
00:11:26,00:11:28,(laughing)
00:11:28,00:11:31,- I was just saying before about these mosquitoes
00:11:31,00:11:33,"in town, they're gonna send them out to have sex"
00:11:33,00:11:34,with other mosquitoes.
00:11:34,00:11:37,And I looked into how mosquitoes have sex.
00:11:37,00:11:40,"And one interesting thing I found is,"
00:11:40,00:11:42,it's the females that bite you.
00:11:42,00:11:44,"And so what some male mosquitoes will do,"
00:11:44,00:11:48,is they'll find a human and then just hang around the human
00:11:48,00:11:50,waiting for females to come.
00:11:50,00:11:51,- Wow.
00:11:51,00:11:53,- So like the human is just like a singles bar or something.
00:11:53,00:11:55,(laughing)
00:11:55,00:11:55,- That's so cool.
00:11:55,00:11:57,- So you might just have a little mosquito flying around
00:11:57,00:11:59,"and you're like, ""Oh God, say, can he's just waiting"
00:11:59,00:12:01,"for a bit of Lady Mosquito."""
00:12:01,00:12:02,- Wow.
00:12:02,00:12:05,- It's quite risky then landing on you though.
00:12:05,00:12:07,Going to that bar is a risky affair.
00:12:07,00:12:08,'Cause I didn't realize.
00:12:08,00:12:09,- That's the dating scene.
00:12:09,00:12:10,(laughing)
00:12:10,00:12:12,"- Oh, you gotta put yourself out there."
00:12:12,00:12:13,And they do.
00:12:13,00:12:15,But the reason they suck our blood is to feed their eggs.
00:12:15,00:12:17,So that's why it's only the females.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"But they, as soon as they've sucked it,"
00:12:19,00:12:21,they're so full they can't move anymore.
00:12:21,00:12:23,"So every time a mosquito is sucking on your blood,"
00:12:23,00:12:24,it's risking its own life.
00:12:24,00:12:25,'Cause if you spot it and spot it in time
00:12:25,00:12:27,"and that's why you often can,"
00:12:27,00:12:28,it can't really fly away.
00:12:28,00:12:30,It's got this giant sack of blood now inside it.
00:12:30,00:12:31,- Wow.
00:12:31,00:12:34,- It's actually really worse for them than it is for you.
00:12:34,00:12:35,- We're gonna have to move on in a second.
00:12:35,00:12:37,Or an X-Fact.
00:12:37,00:12:38,Do you wanna say something Andy or no?
00:12:38,00:12:40,"- It's just a follow-on fact from that, really."
00:12:40,00:12:42,"But it's not relevant enough to end this,"
00:12:42,00:12:43,to end the second.
00:12:43,00:12:44,"- No, no, no."
00:12:44,00:12:46,"- Well, man, bring it home."
00:12:46,00:12:46,- Oh God.
00:12:46,00:12:50,"It's not good, it's not good."
00:12:50,00:12:53,It's just that Mosquitoes are victims as much as we are
00:12:53,00:12:56,"because they're carrying the malaria parasite,"
00:12:56,00:12:58,but there's a theory that Mosquitoes
00:12:58,00:12:59,are actually made a bit crazy
00:12:59,00:13:01,by having the parasite inside them
00:13:01,00:13:04,and it makes them extra keen to suck blood.
00:13:04,00:13:05,"So they would do it anyway,"
00:13:05,00:13:09,but the parasite makes them basically like vampire mosquitoes.
00:13:09,00:13:10,- And the other thing is they get sick.
00:13:10,00:13:12,"Mosquitoes get sick, so it's a bit harsh on them."
00:13:12,00:13:15,"If they've got this malaria parasite there sick,"
00:13:15,00:13:18,"and also we blame them for kind of spreading it,"
00:13:18,00:13:19,but Mosquitoes don't get on airplanes
00:13:19,00:13:21,and fly around and stuff like that.
00:13:21,00:13:24,Mosquitoes stay near that little place where they live.
00:13:24,00:13:27,"What happens is humans get bitten, humans go somewhere else,"
00:13:27,00:13:30,"and they get bitten again and make a poor Mosquito sick,"
00:13:30,00:13:33,and then that Mosquito gets loads of other people sick.
00:13:33,00:13:35,So it's the humans who are doing all the spreading around.
00:13:35,00:13:36,"The poor Mosquitoes are just flying around,"
00:13:36,00:13:38,getting sick and then getting squashed.
00:13:38,00:13:39,- Oh.
00:13:39,00:13:42,- The real enemy is man.
00:13:42,00:13:44,(laughing)
00:13:48,00:13:51,(upbeat music)
00:13:51,00:13:54,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:13:54,00:13:55,and that is my fact.
00:13:55,00:13:57,"My fact this week is that,"
00:13:57,00:13:59,instead of commissioning new wax works
00:13:59,00:14:01,"for their exhibitions,"
00:14:01,00:14:03,the Bible Walk Museum in Ohio
00:14:03,00:14:07,repurposes discarded wax works from around the world instead.
00:14:07,00:14:10,"As a result, Abel is played by Prince Charles."
00:14:10,00:14:11,(audience laughing)
00:14:11,00:14:15,"King Solomon is played by John Travolta,"
00:14:15,00:14:17,and Jesus is played by Tom Cruise.
00:14:17,00:14:20,(audience laughing)
00:14:20,00:14:22,"And I encourage you to go online and look at these photos,"
00:14:22,00:14:26,'cause Tom Cruise makes a good-looking Jesus.
00:14:26,00:14:27,(laughing)
00:14:27,00:14:29,"- It is in baby Jesus, like Nativity scene."
00:14:29,00:14:30,(laughing)
00:14:30,00:14:33,"It is manger, and then you pull as little rug down,"
00:14:33,00:14:35,"and it's Tom Cruise's face, baby."
00:14:35,00:14:38,"- Yeah, it's Tom Cruise with the help it's ordered."
00:14:38,00:14:39,- Yeah.
00:14:39,00:14:40,"- Like a mission impossible,"
00:14:40,00:14:42,"the way he always pulls off the rubber mask,"
00:14:42,00:14:43,and it's Tom Cruise underneath.
00:14:43,00:14:45,You thought I was the baby Jesus?
00:14:45,00:14:46,"Well, you were wrong."
00:14:47,00:14:48,You're a really good boy.
00:14:48,00:14:52,"Yeah, so this is a very almost famous in American museum."
00:14:52,00:14:54,"The Bible Walk Museum, it was started"
00:14:54,00:14:57,by Pastor Richard Diamond in 1983.
00:14:57,00:15:01,He was inspired after he visited another wax museum.
00:15:01,00:15:05,"Not the greatest origin story, sort of expected or best."
00:15:05,00:15:08,"And he wanted to do it and tell the story of the Bible,"
00:15:08,00:15:11,but he realized how expensive it was to make new wax works.
00:15:11,00:15:14,So he thought there's a lot that are closing down all the time.
00:15:14,00:15:16,There's a lot that are selling them off at auction.
00:15:16,00:15:17,Let's just buy these.
00:15:17,00:15:19,"And they tend to be celebrities, so yeah."
00:15:19,00:15:21,"- That's the thing, like no one knows what Abel looked like."
00:15:21,00:15:22,Do they?
00:15:22,00:15:25,"He might look like Prince Charles, I don't know."
00:15:25,00:15:26,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:15:26,00:15:28,"They gave Prince Charles, when you see that photo,"
00:15:28,00:15:29,a sort of putting bowl haircut.
00:15:29,00:15:32,So they mess with the hair.
00:15:32,00:15:33,They don't leave the head untouched.
00:15:33,00:15:35,"They still dress them up, and they, yeah."
00:15:35,00:15:36,And it looks really good.
00:15:36,00:15:39,"And Steve McQueen is there, and George Harrison is there."
00:15:39,00:15:42,"And Marlon Brando, and Bert Lancaster, and Clark Gable."
00:15:42,00:15:43,"It's, yeah."
00:15:43,00:15:45,- That's an unbelievably cool selection of people.
00:15:45,00:15:46,You just listed.
00:15:46,00:15:48,"- You might be open with Prince Charles,"
00:15:48,00:15:50,and you've got your Clark Gables and your Steve McQueens.
00:15:50,00:15:51,Are they all the wise men?
00:15:51,00:15:53,"- No, they're all just random bit parts."
00:15:53,00:15:55,"There's no, they've got no starring roles."
00:15:55,00:15:57,Surely Jesus is a starring role
00:15:57,00:16:01,at a Biblically themed walkthrough wax work museum.
00:16:01,00:16:03,"- There are also, there are quite a few Jesuses in there,"
00:16:03,00:16:05,because it's all of Jesus' life and stuff like that.
00:16:05,00:16:08,"So at one stage, Prince Philip is being resurrected."
00:16:08,00:16:10,"- Prince Philip, yeah."
00:16:10,00:16:13,"- They've got the age of Jesus at resurrection wrong,"
00:16:13,00:16:18,"I think that's directly, so do people not mind that?"
00:16:18,00:16:19,"- No, they actively love it."
00:16:19,00:16:22,And that's the problem that the Biblically walked museum has
00:16:22,00:16:23,is that they don't like people liking that.
00:16:23,00:16:26,They think it takes away from the story of Jesus.
00:16:26,00:16:29,"So, if you call up, if anyone wants to visit them,"
00:16:29,00:16:31,"don't call up and say, hey, can you give us the celebrity"
00:16:31,00:16:33,"tour, they will not let you into the museum."
00:16:33,00:16:36,"They actively say, you're not coming now."
00:16:36,00:16:38,- Really?
00:16:38,00:16:39,- I think so.
00:16:39,00:16:40,(audience laughs)
00:16:40,00:16:42,"I'm pretty sure I read that, but they don't encourage that at all."
00:16:42,00:16:45,And they do think it takes away.
00:16:45,00:16:46,- I think they've got to make up their minds.
00:16:46,00:16:49,"Either be so stingy, you're going to repurpose"
00:16:49,00:16:52,tacky old wax works for your museum or fork out
00:16:52,00:16:53,"and don't complain about, you know?"
00:16:53,00:16:55,"I think if you're going to do it, embrace it."
00:16:55,00:16:58,"Like they did, in fact, so Madame Two Swords"
00:16:58,00:17:00,"did an activity thing in 2004,"
00:17:00,00:17:02,and they deliberately put loads of their
00:17:02,00:17:05,Madame Two Swords icons in the Nativity.
00:17:05,00:17:07,"And so it had the three wise men,"
00:17:07,00:17:09,"were Tony Blair, the Duke of Edinburgh,"
00:17:09,00:17:11,"again, and George Bush."
00:17:11,00:17:14,So this is all relevant to people.
00:17:14,00:17:15,"It was an ironic thing, I think."
00:17:15,00:17:19,Joseph and Mary were posh and becks.
00:17:19,00:17:20,- Oh.
00:17:20,00:17:21,- But this was really unpopular.
00:17:21,00:17:24,"- Yeah, it's going to say, did the Catholics"
00:17:24,00:17:25,and Christians not like that very much at that time?
00:17:25,00:17:26,- They did not like it at all.
00:17:26,00:17:28,"No, the Vatican spokesman in Britain said"
00:17:28,00:17:30,it was really disrespectful to Christianity.
00:17:30,00:17:33,And the exhibition actually closed before Christmas
00:17:33,00:17:36,"because someone got in, so cute, got their ticket,"
00:17:36,00:17:37,then went straight up to Joseph and Mary
00:17:37,00:17:38,and punched them in their face.
00:17:38,00:17:39,- Oh.
00:17:39,00:17:41,- Yeah.
00:17:41,00:17:41,- Wow.
00:17:41,00:17:43,"Do you know, just speaking of Madame Two Swords,"
00:17:43,00:17:46,"do you know what the wax work Tom Daly,"
00:17:46,00:17:49,"the diver, has that most other wax works."
00:17:49,00:17:52,"So anatomically, what he has that most other wax works don't have."
00:17:52,00:17:54,"- Well, he's very strong."
00:17:54,00:17:55,"Is he, does he have a six pack?"
00:17:55,00:17:57,- I'm sure he does.
00:17:57,00:17:58,- Yeah.
00:17:58,00:17:59,- But so does Prince Philip.
00:17:59,00:18:00,So that's not.
00:18:00,00:18:02,(laughing)
00:18:02,00:18:04,- I'm just trying to not go for the obvious.
00:18:04,00:18:05,- Does he have a lunch pack?
00:18:05,00:18:08,"- No, no, he doesn't."
00:18:08,00:18:10,"- Such a box, I think, is what it's called."
00:18:10,00:18:11,Are you sure?
00:18:11,00:18:12,"- I'm pretty sure, yeah, yeah."
00:18:12,00:18:13,- You confused me.
00:18:13,00:18:14,I thought you actually meant someone packed it.
00:18:14,00:18:15,- I'm sure.
00:18:15,00:18:17,- I don't think he doesn't have a pack lunch.
00:18:17,00:18:19,"- No, it's feet."
00:18:19,00:18:20,He has feet.
00:18:20,00:18:21,"What, the others don't have feet?"
00:18:21,00:18:23,- Most wax works just have the shoes
00:18:23,00:18:27,"and they have a very good sort of metal inside,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,almost like what you put a shoe horn into a shoe.
00:18:29,00:18:32,"So yeah, Donald Trump's wax work, for example,"
00:18:32,00:18:33,"definitely no feet, it's just his shoes."
00:18:33,00:18:35,"- Most of them, I think, you can get by"
00:18:35,00:18:38,just with head and hands.
00:18:38,00:18:39,"So after they've finished with,"
00:18:39,00:18:41,"so for example, what happened to David Cameron"
00:18:41,00:18:42,after he stopped being Prime Minister
00:18:42,00:18:44,was his Madame Tussauds' wax work
00:18:44,00:18:47,was decapitated and had his hands chopped off
00:18:47,00:18:50,"and they were kept in storage 'cause they, oh!"
00:18:50,00:18:52,(audience laughing)
00:18:52,00:18:53,Some applause.
00:18:53,00:18:56,I don't think we're in that divided country yet.
00:18:56,00:18:59,(audience laughing)
00:18:59,00:19:03,"So they never, they think is they never melt anyone down."
00:19:03,00:19:05,They never melt down a head or hands
00:19:05,00:19:06,'cause those are the most difficult fiddly
00:19:06,00:19:08,and the most personal bits to do.
00:19:08,00:19:09,"- Yeah, so it's kind of cheating."
00:19:09,00:19:10,"They're not making wax models,"
00:19:10,00:19:12,they're just making wax hands and a head.
00:19:12,00:19:13,- Or wax hands.
00:19:13,00:19:15,"- There's an amazing book about Madame Tussauds,"
00:19:15,00:19:19,which is by Pamela Pillbeam and I read a bit of it.
00:19:19,00:19:21,"In the 19th century, Madame Tussauds had a life orchestra"
00:19:21,00:19:23,playing as you walked around
00:19:23,00:19:26,and it was a really classy thing to do.
00:19:26,00:19:29,"You could touch anyone you liked, I'm pretty good."
00:19:29,00:19:31,But do you mean the models?
00:19:31,00:19:33,"'Cause it's gonna put off the violinist, isn't it?"
00:19:33,00:19:35,(audience laughing)
00:19:35,00:19:36,Fondle the orchestra.
00:19:36,00:19:39,"You're still hard to touch, Madame Tussauds."
00:19:39,00:19:40,I think that's the whole point.
00:19:40,00:19:41,- On the option.
00:19:41,00:19:42,- Are you?
00:19:42,00:19:43,- I think so.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"- I don't know, I haven't been for years."
00:19:44,00:19:46,"When I used to go, you weren't allowed to touch them,"
00:19:46,00:19:47,"but I think more recently, they've allowed you"
00:19:47,00:19:48,to kind of put your arms around them
00:19:48,00:19:50,and take selfies and stuff.
00:19:50,00:19:51,"- Yeah, I think we've mentioned before"
00:19:51,00:19:52,that they know that Brad Pitt
00:19:52,00:19:55,is the most groped of the wax works
00:19:55,00:19:56,at Madame Tussauds.
00:19:56,00:19:57,- Yeah.
00:19:57,00:19:58,- How do they know?
00:19:58,00:20:00,They have someone watching.
00:20:00,00:20:02,"- No, the reason they know is because it's the one"
00:20:02,00:20:04,that they need to replace most often.
00:20:04,00:20:05,"Because people keep touching it,"
00:20:05,00:20:08,so it keeps the trousers need replacing
00:20:08,00:20:09,and stuff like that.
00:20:09,00:20:10,- Yeah.
00:20:10,00:20:11,(audience laughing)
00:20:11,00:20:12,"- Oh, well, well."
00:20:12,00:20:14,"- Like I say, I haven't been for years."
00:20:14,00:20:16,(audience laughing)
00:20:16,00:20:17,Because I'm banned.
00:20:17,00:20:19,(audience laughing)
00:20:19,00:20:21,"But Tom Hardy, for instance,"
00:20:21,00:20:23,"the Tom Hardy model at Tussauds,"
00:20:23,00:20:27,"he has a beating heart and a soft, warm torso."
00:20:27,00:20:27,- What?
00:20:27,00:20:28,- What?
00:20:28,00:20:30,"- So if you weren't allowed to touch him,"
00:20:30,00:20:32,"there'd be no point having that, would there?"
00:20:32,00:20:32,- Yeah.
00:20:32,00:20:33,- Is it actually Tom Hardy?
00:20:33,00:20:38,"'Cause he is very still in a lot of his shows, anyway, isn't he?"
00:20:38,00:20:39,"- He's just had a lot of high anger,"
00:20:39,00:20:41,and he's stiffened him hard.
00:20:41,00:20:43,(audience laughing)
00:20:43,00:20:45,Arnold Schwarzenegger actually did that.
00:20:45,00:20:46,- Yeah.
00:20:46,00:20:48,"- Arnold Schwarzenegger, there was a thing he was promoting,"
00:20:48,00:20:50,"and for a stunt, he just stood in Madame Tussauds,"
00:20:50,00:20:51,"dressed up like the terminator, you know,"
00:20:51,00:20:53,"with the sort of metal showing through and injured,"
00:20:53,00:20:55,and then he would move and freak people out.
00:20:55,00:20:57,(audience laughing)
00:20:57,00:21:00,- Some of the religious kind of things
00:21:00,00:21:01,that you can go and see.
00:21:01,00:21:01,- Yeah.
00:21:01,00:21:04,"- The world's largest wooden construction,"
00:21:04,00:21:07,"so the largest wooden construction in the whole world,"
00:21:07,00:21:08,is Noah's Ark.
00:21:08,00:21:09,- Wow.
00:21:09,00:21:10,"- And it's a Noah's Ark in America,"
00:21:10,00:21:12,"it's called the Ark Encounter,"
00:21:12,00:21:17,"and it fits over 16,000 people simultaneously inside it."
00:21:17,00:21:19,"- But there are only supposed to be two, I thought."
00:21:19,00:21:22,(audience laughing)
00:21:22,00:21:25,"- What a space, they have a lot of space."
00:21:25,00:21:27,"And, well, actually, there are a few more humans"
00:21:27,00:21:28,"on Noah's Ark, wasn't there?"
00:21:28,00:21:29,"- Yeah, there were."
00:21:29,00:21:30,"- So there was Noah and his wife,"
00:21:30,00:21:33,"and there were his sons, so there was Shem."
00:21:33,00:21:35,- Ham.
00:21:35,00:21:37,- And the third one who has the more complicated name.
00:21:37,00:21:38,"Wait, someone knows it."
00:21:38,00:21:39,(audience laughing)
00:21:39,00:21:40,- Jedwood.
00:21:40,00:21:42,(audience laughing)
00:21:42,00:21:44,"- That was two by two as well, Jedwood, wasn't it?"
00:21:44,00:21:45,(audience laughing)
00:21:45,00:21:46,"- I'm sorry, I heard Jedwood,"
00:21:46,00:21:48,"because apparently in the Dublin Wax Museum,"
00:21:48,00:21:50,"you can have a Jedwood made,"
00:21:50,00:21:51,but and there are only two for one deal.
00:21:51,00:21:53,(audience laughing)
00:21:53,00:21:54,- Who wants it again?
00:21:54,00:21:56,- Jedwood. - JPEG.
00:21:56,00:21:57,- JPEG.
00:21:57,00:21:57,Okay.
00:21:57,00:21:59,(audience laughing)
00:21:59,00:22:03,"So, it was, it was Shem Ham and JPEG."
00:22:03,00:22:07,But the amazing thing is that this massive Noah's Ark
00:22:07,00:22:09,"was made by a guy called Ken Ham,"
00:22:09,00:22:12,which is the same name as someone I know as Ark.
00:22:12,00:22:15,He's quite famous in America as being an extremely
00:22:15,00:22:19,"pious Catholic, anti-evolutionary kind of guy."
00:22:19,00:22:21,"And Bill Nye, the science guy,"
00:22:21,00:22:23,"he went to see this Noah's Ark,"
00:22:23,00:22:25,"and he said on the third deck of the Ark,"
00:22:25,00:22:29,"""Every single science exhibit is absolutely wrong."""
00:22:29,00:22:30,(audience laughing)
00:22:30,00:22:32,"Not just misleading, but wrong."
00:22:32,00:22:33,(audience laughing)
00:22:33,00:22:34,"So yeah, it's completely bad."
00:22:34,00:22:35,"And then Ken Ham, by the way,"
00:22:35,00:22:37,"is trying to, this year and last year,"
00:22:37,00:22:39,trying to put the Jesus back into Halloween.
00:22:39,00:22:40,(audience laughing)
00:22:40,00:22:43,He's suggesting that people should go reverse trick
00:22:43,00:22:46,or treating where you bring the baskets of goodies
00:22:46,00:22:48,to bless your neighbors.
00:22:48,00:22:49,- And what if they don't want one?
00:22:49,00:22:52,You have to do something nice to them?
00:22:52,00:22:53,(audience laughing)
00:22:53,00:22:55,(audience laughing)
00:22:55,00:22:59,"- Well, good luck with that, Mr. Ham."
00:22:59,00:23:01,- Did you know that baby Jesus theft
00:23:01,00:23:02,has its own Wikipedia page?
00:23:02,00:23:03,(audience laughing)
00:23:03,00:23:05,- Is there much on it?
00:23:05,00:23:07,- It's jam-packs to the rafters.
00:23:07,00:23:10,"Yeah, so Jesus is always getting stolen at Christmas"
00:23:10,00:23:11,as it happens.
00:23:11,00:23:12,(audience laughing)
00:23:12,00:23:13,And then there's this list that's always going neck
00:23:13,00:23:15,from nativity scenes.
00:23:15,00:23:18,Marilyn Manson wants to stole a whole bunch of them.
00:23:18,00:23:19,"He admitted later, he stole a whole bunch of Jesus'"
00:23:19,00:23:22,and actually oddly replaced them with Ham's.
00:23:22,00:23:24,(audience laughing)
00:23:24,00:23:26,So maybe that was a tribute to Ken.
00:23:26,00:23:27,- Wow.
00:23:27,00:23:28,"- I was thinking Marilyn Manson,"
00:23:28,00:23:30,"did he not have a song called ""Personal Jesus""?"
00:23:30,00:23:31,- Did he?
00:23:31,00:23:32,"- No, he did, didn't he?"
00:23:32,00:23:33,"- So he's just going, ""That's my personal Jesus."""
00:23:33,00:23:34,(audience laughing)
00:23:34,00:23:35,"""That's my personal Jesus."""
00:23:35,00:23:38,"And actually, this is what you said earlier."
00:23:38,00:23:42,I read a quote from a historian of baby Jesus thefts
00:23:42,00:23:43,who (audience laughing)
00:23:43,00:23:45,he may have other strings to his boat
00:23:45,00:23:50,who's called Daniel Silliman and (audience laughing)
00:23:50,00:23:51,- Come on.
00:23:51,00:23:52,- Absolutely.
00:23:52,00:23:55,"Sorry, Silliman, what's your very serious paper"
00:23:55,00:23:56,about this time?
00:23:56,00:23:58,(audience laughing)
00:23:58,00:24:01,"Anyway, he said, ""Baby Jesus thieves literally"
00:24:01,00:24:04,"""take the Christ out of Christmas."""
00:24:04,00:24:05,- Oh.
00:24:05,00:24:07,- Which I think is worth reflecting on.
00:24:07,00:24:08,- Yeah.
00:24:08,00:24:10,"Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:24:10,00:24:12,and that is James.
00:24:12,00:24:14,"- Okay, my fact this week is that a giraffe"
00:24:14,00:24:17,with breathing problems can be treated
00:24:17,00:24:18,by using a leaf blower.
00:24:18,00:24:21,(audience laughing)
00:24:21,00:24:23,- Is it on suck or blow?
00:24:23,00:24:25,(audience laughing)
00:24:25,00:24:26,- I think it's on blow.
00:24:26,00:24:27,"- Or they're always on blow, aren't they?"
00:24:27,00:24:30,"- Leaf blower is generally, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:30,00:24:32,(audience laughing)
00:24:32,00:24:33,- Otherwise they'd be leaf suckers.
00:24:33,00:24:34,(audience laughing)
00:24:34,00:24:35,- My leaf blower sucks.
00:24:35,00:24:37,(audience laughing)
00:24:37,00:24:40,"So this, Andy was the only person"
00:24:40,00:24:43,"in the room who found that funny, which (audience laughing)"
00:24:43,00:24:45,"- So, where were you all?"
00:24:45,00:24:47,(audience laughing)
00:24:47,00:24:51,"- So, this is a 2007 paper by Cetano et al."
00:24:51,00:24:55,And what did al contributes to what he did?
00:24:55,00:24:58,(audience laughing)
00:24:58,00:25:00,- And what happened was they had to
00:25:00,00:25:03,"anesthetize a giraffe, but as anesthetized in it,"
00:25:03,00:25:04,"and then it had trouble breathing,"
00:25:04,00:25:08,and they managed to fix it by getting a gas powered leaf blower
00:25:08,00:25:10,and then attaching it to a few other parts
00:25:10,00:25:13,and managed to artificially ventilate this giraffe.
00:25:13,00:25:14,- By blowing into it's mouth?
00:25:14,00:25:16,- Through it's trickier and into it's lungs.
00:25:16,00:25:18,"- Wow. - Ooh, wow."
00:25:18,00:25:21,- And got all the leaves out of it's inside.
00:25:21,00:25:22,(audience laughing)
00:25:22,00:25:24,"- Yeah, well, copy's like, is anyone else hungry?"
00:25:24,00:25:27,(audience laughing)
00:25:27,00:25:29,- The thing I've always find weird about giraffes
00:25:29,00:25:31,"is that, I think we've done this on QI years ago,"
00:25:31,00:25:34,"is that when they were first spotted by the Romans,"
00:25:34,00:25:37,they called them the camel leopard.
00:25:37,00:25:39,"So they, someone saw a giraffe"
00:25:39,00:25:42,"and thought, what's the striking thing about this?"
00:25:42,00:25:44,"Well, it looks like it crossed me in a camel and a leopard."
00:25:44,00:25:47,"And in fact, he noted, this animal is like a camel"
00:25:47,00:25:51,"in all respects, except that its legs are not"
00:25:51,00:25:52,at the same length.
00:25:52,00:25:55,(audience laughing)
00:25:55,00:25:57,"- The skin is spotted like a leopard, so we're cool."
00:25:57,00:25:58,"I mean, what about the neck place?"
00:25:58,00:25:59,"- Yeah, nice."
00:25:59,00:26:01,- This is something that wasn't looking up.
00:26:01,00:26:02,"- You know, it was only until recently"
00:26:02,00:26:04,that we found out there was more than one giraffe.
00:26:04,00:26:07,"That was a, you mean, more than what species of giraffe?"
00:26:07,00:26:08,- Yeah.
00:26:08,00:26:09,(audience laughing)
00:26:09,00:26:11,"- Because actually if they were all studying a line,"
00:26:11,00:26:13,and you could only see the one right next to you.
00:26:13,00:26:16,"- Oh, yeah, I mean, there was more than one species."
00:26:16,00:26:20,"So we thought up until now that it was just giraffe,"
00:26:20,00:26:22,"and there was subspecies within giraffe,"
00:26:22,00:26:24,but now there's four.
00:26:24,00:26:24,- Wow.
00:26:24,00:26:25,"- And what there's always been,"
00:26:25,00:26:28,"but we've just suddenly been like, whoa, there's three more."
00:26:28,00:26:30,"- So there's a thing about their nerves,"
00:26:30,00:26:32,and it's a really annoying thing for them.
00:26:32,00:26:36,"It doesn't affect them too much, but so most vertebrates,"
00:26:36,00:26:38,"we have these things called a laryngeal nerves,"
00:26:38,00:26:40,and they help to send signals to all the organs in your body.
00:26:40,00:26:44,"And in all mammals, they branch off the vagus nerve,"
00:26:44,00:26:47,"that how it's pronounced, at vagus nerve."
00:26:47,00:26:48,"- Oh, that's good to know,"
00:26:48,00:26:51,because we mentioned that in this next episode
00:26:51,00:26:52,that's going on.
00:26:52,00:26:54,- And you're not going to like how we say it.
00:26:54,00:26:57,(audience laughing)
00:26:57,00:27:01,"So they branch off the vagus nerve,"
00:27:01,00:27:03,"and then one of them loops under the aorta,"
00:27:03,00:27:05,"and then back to the, is it larynx?"
00:27:05,00:27:08,(audience laughing)
00:27:08,00:27:11,(audience laughing)
00:27:11,00:27:13,"So then it loops back to the larynx,"
00:27:13,00:27:15,"and it's a bit awkward, but it's only a few inches longer"
00:27:15,00:27:17,in almost all mammals.
00:27:17,00:27:19,"Unfortunately, in giraffes, they've got these really long neck,"
00:27:19,00:27:22,so the nerve has to go on this massive detour
00:27:22,00:27:23,all the way down.
00:27:23,00:27:25,"So in humans, it's six inches long,"
00:27:25,00:27:27,"and it should only be about six inches long for giraffes,"
00:27:27,00:27:29,"but in giraffes, it's 15 feet long,"
00:27:29,00:27:30,"'cause it has to go all the way down the neck,"
00:27:30,00:27:31,and then back up.
00:27:31,00:27:32,"- Whoa, wow."
00:27:32,00:27:33,- And that's the nerve.
00:27:33,00:27:34,"- That's the nerve, yeah."
00:27:34,00:27:37,- So does that mean if you like slap a giraffe
00:27:37,00:27:40,"on the chest, then it won't feel it for ages."
00:27:40,00:27:42,"- Well, actually that is kind of true."
00:27:42,00:27:43,"So this is not the vagus nerve,"
00:27:43,00:27:44,but one of the other nerves.
00:27:44,00:27:49,So it takes a rat 4.5 milliseconds to respond to stimuli.
00:27:49,00:27:52,"If you stand on a rat's foot, it would take that long,"
00:27:52,00:27:54,"but a giraffe, it takes 100 milliseconds"
00:27:54,00:27:57,to sense a response to something.
00:27:57,00:27:58,"So like if you stand on a giraffe's foot,"
00:27:58,00:28:01,"it would take what, I don't know, 25 times longer."
00:28:01,00:28:02,- Wow.
00:28:02,00:28:04,"- So it'd be very dangerous drivers, wouldn't they?"
00:28:04,00:28:06,(audience laughing)
00:28:06,00:28:07,- Very slow reactions.
00:28:07,00:28:09,(audience laughing)
00:28:09,00:28:11,"And also, you'd have to cut a hole"
00:28:11,00:28:12,and top of your car.
00:28:12,00:28:13,(audience laughing)
00:28:13,00:28:15,"It was, I think, the first giraffe that came over here,"
00:28:15,00:28:19,"or the really famous giraffe that came to Britain in 1827,"
00:28:19,00:28:21,"I think it was, came apparently in a boat"
00:28:21,00:28:24,where they had to have a hole drilled in the deck of the boat
00:28:24,00:28:25,so that it could travel.
00:28:25,00:28:27,"- Well, that was to France, wasn't it?"
00:28:27,00:28:29,"- There were three, and they were given"
00:28:29,00:28:31,"by the visor of Egypt, weren't they?"
00:28:31,00:28:33,And it was sort of like dealing cards.
00:28:33,00:28:34,"He gave three giraffes, one to Britain,"
00:28:34,00:28:36,"one to France, one to Austria,"
00:28:36,00:28:40,"and bizarrely, they were transported from Egypt"
00:28:40,00:28:44,over to Western Europe on the backs of camels.
00:28:44,00:28:44,- Yeah.
00:28:44,00:28:45,- What?
00:28:45,00:28:46,- Yeah.
00:28:46,00:28:47,- They were strapped to camel.
00:28:47,00:28:49,"- They were, they were, they were small when they started."
00:28:49,00:28:50,"They were, they were young giraffes when they started."
00:28:50,00:28:51,"- Ah, alright."
00:28:51,00:28:53,"- So for the first stage, they were put in a camel."
00:28:53,00:28:54,- Ah.
00:28:54,00:28:55,- So how long was the trip though?
00:28:55,00:28:56,"That's a long, it was, it's so long."
00:28:56,00:28:59,It took two and a half years to get them from Sudan
00:28:59,00:29:01,"to, no wonder, to the, trick the camel to begin with,"
00:29:01,00:29:03,"by going, this guy's tiny, he'll be fine."
00:29:03,00:29:04,(audience laughing)
00:29:04,00:29:07,"One year in, this guy's, what the fuck is this?"
00:29:07,00:29:09,(audience laughing)
00:29:09,00:29:12,"This guy's just like me, but we're slightly longer legs."
00:29:12,00:29:15,(audience laughing)
00:29:15,00:29:17,- It was amazing though.
00:29:17,00:29:21,"They, so the one that went to France was called Zeraffa,"
00:29:21,00:29:25,and Zeraffa had three nannies who were all cows.
00:29:25,00:29:26,- Yes.
00:29:26,00:29:29,- Because he needed six gallons of milk every day
00:29:29,00:29:30,to keep growing.
00:29:30,00:29:31,- Yeah.
00:29:31,00:29:31,- Wow.
00:29:31,00:29:33,- So these cows all went along for the ride as well.
00:29:33,00:29:35,"- So wet nurse nannies, rather than,"
00:29:35,00:29:37,it wasn't nannies who played with him with rattles
00:29:37,00:29:41,"and stuff, was like, they suckled at the cows' teeth."
00:29:41,00:29:43,They must have had a massive identity crisis
00:29:43,00:29:44,by the time they arrived.
00:29:44,00:29:45,- They suckled the cows' teeth.
00:29:45,00:29:46,"- Yeah, they suckled."
00:29:46,00:29:48,- How do you suck a lot of cows' teeth?
00:29:48,00:29:51,"Is it's cow really, really high and still, so something?"
00:29:51,00:29:53,- The cow is on the back of a huge donkey.
00:29:53,00:29:55,(audience laughing)
00:29:55,00:29:57,"- Yeah, maybe they put the cow on stills,"
00:29:57,00:29:59,"I don't know, it's not like a lot of effort to go to,"
00:29:59,00:30:00,but they suckled the cows.
00:30:00,00:30:01,- Wow.
00:30:01,00:30:02,- Yeah.
00:30:02,00:30:04,"- We think that we thought, until recently,"
00:30:04,00:30:06,that giraffes were loners.
00:30:06,00:30:07,"And now, apparently, it turns out,"
00:30:07,00:30:09,they can just see each other from further away.
00:30:09,00:30:10,(audience laughing)
00:30:10,00:30:12,"- And they genuinely, so..."
00:30:12,00:30:13,- But they couldn't talk to each other
00:30:13,00:30:14,"from that distance, could they?"
00:30:14,00:30:17,"- They can communicate from a fair,"
00:30:17,00:30:18,I think from about a hundred feet away.
00:30:18,00:30:20,"They can, 'cause they have infrastructure today."
00:30:20,00:30:23,- I think they can harm at volumes that we can't.
00:30:23,00:30:25,"- Well, no, they've been here."
00:30:25,00:30:27,"- Yeah, we've been for centuries."
00:30:27,00:30:28,I've been trying to work out how they communicate
00:30:28,00:30:31,"through voice, because they don't really hear"
00:30:31,00:30:33,"giraffes communicating, so they think house is done."
00:30:33,00:30:36,"And in zoos, they did a study to see whether or not"
00:30:36,00:30:39,they could capture them talking to each other.
00:30:39,00:30:41,And the conclusion is that they have found them
00:30:41,00:30:42,"talking to each other at night,"
00:30:42,00:30:44,"and it is through, as you say, hums."
00:30:44,00:30:45,"So they hear these hums,"
00:30:45,00:30:47,"and they're done in different patterns and so on,"
00:30:47,00:30:49,so they think they're talking to each other.
00:30:49,00:30:52,There's a slight thought that it could also be them snoring.
00:30:52,00:30:53,They're not sure.
00:30:53,00:30:54,(audience laughing)
00:30:54,00:30:56,'Cause it's curious that they do it only at night.
00:30:56,00:30:57,"- Maybe it's one of them snoring,"
00:30:57,00:30:58,"and the other one's saying,"
00:30:58,00:31:00,"""Can you just turn over, please?"""
00:31:00,00:31:02,(audience laughing)
00:31:02,00:31:03,- That's it.
00:31:03,00:31:05,- Do you know the weirdest thing about giraffes
00:31:05,00:31:07,are of all quadrupeds.
00:31:07,00:31:11,They're the only known ones that can't swim naturally.
00:31:11,00:31:14,So every single four-legged animal you've ever seen
00:31:14,00:31:16,"is a natural swimmer, and so not like we are,"
00:31:16,00:31:18,"we have to learn to swim if you drop a baby in the water,"
00:31:18,00:31:21,"it will sink, same with an ape, which actually they did."
00:31:21,00:31:23,"I think in the early 20th century,"
00:31:23,00:31:26,"they retrieved them, but they dropped lots of monkeys"
00:31:26,00:31:28,"into water, watched them for a while,"
00:31:28,00:31:30,"and they all flailed, and then sank quite quickly,"
00:31:30,00:31:32,then they got them out again.
00:31:32,00:31:34,"- Do when you live by the ocean,"
00:31:34,00:31:36,"as in I'm just wondering if they live inland,"
00:31:36,00:31:37,"it's only lakes, they're probably tall enough,"
00:31:37,00:31:40,"they've never had to learn to swim, 'cause they're next around."
00:31:40,00:31:42,"- Maybe, crossing a river,"
00:31:42,00:31:44,"you can just walk across the riverbed, aren't you?"
00:31:44,00:31:47,"- Well, you don't know until you try."
00:31:47,00:31:49,"As in, you don't know that a giraffe can't tell"
00:31:49,00:31:51,the depth of the river by just looking at it.
00:31:51,00:31:53,"They'll come a point where you're walking into the river,"
00:31:53,00:31:54,"and you think, ""This is fine, this is fine,"
00:31:54,00:31:55,"""this is not fine."""
00:31:55,00:31:57,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:31:57,00:32:00,"- But then you're the exciting explorer,"
00:32:00,00:32:01,"and then the rest of going, ""All right, Mike didn't make it,"
00:32:01,00:32:02,"""let's find another way."""
00:32:02,00:32:04,(laughing)
00:32:04,00:32:06,We're gonna have to move on shortly.
00:32:06,00:32:10,"Just quickly, I found the fact about leaf blowers"
00:32:10,00:32:14,"and animals, so your fact was a giraffe"
00:32:14,00:32:16,with breathing problems can be treated using a leaf blower.
00:32:16,00:32:18,"I have to admit, and this is genuinely true,"
00:32:18,00:32:20,"right until you said it tonight, I misread it."
00:32:20,00:32:22,I thought you said a giraffe with breathing problems
00:32:22,00:32:24,can be used as a leaf blower.
00:32:24,00:32:26,(laughing)
00:32:26,00:32:28,"Honestly, as you read it tonight,"
00:32:28,00:32:31,they're the one giraffes that can't be used to blow leaves.
00:32:31,00:32:34,"I thought that's what it was,"
00:32:34,00:32:35,so I looked into other animals
00:32:35,00:32:36,that can be used as a leaf blower.
00:32:36,00:32:38,(laughing)
00:32:38,00:32:42,- I think we do need to interrogate for a second
00:32:42,00:32:45,how you thought a giraffe was gonna be used as a leaf blower.
00:32:45,00:32:48,"Was it like, when you play wheelbarrow at school in races,"
00:32:48,00:32:50,"you hold its legs, but it's nose to the ground?"
00:32:50,00:32:51,"- Yeah, I turn out, 'cause the only,"
00:32:51,00:32:53,"I thought it was a bit of a cruel fact to use, to be honest."
00:32:53,00:32:57,"I was, 'cause I thought they must have this sort of push"
00:32:57,00:32:58,"that with a break in between, 'cause it's like a wheeze,"
00:32:58,00:33:00,"and they probably lean over because it's hurting,"
00:33:00,00:33:03,"so they're going, they're like, wow, this is really effective"
00:33:03,00:33:06,"in zoos, let's walk the giraffe around"
00:33:06,00:33:09,"with the breathing problems, and let's clean this place up."
00:33:09,00:33:13,"Anyway, so elephants also use their trunks"
00:33:13,00:33:16,"as a makeshift leaf blower, as it were."
00:33:16,00:33:17,- Don't say all so.
00:33:17,00:33:19,(laughing)
00:33:20,00:33:23,(laughing)
00:33:23,00:33:25,"- So elephants, they have this thing."
00:33:25,00:33:29,"- Where if they're in vicinity of inaccessible food,"
00:33:29,00:33:32,"because a bit too tight for them to get to the food,"
00:33:32,00:33:34,what they do is they blow at the food
00:33:34,00:33:36,"if there's some sort of tree or wall, let's say,"
00:33:36,00:33:39,"that's in the way, and it bounces the food off it"
00:33:39,00:33:42,"and back towards them, and that's how they can get their food."
00:33:42,00:33:44,And this is something we've been observing about elephants
00:33:44,00:33:46,"for a very long time, in fact,"
00:33:46,00:33:47,"in the descent of man by Charles Darwin,"
00:33:47,00:33:51,he writes about the leaf blowing that wasn't invented then.
00:33:51,00:33:54,"So, way ahead of his time, Charles Darwin."
00:33:54,00:33:56,"- It's interesting, 'cause it's a bit like them using tools,"
00:33:56,00:33:59,"isn't it, because they've basically solved a problem"
00:33:59,00:34:01,"to be able to get food closer to them,"
00:34:01,00:34:02,which I think is really cool.
00:34:02,00:34:03,"- Yeah, it's really amazing."
00:34:03,00:34:05,- I was looking at a few other weird things
00:34:05,00:34:08,"that Vets had done, and just this one thing I found,"
00:34:08,00:34:09,"which I really liked, it's not quite that,"
00:34:09,00:34:13,"but there was a spiny antita called Matilda,"
00:34:13,00:34:18,"who had inflamed skin, bald patches, and bulging puffy eyes."
00:34:18,00:34:21,And it turned out that she was allergic to ants.
00:34:21,00:34:24,- Wow. - She's an antita allergic to ants.
00:34:24,00:34:26,"And actually, yeah. - Where's your puffy eyes?"
00:34:26,00:34:27,"- Puffy eyes, yeah."
00:34:27,00:34:28,- They should have just put a live crab.
00:34:28,00:34:31,(audience laughing)
00:34:31,00:34:35,"Around the neck, problem solved."
00:34:35,00:34:37,"- They made a vaccine for her, that's it."
00:34:37,00:34:38,"- Oh, okay."
00:34:38,00:34:41,"Okay, time for our final fact of the show,"
00:34:41,00:34:43,and that is Andy.
00:34:43,00:34:46,"My fact is that when 3,000 British teenagers"
00:34:46,00:34:49,"were surveyed in 2008, 20% said that they thought"
00:34:49,00:34:51,Winston Churchill was a fictional character.
00:34:51,00:34:54,(audience laughing)
00:34:54,00:34:55,"- They can all vote now, can't they?"
00:34:55,00:34:56,- Yep.
00:34:56,00:34:59,(audience laughing)
00:34:59,00:35:02,"So, and this is just sort of, you know,"
00:35:02,00:35:04,"things that gets thrown up by opinion polls,"
00:35:04,00:35:06,so the same poll found that 27% thought
00:35:06,00:35:09,"that Florence Nightingale had never existed,"
00:35:09,00:35:12,"and the 47% thought that Richard the Lionheart was fictional,"
00:35:12,00:35:13,"which I can kind of understand,"
00:35:13,00:35:15,"'cause that sounds like it. - Yeah, it sounds like it."
00:35:15,00:35:16,- Sounds like it.
00:35:16,00:35:18,"- Sounds maybe happy, doesn't Richard the Lionheart, yeah, sure."
00:35:18,00:35:21,But 47% thought that Eleanor Rigby was real.
00:35:21,00:35:23,- Oh. - So.
00:35:23,00:35:24,"- Well, there wasn't real one, was there?"
00:35:24,00:35:25,"- Yeah, I mean, in a way she was,"
00:35:25,00:35:29,because Paul McCartney did see the name Eleanor Rigby
00:35:29,00:35:31,"on a tombstone, he didn't know her, or her story,"
00:35:31,00:35:35,"but there was, well, 47% of British teenagers in 2008"
00:35:35,00:35:37,knew that Beatles arcane anecdote.
00:35:37,00:35:39,(audience laughing)
00:35:39,00:35:41,"There was a month later, they did another survey,"
00:35:41,00:35:43,and one in three primary school pupils thought
00:35:43,00:35:45,that he was the first man to walk on the moon
00:35:45,00:35:46,when it's the Churchill.
00:35:46,00:35:48,"Cool. - Well, I think a lot of these things,"
00:35:48,00:35:51,"it must be like, they just give you a name of a person,"
00:35:51,00:35:53,"they go, real or not real, and you just go,"
00:35:53,00:35:54,I don't know. - Yeah.
00:35:54,00:35:55,"- Especially at primary school,"
00:35:55,00:35:56,"you don't care what you're crossing,"
00:35:56,00:35:58,you're just excited someone's giving you a felt tip.
00:35:58,00:36:02,(audience laughing)
00:36:02,00:36:03,"- But so, they, just bringing up moon,"
00:36:03,00:36:06,"it's not as if they think he's fictional,"
00:36:06,00:36:08,"as in it's a conspiracy that he was invented as an idea,"
00:36:08,00:36:09,"'cause you know there was all that stuff,"
00:36:09,00:36:12,"about the fact that we'll fight them on the beaches,"
00:36:12,00:36:14,"was said by someone else, a voice actor."
00:36:14,00:36:15,"Which is not true, I don't think,"
00:36:15,00:36:18,but there was an idea that he had never...
00:36:18,00:36:19,"- It is true, there was a voice actor."
00:36:19,00:36:21,"- Yeah, yeah, it was a voice actor."
00:36:21,00:36:23,"The famous recording that we have,"
00:36:23,00:36:24,"or many of the famous recordings that we have,"
00:36:24,00:36:26,"in fact, of Winston Churchill,"
00:36:26,00:36:28,I think we're recorded after the war.
00:36:28,00:36:29,"- Churchill himself did a few in a studio,"
00:36:29,00:36:32,but there are broadcasts which were done by a voice actor.
00:36:32,00:36:32,"- Okay, right."
00:36:32,00:36:34,"You know, he has been a fictional character"
00:36:34,00:36:35,"in some respects. - Okay, yes."
00:36:35,00:36:38,"- I went on to Comic Thine website,"
00:36:38,00:36:41,and found that there's 164 comic books
00:36:41,00:36:43,with Winston Churchill as a character in them.
00:36:43,00:36:44,- Wow.
00:36:44,00:36:46,"- He's been in Star Trek, Comic, Eagle, Justice League,"
00:36:46,00:36:49,"Super Buy, Captain America, Green Lantern,"
00:36:49,00:36:52,and Santa Claus versus the Nazis.
00:36:52,00:36:53,(audience laughing)
00:36:53,00:36:54,- Wow.
00:36:54,00:36:55,They're the main ones.
00:36:55,00:36:58,- He wasn't very good in studies.
00:36:58,00:37:00,"I mean, I know there's a thing that's often said about Churchill,"
00:37:00,00:37:02,but I do think it's quite reassuring
00:37:02,00:37:04,when you realize how bad he was at school.
00:37:04,00:37:05,- So he failed basically everything
00:37:05,00:37:07,that he didn't like except history in English.
00:37:07,00:37:10,He failed his entrance exam to university twice
00:37:10,00:37:11,"or to the Royal Military College,"
00:37:11,00:37:14,which I don't think was that hard to get into.
00:37:14,00:37:15,But he failed that twice.
00:37:15,00:37:17,"- Well, he failed everything except history in English."
00:37:17,00:37:19,"- Oh, he did very badly in it."
00:37:19,00:37:20,"Yeah. - Okay, but history in English"
00:37:20,00:37:21,was two best ones.
00:37:21,00:37:22,"- I think so, yeah."
00:37:22,00:37:24,"- And then later on, he won the Nobel Prize for Literature"
00:37:24,00:37:28,"and defeated Nazis, history, and English."
00:37:28,00:37:29,(audience laughing)
00:37:29,00:37:31,"- So what we're saying, kids, is specialize."
00:37:31,00:37:32,- Yeah.
00:37:32,00:37:34,(audience laughing)
00:37:34,00:37:36,"- If you know good at French, fuck it."
00:37:36,00:37:39,(audience laughing)
00:37:39,00:37:42,(audience laughing)
00:37:42,00:37:43,- Is that what we're saying?
00:37:43,00:37:46,(audience laughing)
00:37:46,00:37:49,- How do we are that divided a country after all?
00:37:49,00:37:51,"- You're in Roosevelt, FDR, I first met him."
00:37:51,00:37:53,He first met him in 1918.
00:37:53,00:37:55,So I would have been just after he'd come out
00:37:55,00:37:56,from fighting the First World War
00:37:56,00:37:58,and they were on a diplomatic mission
00:37:58,00:38:00,and he met Churchill as a soldier
00:38:00,00:38:03,"and called him a stinker, hated him."
00:38:03,00:38:04,- So they obviously became really close
00:38:04,00:38:05,"in the Second World War, but the only thing he said"
00:38:05,00:38:08,"about what it's in Churchill was, what a stinker."
00:38:08,00:38:09,- What does stinker mean in that?
00:38:09,00:38:12,Does it mean just a bad person or like actually smirk?
00:38:12,00:38:13,- It means a stinker. - Oh really?
00:38:13,00:38:15,"- What is, you're a stinker, you know,"
00:38:15,00:38:17,"like in a playground, if you call someone a stinker,"
00:38:17,00:38:19,"then-- - I know, not only too well."
00:38:19,00:38:22,(audience laughing)
00:38:22,00:38:23,Oh.
00:38:23,00:38:25,(audience laughing)
00:38:25,00:38:29,So Churchill first became famous in the Boer War
00:38:29,00:38:31,"as a reporter, didn't he?"
00:38:31,00:38:33,"But then as a correspondent, he got captured"
00:38:33,00:38:36,and he had to escape and then the tales of his escape
00:38:36,00:38:38,"became really, really famous."
00:38:38,00:38:40,"But when he did escape, they raised the alarm"
00:38:40,00:38:42,and they gave a description of him
00:38:42,00:38:43,so they could find him.
00:38:43,00:38:45,"And they said, ""Escape to Prisoner of War,"
00:38:45,00:38:49,"Winston Spencer Churchill, Englishman, 25 years old,"
00:38:49,00:38:52,"""about five foot eight inches tall, medium build,"
00:38:52,00:38:55,"""walks with a slight stoop, pale features,"
00:38:55,00:38:59,"""reddish brown hair, almost invisible, small mustache,"
00:38:59,00:39:03,"""speaks through his nose, cannot pronounce the letter S,"
00:39:03,00:39:06,"""and cannot speak one word of Dutch."""
00:39:06,00:39:08,"- Oh, wow. - And that's your great Winston Churchill."
00:39:08,00:39:09,- Oh. - Yeah?
00:39:09,00:39:12,"- Almost invisible, small mustache."
00:39:12,00:39:13,"Wait, you there, stop."
00:39:13,00:39:17,"No, that's too visible, a small mustache."
00:39:17,00:39:18,You're free to go.
00:39:18,00:39:19,(audience laughing)
00:39:19,00:39:21,"- That was Hitler, wasn't it, in that respect?"
00:39:21,00:39:24,(audience laughing)
00:39:24,00:39:27,"- Can I tell you just a really quick Churchill thing,"
00:39:27,00:39:28,"there's quite tangentially related,"
00:39:28,00:39:31,but this was actually one of our researchers
00:39:31,00:39:34,sent me the book with us in the other day.
00:39:34,00:39:37,"And it's that Winston Churchill had a son-in-law,"
00:39:37,00:39:41,"Duncan Sandis, who was a minister for a brief time in the '60s."
00:39:41,00:39:44,"And basically, Winston Churchill's son-in-law was forced"
00:39:44,00:39:47,by Harold McMillan's government to go to the doctor
00:39:47,00:39:51,to have his penis compared to a penis in a salacious photo
00:39:51,00:39:53,to prove that it wasn't the same penis.
00:39:53,00:39:55,And it's just such a good story.
00:39:55,00:39:57,So there was this huge ruckus in the early '60s
00:39:57,00:40:00,because someone was caught having a blowjob
00:40:00,00:40:02,given to them by a Dutchess.
00:40:02,00:40:04,And their head wasn't in the picture.
00:40:04,00:40:06,So you can only see the other regions.
00:40:06,00:40:08,And it was gonna be this huge scandal.
00:40:08,00:40:09,And everyone said it's this guy.
00:40:09,00:40:11,"It's the minister of defense, Duncan Sandis."
00:40:11,00:40:13,"And so he eventually had to go,"
00:40:13,00:40:16,he was made to go to Harley Street by the government
00:40:16,00:40:18,with this photo in one hand and this willy in the other.
00:40:18,00:40:20,(audience laughing)
00:40:20,00:40:22,- How did he ring the bell?
00:40:22,00:40:25,(audience laughing)
00:40:25,00:40:28,(audience laughing)
00:40:28,00:40:33,"- Anyway, they confirmed it wasn't the same penis."
00:40:33,00:40:34,- Wow.
00:40:34,00:40:36,- We should talk as well about surveys
00:40:36,00:40:40,"'cause surveys, they always bring up the weirdest"
00:40:40,00:40:43,of revelations about what people think around the world.
00:40:43,00:40:45,I really like that.
00:40:45,00:40:48,There was a survey done about what we think sci-fi things
00:40:48,00:40:50,are real and not real that we hear about.
00:40:50,00:40:53,"So, for example, over a fifth of adults,"
00:40:53,00:40:56,"and this was in Birmingham, did this as a survey."
00:40:56,00:40:58,Over a fifth of adults incorrectly believe
00:40:58,00:41:01,that lightsabers exist as a real thing.
00:41:01,00:41:05,"Nearly a quarter, 24% of people believe"
00:41:05,00:41:07,that humans can be teleporters.
00:41:07,00:41:08,(audience laughing)
00:41:08,00:41:09,That's quite cool.
00:41:09,00:41:12,40% believe that hoverboards exist.
00:41:12,00:41:12,"I mean, it's a--"
00:41:12,00:41:14,- I think they didn't invent a hoverboard.
00:41:14,00:41:16,'Cause I thought they invented the world's first hoverboard
00:41:16,00:41:17,a couple of years ago.
00:41:17,00:41:19,- They also had those really rubbish
00:41:19,00:41:21,kind of things on two wheels that like a segway
00:41:21,00:41:23,without the stick and they were called hoverboards.
00:41:23,00:41:24,Maybe I'm thinking of that.
00:41:24,00:41:26,They didn't invent one.
00:41:26,00:41:27,I think it might have been a bit rubbish.
00:41:27,00:41:30,- 11% of teenagers think that fruit pastels
00:41:30,00:41:31,count as one of your five a day.
00:41:31,00:41:33,- Which color?
00:41:33,00:41:34,- Any color?
00:41:34,00:41:35,- Any color.
00:41:35,00:41:36,- They're all fruit.
00:41:36,00:41:37,- They're all fruit.
00:41:37,00:41:39,"- Well, fruit and meat pastels, are they?"
00:41:39,00:41:42,(audience laughing)
00:41:42,00:41:44,Although I've just had an amazing idea.
00:41:44,00:41:47,(audience laughing)
00:41:47,00:41:51,"- Well, 11.5 tubes of fruit pastels"
00:41:51,00:41:54,would give you about as much vitamin C as a piece of fruit.
00:41:54,00:41:58,- So Yugav do obviously loads and loads and loads of pulse
00:41:58,00:42:00,"and they build up these huge, you know,"
00:42:00,00:42:03,"crunching amounts of data based on, you know,"
00:42:03,00:42:05,just they pick one thing that people divide into
00:42:05,00:42:06,like right-handed or left-handed
00:42:06,00:42:08,and then they can find out massive amounts
00:42:08,00:42:09,about the tendencies.
00:42:09,00:42:11,"So Yugav surveys have found,"
00:42:11,00:42:13,"and they've sort of crunched the loaded numbers together,"
00:42:13,00:42:16,that a quarter of leave voters like their stakes well done
00:42:16,00:42:20,but only 12% of remain voters like their stakes well done.
00:42:20,00:42:22,More leave voters than remain voters
00:42:22,00:42:25,think that Doctor Who votes conservative.
00:42:25,00:42:26,(audience laughing)
00:42:26,00:42:28,- Remain voters think you would probably vote green.
00:42:28,00:42:30,(audience laughing)
00:42:30,00:42:31,- She.
00:42:31,00:42:32,- Oh.
00:42:32,00:42:33,(audience laughing)
00:42:33,00:42:36,"- Well thanks a bunch, Shoez, I've got up to Chris Ackelston."
00:42:36,00:42:39,(audience laughing)
00:42:39,00:42:45,"- Well, get ready to be angry."
00:42:45,00:42:49,(audience laughing)
00:42:49,00:42:51,"- Um, I found this amazing."
00:42:51,00:42:54,There was a survey done last year
00:42:54,00:42:58,that found 35% of French people cannot name
00:42:58,00:43:00,the French Prime Minister.
00:43:00,00:43:01,- What?
00:43:01,00:43:02,"- Which, I mean, can you?"
00:43:02,00:43:03,- No.
00:43:03,00:43:04,(audience laughing)
00:43:04,00:43:04,- The French Prime Minister.
00:43:04,00:43:06,- Who the President is Macron?
00:43:06,00:43:07,"- Yes, indeed."
00:43:07,00:43:09,"- Does that get, is that what the half point?"
00:43:09,00:43:11,- You don't get bonus points for naming that cross.
00:43:11,00:43:13,- This is the worst pub quiz I've ever been to.
00:43:13,00:43:14,(audience laughing)
00:43:14,00:43:15,- So who is it?
00:43:15,00:43:16,- It's a guy called Edward Philippe.
00:43:16,00:43:17,- I have to say I'd never heard of it.
00:43:17,00:43:18,- I could have guessed that.
00:43:18,00:43:20,I would have said two random French names.
00:43:20,00:43:21,It got pretty close.
00:43:21,00:43:23,(audience laughing)
00:43:23,00:43:25,- He's not incredible more than a third.
00:43:25,00:43:27,I don't know that own Prime Minister is.
00:43:27,00:43:29,Apparently on the survey a lot of people put Gerard Philippe
00:43:29,00:43:31,"or I think it's an actor or Louis Philippe,"
00:43:31,00:43:34,"who's obviously, you know, early French king."
00:43:34,00:43:36,"But yeah, they don't know that PM."
00:43:36,00:43:38,And I think probably Britain might be
00:43:38,00:43:41,"in the same position at this stage, but yeah."
00:43:41,00:43:43,- By the time this goes out next week.
00:43:43,00:43:44,(audience laughing)
00:43:44,00:43:46,- There was a survey done in America about the cloud
00:43:46,00:43:48,or cloud computing putting up in the clouds.
00:43:48,00:43:52,And 51% of the Americans answered to the survey
00:43:52,00:43:54,I said that they thought that if it was a stormy
00:43:54,00:43:57,"weather situation outside, that would affect them"
00:43:57,00:43:59,getting access to their cloud information.
00:43:59,00:44:01,It's fair enough.
00:44:01,00:44:04,- There was a tech poll a few years ago where 11% of people
00:44:04,00:44:07,believe that HTML was a sexually transmitted disease.
00:44:07,00:44:09,(audience laughing)
00:44:09,00:44:13,"- So that was a survey, a study that was looking"
00:44:13,00:44:15,into how many people understood techy sounding words.
00:44:15,00:44:17,So as well as that.
00:44:17,00:44:19,- How many people thought that JPEG was a character
00:44:19,00:44:19,in the Bible?
00:44:19,00:44:22,(audience laughing)
00:44:22,00:44:29,"- So as well as HTML is sexually transmitted disease,"
00:44:29,00:44:33,they found that 27% of the people doing it
00:44:33,00:44:35,thought Gigabyte was an insect commonly found
00:44:35,00:44:36,in South America.
00:44:36,00:44:37,(audience laughing)
00:44:37,00:44:41,18% thought Blu-ray was a marine animal.
00:44:41,00:44:45,And 23% thought MP3 was a Star Wars robot.
00:44:45,00:44:48,(audience laughing)
00:44:48,00:44:49,"- To be fair, in five years time,"
00:44:49,00:44:51,"no one's gonna know what an MP3 is,"
00:44:51,00:44:53,and almost no one knows what a Blu-ray was.
00:44:53,00:44:54,So they were just ahead of their time.
00:44:54,00:44:57,"- Oh, thanks, I'll just put all of Doctor Who on Blu-ray."
00:44:57,00:44:59,(audience laughing)
00:44:59,00:45:01,"- All right guys, we need to wrap up."
00:45:01,00:45:02,"Okay, that is it."

00:45:38,00:45:39,(audience laughing)
00:45:39,00:45:41,"- So James, you've picked a winner."
00:45:41,00:45:44,"- Yes, so this fact is from Becky,"
00:45:44,00:45:47,whose friend Chris Lemon has a birthday today.
00:45:47,00:45:48,And it is. - Happy birthday.
00:45:48,00:45:49,"- Happy birthday, Chris."
00:45:49,00:45:50,If you're here.
00:45:50,00:45:51,- Thank you.
00:45:51,00:45:54,(audience laughing)
00:45:54,00:45:57,"- Well, Becky's fact is that in 1974,"
00:45:57,00:46:00,"a research scientist, Dr. Sommelin,"
00:46:00,00:46:02,announced that he had successfully transplanted skin
00:46:02,00:46:05,from a black mouse onto a white mouse.
00:46:05,00:46:07,It was later discovered that he had actually
00:46:07,00:46:09,coloured the white mouse in with a black pen.
00:46:09,00:46:12,(audience laughing)
00:46:12,00:46:18,That's an amazing fact.
00:46:18,00:46:20,"Okay, guys, we're gonna be outside"
00:46:20,00:46:22,signing these books if you want one.

00:46:32,00:46:35,(audience clapping)
00:46:35,00:46:38,(upbeat music)
