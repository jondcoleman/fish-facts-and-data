00:00:00,00:00:01,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:01,00:00:02,Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"And which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,It's kind of the nicer thing as a fish.
00:00:05,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's kind of the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:11,"It says it right there, first paragraph."
00:00:11,00:00:12,No such thing as a fish.
00:00:12,00:00:21,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish."
00:00:21,00:00:25,A weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:25,00:00:26,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:26,00:00:29,I'm sitting here with three other elves who've got James Harkin
00:00:29,00:00:33,"and a Chisinski and on fact-checking duties, Andy Murray."
00:00:33,00:00:35,And we also have a special guest today.
00:00:35,00:00:37,It's the creator of QI.
00:00:37,00:00:40,"It's the chief gnome himself, Mr. John Lloyd."
00:00:40,00:00:42,Today's episode is a special one.
00:00:42,00:00:46,It is a tie-in for the final of the 2014 Brazilian World Cup
00:00:46,00:00:49,and we are going to be talking about nothing but football.
00:00:49,00:00:50,"Now, this is going to be quite interesting"
00:00:50,00:00:53,given that none of us know anything about football.
00:00:53,00:00:55,But we've done our research and so we once again
00:00:55,00:00:56,gathered round our microphones
00:00:56,00:01:00,and these are the best football facts that we found out from the last seven days.
00:01:00,00:01:02,"So no particular order, here we go."
00:01:02,00:01:06,"OK, fact number one, Anna."
00:01:06,00:01:10,"Yep, my fact is that the first known football chant was composed by Elgar."
00:01:10,00:01:11,The first gnome football chant.
00:01:11,00:01:13,"That was never in me, the chief gnome."
00:01:13,00:01:18,"OK, let's clarify that Elgar wasn't a gnome."
00:01:18,00:01:21,He's obviously one of our most famous composers.
00:01:21,00:01:24,"He wrote ""Land of Hope and Glory."""
00:01:24,00:01:26,"""Land of Hope and Glory"" is often used as a football chant."
00:01:26,00:01:28,"Yes, it is."
00:01:28,00:01:32,"They sing, ""We hate nothing and forest, we hate evidence too."
00:01:32,00:01:34,"We hate man-united, but Liverpool we love you."""
00:01:34,00:01:36,And they always change the teams.
00:01:36,00:01:38,But the first team always seems to be nothing and forest
00:01:38,00:01:40,because it scans properly.
00:01:40,00:01:43,"Which is a bit harsh, I'm nothing and forest like every team hates them."
00:01:43,00:01:47,"The other thing about Elgar, he's the only major composer"
00:01:47,00:01:48,to have mastered the bassoon.
00:01:48,00:01:53,"So when other composers were writing for the bassoon,"
00:01:53,00:01:54,they didn't make it up.
00:01:54,00:01:58,"No, the bassoon is a very important thing in all sorts of ways."
00:01:58,00:02:01,St. Darwin used to play the bassoon to worms on his billion table
00:02:01,00:02:04,to see if they had a sense of hearing.
00:02:04,00:02:07,Because I know that Elgar stopped playing the violin
00:02:07,00:02:08,because he decided he wasn't good enough.
00:02:08,00:02:09,"So maybe he did that thing and thinking,"
00:02:09,00:02:11,"""I'm a bit crap all the mainstream instruments."
00:02:11,00:02:14,"Let's go for the weirdo, but no one ever plays."""
00:02:14,00:02:15,"Was he a footballer, Elgar?"
00:02:15,00:02:18,"No, he wasn't, but he was a big fan of wolves."
00:02:18,00:02:21,"And he wrote a song called ""He Banged the Leather"" in 1898,"
00:02:21,00:02:23,which was actually before he became particularly famous.
00:02:23,00:02:25,He'd written a few pieces.
00:02:25,00:02:27,"And he wrote it because he went to stay with his friend,"
00:02:27,00:02:30,"Dora Penny, whose father was a rector in Wolverhampton."
00:02:30,00:02:32,"And he, the first question he asked"
00:02:32,00:02:33,"when he got off the train was,"
00:02:33,00:02:35,"""So we're going to go and see a football match."""
00:02:35,00:02:37,"And after that, they went."
00:02:37,00:02:39,And he's cycled 40 miles from his home regularly
00:02:39,00:02:41,to go and watch Wolves play.
00:02:41,00:02:44,So how did he spread the chant initially?
00:02:44,00:02:47,"I'm not, there's not much evidence of it being some of the time."
00:02:47,00:02:50,I think it was only discovered about 50 years after...
00:02:50,00:02:53,"Oh, okay, so it wasn't him being an embarrassing dad in the crowd."
00:02:53,00:02:54,"Just going, ""Come on, everyone!"""
00:02:54,00:02:57,"""I'll play it on the bassoon, you guys sing along."""
00:02:57,00:02:58,That's why bassoons are now banned.
00:02:58,00:03:00,That's like the old school of the Vazella.
00:03:00,00:03:01,Yeah.
00:03:01,00:03:02,I'm coming with their bassoons.
00:03:02,00:03:07,"The thing about chants, I really like is it must..."
00:03:07,00:03:11,That there was a very famous referee called Graham Poll.
00:03:11,00:03:11,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:11,00:03:15,"And he, on a show, sort of waxed on about how depressed he was"
00:03:15,00:03:18,about the fact that his surname rhymed with Hall.
00:03:18,00:03:21,"Because he just knew that, like, as soon as you join the football,"
00:03:21,00:03:23,you've got to look at every element of your life
00:03:23,00:03:25,"and just go, ""Where can this be turned into?"""
00:03:25,00:03:26,"Oh, no, Poll, Hall."
00:03:26,00:03:27,No!
00:03:27,00:03:29,"That's why Paul Anker never became a referee, I suppose."
00:03:29,00:03:31,"Yeah, exactly."
00:03:31,00:03:33,"But it's got an amazing history, doesn't it?"
00:03:33,00:03:37,So I managed to find who ate all the pies.
00:03:37,00:03:38,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:38,00:03:39,You know that famous chant.
00:03:39,00:03:43,"It's supposedly, it gets traced back to a footballer"
00:03:43,00:03:46,who was a goalie called William Henry Fulk.
00:03:46,00:03:47,Do you know William Henry Fulk?
00:03:47,00:03:49,"Yeah, Fatty Fulkes was here, Fatty Fulkes."
00:03:49,00:03:51,"He was a goalkeeper, this is the most extraordinary player."
00:03:51,00:03:57,He was six foot four when the average size was five foot five.
00:03:57,00:04:00,"He used to bend the crossbar, he would pull down on it"
00:04:00,00:04:03,"to make the goal smaller, to really bend in."
00:04:03,00:04:05,And he was just a furious guy.
00:04:05,00:04:08,"One time, he would disagree with a referee"
00:04:08,00:04:10,about a call that made them lose a match.
00:04:10,00:04:13,"And so he nakedly ran through the stadium,"
00:04:13,00:04:14,trying to find the referee.
00:04:14,00:04:15,But naked?
00:04:15,00:04:16,"Yeah, he was naked."
00:04:16,00:04:18,"He hit himself in a broom cupboard, this referee,"
00:04:18,00:04:21,"because he was so petrified, and he started trying to rip the doors off."
00:04:21,00:04:22,And he was fat.
00:04:22,00:04:23,Yeah.
00:04:23,00:04:24,Was that a tactical thing?
00:04:24,00:04:27,"Because I've always wondered if there should be a width restriction on goalies,"
00:04:27,00:04:31,"because if you were fat enough, you're just blocking the whole goal, right?"
00:04:31,00:04:32,I don't think that's possible.
00:04:32,00:04:34,"I don't think, although he did play cricket,"
00:04:34,00:04:38,and apparently people used to joke that there was an appeal against the light
00:04:38,00:04:40,whenever he was bowling.
00:04:40,00:04:48,"A guy called, on Twitter, called @villanesstato, he tweeted me about the football podcast,"
00:04:48,00:04:51,and he told me about this goalkeeper called Lee Roos.
00:04:51,00:04:52,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:52,00:04:54,"And his trick was quite clever, really."
00:04:54,00:04:57,"Whenever a corner would go in, he would sit on the crossbar,"
00:04:57,00:04:59,"so he was higher than everyone else,"
00:04:59,00:05:02,and then he'd launch himself from the crossbar to catch the ball.
00:05:02,00:05:03,Wow.
00:05:03,00:05:04,That's a pretty good trick.
00:05:04,00:05:05,"Yeah, that's a great trick."
00:05:05,00:05:06,If it works.
00:05:06,00:05:09,"Yeah, I don't suppose they do it anymore, so maybe it doesn't work."
00:05:09,00:05:11,"You know, Osama Bin Laden has his own chant."
00:05:11,00:05:12,Arsenal.
00:05:12,00:05:15,"Yeah, it's Osama, whoa, whoa, Osama, whoa, whoa."
00:05:15,00:05:17,He's hiding in Kabul.
00:05:17,00:05:20,He loves the Arsenal.
00:05:20,00:05:21,Is that something?
00:05:21,00:05:21,He was an Arsenal fan.
00:05:21,00:05:23,He was a huge Arsenal fan.
00:05:23,00:05:26,"And when he lived in London, he actually went to a bunch of matches,"
00:05:26,00:05:30,"bought a jersey, which he brought back for his son, which was, I believe, in right."
00:05:30,00:05:32,The man was in right.
00:05:32,00:05:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:35,00:05:41,"And he officially got banned by Arsenal from ever attending one of their matches on their grounds,"
00:05:41,00:05:42,post 9/11.
00:05:42,00:05:48,That was Arsenal's official response to the travesties of America.
00:05:48,00:05:49,I'm 2004 to 2005.
00:05:49,00:05:52,"England got its first chant, laureate."
00:05:52,00:05:53,Johnny Hurst.
00:05:53,00:05:57,"It was the board that decided who he was going to be was chaired by Andrew Motion,"
00:05:57,00:05:59,who was obviously the pert laureate at the time.
00:05:59,00:06:04,"And he was paid Â£10,000 for a year, which is twice as much as the pert laureate gets for his post,"
00:06:04,00:06:05,and to write chants.
00:06:05,00:06:09,"And you should look him up because they are appalling, like that."
00:06:09,00:06:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:10,00:06:15,"And Arsenal, actually, in 2008, I think, or I don't know, in the early 2000s,"
00:06:15,00:06:20,"Arsenal released an official chant book and distributed to its players, which, obviously,"
00:06:20,00:06:21,did not catch on at all.
00:06:21,00:06:22,"Well, like a hymn's book."
00:06:22,00:06:25,"Basically, like a hymn, like standing up in his empty."
00:06:25,00:06:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:26,00:06:29,"At the first column, though, we will be singing hymn number 369."
00:06:29,00:06:30,The referees are wanker.
00:06:30,00:06:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:32,00:06:34,"OK, Andy, have you got anything to add?"
00:06:34,00:06:35,Do you want a chance?
00:06:35,00:06:36,"Yes, I have."
00:06:36,00:06:38,We were on Charles Darwin earlier.
00:06:38,00:06:45,"And Darwin shouted at his earthworms in his last book, which was called the catchy title,"
00:06:45,00:06:49,"""The Formation of Vegetable Mold Through the Action of Worms with Observations on their Habits."""
00:06:49,00:06:51,He played the bassoon to them.
00:06:51,00:06:52,"It's got a brilliant end, that book."
00:06:52,00:06:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:55,00:06:57,So that's Darwin.
00:06:57,00:07:03,"I have found an article in the Guardian, which says that Osama bin Laden was not a fan."
00:07:03,00:07:04,What?
00:07:04,00:07:10,"A personal, but it's, I think, is open to dispute, because he was a fan of football in his younger"
00:07:10,00:07:11,days.
00:07:11,00:07:14,So I reckon that one stacks up.
00:07:14,00:07:17,"Someone wrote after he was, after he was killed, someone wrote on Twitter."
00:07:17,00:07:21,"After watching Arsenal yesterday, it was perhaps some wise for bin Laden to rush into his"
00:07:21,00:07:23,"yard shouting out, ""Come on, the Gunners."""
00:07:23,00:07:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:25,00:07:26,No.
00:07:26,00:07:32,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:07:32,00:07:35,"OK, let's move on to fact number two."
00:07:35,00:07:36,And that is my fact.
00:07:36,00:07:39,And that is that Eric Cantina was raised in a cave.
00:07:39,00:07:41,There's a good football chance about him.
00:07:41,00:07:42,Is there?
00:07:42,00:07:42,Isn't there?
00:07:42,00:07:43,Yeah.
00:07:43,00:07:45,"They did sing ""U-A-Cantina,"" didn't they?"
00:07:45,00:07:49,"And Man United still fans still sing about Cantina, or even though he hasn't played for them for--"
00:07:49,00:07:54,"Yeah, he even, in the year, that he was banned for flykicking a man in the head."
00:07:54,00:07:58,"Still one player's player of the year, perhaps accelerated it."
00:07:58,00:08:02,"When you say he was raised in a cave, Dan, do you mean a cave or a cove?"
00:08:02,00:08:03,"Oh, what's that?"
00:08:03,00:08:04,A wine cellar.
00:08:04,00:08:05,I'm sure it's a cave.
00:08:05,00:08:06,"He was French, you know."
00:08:06,00:08:07,He was French.
00:08:07,00:08:08,That's true.
00:08:08,00:08:09,"Yeah, no."
00:08:09,00:08:15,It was a lookout post that was used by occupying Nazis during World War II.
00:08:15,00:08:20,Then got a band-in and his paternal grandparents arrived from Sardinia and they occupied the cave.
00:08:20,00:08:22,And they slowly renovated it over the years.
00:08:22,00:08:26,Funny didn't take up cricket rather than football or those bats in there.
00:08:26,00:08:29,He even passed on.
00:08:29,00:08:32,"But he got the tone of the lame jokes on the podcast, right down to a tee."
00:08:32,00:08:36,"I'm in there like a rat on a fire, Panna."
00:08:36,00:08:41,"So just speaking of growing up in caves, I was thinking about people who live in bizarre homes."
00:08:41,00:08:46,"There's a story in the news this week about a house in Wales that's gone up for sale for 425 grand,"
00:08:46,00:08:50,which has its own private train station where you can hail down trains.
00:08:50,00:08:51,Isn't that cool?
00:08:51,00:08:52,You can hail a train.
00:08:52,00:08:53,Yeah.
00:08:53,00:08:56,It's not uncommon at my mum's local station in Dorset.
00:08:56,00:08:57,Really?
00:08:57,00:08:58,You stick your hand out in the train stop.
00:08:58,00:08:59,You do not try this.
00:08:59,00:09:00,You do not try this.
00:09:00,00:09:02,Where the Virgin Pendelino is going past.
00:09:02,00:09:03,Eric Cantina.
00:09:03,00:09:04,Yeah.
00:09:04,00:09:08,He sits in the pantheon of those amazing football characters that you love almost as much for their
00:09:08,00:09:14,"social life as you do for their life on the field, on the pitch."
00:09:14,00:09:15,Like Pele.
00:09:15,00:09:16,Pele is another one that I love.
00:09:16,00:09:17,What did he do?
00:09:17,00:09:21,"There's an amazing ad where he was standing in a massive pitch looking around, going,"
00:09:21,00:09:24,"you know, I've played in some of the greatest stadiums of the world."
00:09:24,00:09:29,I've played amongst the greatest roaring fans that you could ever want.
00:09:29,00:09:32,"And then he goes into the locker rooms and he says, I've shared these locker rooms with"
00:09:32,00:09:36,some of the greatest players who've ever walked onto the pitch and we spoke about everything.
00:09:36,00:09:40,"Our lives, our families, our greatest fears."
00:09:40,00:09:44,The one thing we never spoke about though was a rectal dysfunction.
00:09:44,00:09:47,And then it turned into an ad of how you need to see your doctor if you're not getting
00:09:47,00:09:48,it up.
00:09:48,00:09:49,Yeah.
00:09:49,00:09:50,It's just like Pele.
00:09:50,00:09:51,Where has this come from?
00:09:51,00:09:54,The ultimate advocate of a rectal dysfunction.
00:09:54,00:09:55,So go you.
00:09:55,00:09:57,That's as exciting as your career to me.
00:09:57,00:09:59,This is somewhat related.
00:09:59,00:10:04,"Another Brazilian footballer, Garence is very famous from the same era."
00:10:04,00:10:08,He lost his virginity to a goat according to his official biography.
00:10:08,00:10:09,No.
00:10:09,00:10:10,And really?
00:10:10,00:10:11,Yeah.
00:10:11,00:10:12,Apparently.
00:10:12,00:10:14,"He was on top James, that's the thing."
00:10:14,00:10:19,"I think the goat for the first half, he was, his nickname was the Ren because the way he"
00:10:19,00:10:21,ran because one of his legs was shorter than the other.
00:10:21,00:10:26,"And when they won the World Cup, he got a bonus and he hid the money underneath his child's"
00:10:26,00:10:27,bed.
00:10:27,00:10:28,Forgot about it.
00:10:28,00:10:31,"And then when he remembered, he found out that his child had been wetting the bed for"
00:10:31,00:10:33,three years and it was completely ruined.
00:10:33,00:10:34,Oh no.
00:10:34,00:10:41,"Talking of nicknames, do you know who Sulphus Nielsen was?"
00:10:41,00:10:42,I do not.
00:10:42,00:10:44,He was nicknamed Crobin or bandy legs.
00:10:44,00:10:49,And he was the first man to score ten goals in a national match.
00:10:49,00:10:50,Really?
00:10:50,00:10:51,Yeah.
00:10:51,00:10:55,Because his bandy legs made him very difficult to tackle because it was a huge gap between
00:10:55,00:10:57,where his legs should be.
00:10:57,00:10:59,1908 at the Olympics.
00:10:59,00:11:02,We were talking earlier about Cantana kicking football fans.
00:11:02,00:11:03,Yeah.
00:11:03,00:11:05,He's got nothing on this guy.
00:11:05,00:11:06,Javier Flores.
00:11:06,00:11:11,"He was a Colombian midfielder and he'd lost a game, lost a football match and he was driving"
00:11:11,00:11:12,home.
00:11:12,00:11:13,He was driving.
00:11:13,00:11:19,"There was a group of fans there and they started shouting ""weak, weak, weak"" and so he shot"
00:11:19,00:11:20,them.
00:11:20,00:11:21,Oh.
00:11:21,00:11:26,"And when he got brought up in front of the judge, he said that as he drove past it wasn't"
00:11:26,00:11:27,his fault.
00:11:27,00:11:28,He was drunk.
00:11:28,00:11:31,I happen to know from having been a lawyer in my early youth that drunkenness is not a defense
00:11:31,00:11:32,to murder.
00:11:32,00:11:34,"No, especially not when you're driving, I don't suppose."
00:11:34,00:11:37,"Because crime of passion can sometimes be a defense in France, can't it?"
00:11:37,00:11:38,I think.
00:11:38,00:11:41,I think France is the only country where if a murder you complete crime of passion.
00:11:41,00:11:46,"I read somewhere, I'm sure this is a powerful Andy will tell us, but it used to be a crime"
00:11:46,00:11:49,of passion to kill somebody for pinching your parking space in front.
00:11:49,00:11:56,"It's kind of such an offensive thing to do, but it would be let off."
00:11:56,00:12:03,"Football has by and large underprivileged in terms of their upbringing, would you say?"
00:12:03,00:12:06,"You would think that it's a working class spot in this country, you would think."
00:12:06,00:12:08,"And it's fine, I didn't start out that way, did it?"
00:12:08,00:12:15,"Because in the early days, there's an amazing guy called Lord Knad, who was president of"
00:12:15,00:12:19,"the FA for 33 years, extraordinary player."
00:12:19,00:12:24,"He played in nine FA Cup finals, five times on the winning side, three times for wanderers,"
00:12:24,00:12:29,"which is a mixed public school boys team, and twice for the Old Attonions."
00:12:29,00:12:35,"And he didn't just play football, he won the 350-yard race at Eaton in 1864."
00:12:35,00:12:42,"The international canoe race at the 1867 Paris Exhibition, two blues for Tennesse at Cambridge."
00:12:42,00:12:46,"And he was champion of Cambridge University in both fives and swimming, extraordinary guy."
00:12:46,00:12:50,"It's great in those days when you could be the best at everything, wasn't it?"
00:12:50,00:12:54,"You were like the best soccer player, you were automatically going to be the best long jumper"
00:12:54,00:12:57,"and the best, you know, tennis player and everything."
00:12:57,00:13:00,"But speaking of the gentleman sports teams, Corinthians was a team of gentlemen that"
00:13:00,00:13:05,"was so gentlemanly that if they got tackled in the penalty area, they would refuse the"
00:13:05,00:13:11,penalty because they thought there was no way that anyone could possibly have done it on purpose.
00:13:11,00:13:12,That's right.
00:13:12,00:13:14,I've got the actual quote for that here.
00:13:14,00:13:18,"Yeah, CB Fry wrote, ""It is a standing insult to sportsmen to have to play under a rule"
00:13:18,00:13:22,which assumes that the player intends to trip hack or push their opponents and behave
00:13:22,00:13:26,"like cads of the most unscrupulous kidney."""
00:13:26,00:13:32,"Christiana Ronaldo thinks the same thing, it's just outrageous."
00:13:32,00:13:35,"All right, Andy, have you got anything to add?"
00:13:35,00:13:36,"Yes, I have."
00:13:36,00:13:40,"We were talking about Cantana earlier, way back in distant memory."
00:13:40,00:13:45,And just a couple of extra things I found about him after he retired from the game.
00:13:45,00:13:51,"He applied to register his name and the phrase, ""Who are Cantana as commercial trademarks?"""
00:13:51,00:13:56,"Just speaking of trademarking, I remember that when David Hasselhoff got divorced, part"
00:13:56,00:14:02,"of his divorce settlement was that he claimed full and total use of the phrase, ""Don't"
00:14:02,00:14:07,"hassle the hoff,"" and that his wife was not allowed in any circumstance to use that publicly"
00:14:07,00:14:08,or otherwise.
00:14:08,00:14:09,That's great.
00:14:09,00:14:11,We were on defences against crimes earlier.
00:14:11,00:14:17,I have not found any evidence that parking spaces are justification for murder.
00:14:17,00:14:21,"I have found someone who, in France, who did kill someone else over a parking space, but"
00:14:21,00:14:22,I'm not sure it counts as a crime of passion.
00:14:22,00:14:25,"I thought it was unlikely, I agree."
00:14:25,00:14:31,But crime of passion has been recently reinstated partially as a defense in murder cases in
00:14:31,00:14:32,England.
00:14:32,00:14:39,"And last year, on Gorincha, the Brazilian footballer, so four times in his career, he scored"
00:14:39,00:14:40,from a corner.
00:14:40,00:14:41,Wow.
00:14:41,00:14:42,It must be the bandy legs coming in handy.
00:14:42,00:14:46,"And in one match against Fiorentina, he beat four defenders and the goalkeeper, and then"
00:14:46,00:14:49,he stopped short of the line to wait for the defenders to catch up with him and then beat
00:14:49,00:14:51,them again and scored.
00:14:51,00:14:59,"Nice show, coach."
00:14:59,00:15:03,"Okay, let's move on to fact number three."
00:15:03,00:15:04,"That's yours, James."
00:15:04,00:15:05,Okay.
00:15:05,00:15:12,"My fact is that in the first World Cup final in 1930, the two teams Uruguayan Argentina couldn't"
00:15:12,00:15:15,agree on the size of bowl to use.
00:15:15,00:15:20,And so they used Argentina's small bowl in the first half and Uruguay's big bowl in the
00:15:20,00:15:23,second half.
00:15:23,00:15:27,And it was such a difference that Argentina were two one up at half time when they were
00:15:27,00:15:31,"using their small bowl, and in the second half Uruguay with a big bowl went on to win four"
00:15:31,00:15:32,two.
00:15:32,00:15:35,So obviously made quite a big difference for the second half.
00:15:35,00:15:38,So there was a no official ball that was used?
00:15:38,00:15:41,"No, there was no official science to the ball at that time."
00:15:41,00:15:42,There is now.
00:15:42,00:15:47,Wasn't there a thing with cricket when it started that nobody thought to define how wide
00:15:47,00:15:48,a bat could be?
00:15:48,00:15:49,Really?
00:15:49,00:15:52,"So you could have an enormously wide bat, you know, that we could really cover the weak"
00:15:52,00:15:57,ball pit.
00:15:57,00:16:02,"There's an interesting I've found out about, there are four Olympic sports that have goals"
00:16:02,00:16:03,in them.
00:16:03,00:16:07,"Football, hockey, water, polo, and hamble, yes."
00:16:07,00:16:12,"And this interesting thing called the penalty factor, which is because obviously goals are"
00:16:12,00:16:16,"all different sizes and heights, and the balls are also different sizes, so that football"
00:16:16,00:16:21,"goal is twice as wide as a hockey goal, but the ball three times larger."
00:16:21,00:16:24,And the penalty factor is the number that takes all these factors into account to works out
00:16:24,00:16:28,"how hard it is, relatively score a goal, and then there's four sports."
00:16:28,00:16:29,"Oh, really?"
00:16:29,00:16:32,"And surprisingly, they're all extraordinarily similar."
00:16:32,00:16:33,Really?
00:16:33,00:16:36,Do you think that's just trial and error that they ended up like that?
00:16:36,00:16:38,"I don't know, yeah, it sort of feels like it, doesn't it?"
00:16:38,00:16:39,Yeah.
00:16:39,00:16:42,"It was a really interesting little factoid, which is a football goal."
00:16:42,00:16:46,"You probably knew this, James, but I was like, I knew nothing about football before this"
00:16:46,00:16:47,weekend.
00:16:47,00:16:51,"All of Cuba, as you all know, better than anybody, is that everything's interesting."
00:16:51,00:16:54,"It looks out long enough, and it has been an absolutely fascinating section."
00:16:54,00:17:00,"These little side lights, like, so a football goal is eight yards wide and eight feet high."
00:17:00,00:17:04,"So really neat little thing, but because in metric, it doesn't look like anything interesting."
00:17:04,00:17:05,"No, you're right."
00:17:05,00:17:11,"And FIFA did try, or they did talk about widening the goals a few years ago, because I think"
00:17:11,00:17:15,"it was after the American World Cup, and they were trying to get Americans interested"
00:17:15,00:17:19,and thought they were around enough goals in soccer.
00:17:19,00:17:24,"And so they thought about making the goals wider by 50 centimeters on each side, which"
00:17:24,00:17:28,"would have spoiled the eight by eight, but also a lot of the goalkeepers went, ""Well, people"
00:17:28,00:17:31,"watch it because it's so difficult to score goals."""
00:17:31,00:17:34,"I mean, if it becomes easy, if you can kick it into a bit where no goalkeeper can get to"
00:17:34,00:17:37,"it, then it just spoils the game."
00:17:37,00:17:42,"There used to be, as well, the crossbar was not there initially."
00:17:42,00:17:47,"It was just like rugby, just two poles in the air, and they decided eventually to add the"
00:17:47,00:17:52,crossbar because people just kept loving it way over the height that any human could get
00:17:52,00:17:57,and would estimate whether or not it had in fact gone between the two bars.
00:17:57,00:18:01,The net was actually invented by an Everton fan who was so annoyed because not only was
00:18:01,00:18:05,"it a trick of the eye, whether or not the ball had gone past the post on the inside or"
00:18:05,00:18:10,"outside of the goal, but fans used to line up right back by the goal line."
00:18:10,00:18:12,And so they would just hit it with their hand or with their leg.
00:18:12,00:18:16,"So when a goal went in, it just went right back out again and no one knew if it actually"
00:18:16,00:18:17,had made it through.
00:18:17,00:18:21,"There was a famous thing that happened a few years ago, I must be ten years ago now,"
00:18:21,00:18:25,"and I'm going to say it was Bristol City, but it might be wrong."
00:18:25,00:18:28,"What they had, they had the net, but they had the advertising hardings too close to the"
00:18:28,00:18:29,back of the net.
00:18:29,00:18:34,"So someone that hit a shot, it went in, instead of making the net bulge, it hit the advertising"
00:18:34,00:18:37,"hardings, came back out and they didn't give the goal because I didn't realise it had"
00:18:37,00:18:38,gone in.
00:18:38,00:18:39,No.
00:18:39,00:18:41,Is Bristol City any good as a team?
00:18:41,00:18:42,No.
00:18:42,00:18:46,"Yeah, I wondered why, because there was a famous line in Not the Nine o'clock News and Mel Smith"
00:18:46,00:18:48,as a newsreader reading out the headline.
00:18:48,00:18:51,"It says, ""Lord Lucan has been found."
00:18:51,00:18:54,"He's been playing centre-forward for Bristol City."""
00:18:54,00:18:56,I like it.
00:18:56,00:18:58,Sorry to any Bristol City fans listening.
00:18:58,00:19:02,"I'm a Trammy Robbers fan, they always beat us, but they are not a very good team, though."
00:19:02,00:19:07,"I remember I went to Bristol one time and we were driving down, we were trying to get"
00:19:07,00:19:11,"to Ashton Gate, which is the Bristol City ground."
00:19:11,00:19:15,"And we stopped and we asked the guy, ""Excuse me, can you tell us where Bristol City's football"
00:19:15,00:19:16,"ground is?"""
00:19:16,00:19:19,"And he said, ""Oh no, we don't play football round here."""
00:19:19,00:19:23,He was a captain of their team.
00:19:23,00:19:25,"Maybe it's Lord Lucan, eh?"
00:19:25,00:19:27,"Any other interesting rules, James?"
00:19:27,00:19:31,There used to be no littering allowed in the football.
00:19:31,00:19:36,"There were also, yeah, no littering near the opponent's goal, which basically then later"
00:19:36,00:19:38,became the offside rule.
00:19:38,00:19:42,I really like in the early days of football how things just went as people decided on the
00:19:42,00:19:43,spur of the moment.
00:19:43,00:19:49,So there was a match in 1894 in Sunderland versus Derby County and basically the match was
00:19:49,00:19:54,ready to start except that the referee hadn't arrived because he'd missed his connecting
00:19:54,00:19:58,train and so they decided to go for it anyway.
00:19:58,00:20:00,They brought a guy in who knew how to referee as well.
00:20:00,00:20:05,He came into the match and they played 45 minutes and there was a 3-0 lead to Sunderland
00:20:05,00:20:07,by half time.
00:20:07,00:20:09,"The referee arrived, said, ""Would you do?"
00:20:09,00:20:10,"Start the match without me?"""
00:20:10,00:20:11,"No, no, no, no."
00:20:11,00:20:12,Made it void.
00:20:12,00:20:13,Started the match again.
00:20:13,00:20:15,They ended up playing a 3-0 match.
00:20:15,00:20:16,Wow.
00:20:16,00:20:18,Do we know where the fight was going?
00:20:18,00:20:19,Yeah.
00:20:19,00:20:20,It was 5-0.
00:20:20,00:20:23,"So Sunderland still won, but really it should have been 8-0."
00:20:23,00:20:27,"When the goalkeeper who had lost the match, 8-0 was asked why they'd lost."
00:20:27,00:20:32,He didn't blame the big defeat on the fact that the referee had messed them about by not
00:20:32,00:20:36,showing up and then cancelling the points and then so he blamed it because he said it was
00:20:36,00:20:41,a failure of his to find any rice pudding in Sunderland before the match.
00:20:41,00:20:44,"And his motto famously was ""No pudding, no points."""
00:20:44,00:20:48,"He ate a bowl of rice pudding before every match, so yeah, that was his excuse."
00:20:48,00:20:54,"Football, of course, evolved from like a village spot where two villages would get a pig's"
00:20:54,00:20:57,bladder and they would try and get it from one village to the other.
00:20:57,00:21:03,There's a game in 1280 at Olgham in Northumberland where a player was killed as a result of running
00:21:03,00:21:06,against an opposing player's dagger.
00:21:06,00:21:11,It sounds rather like he's getting blamed for being stabbed.
00:21:11,00:21:12,Yeah.
00:21:12,00:21:13,It's not my fault.
00:21:13,00:21:14,He ran into my dagger.
00:21:14,00:21:15,It's not my fault.
00:21:15,00:21:16,He ran into my dagger.
00:21:16,00:21:17,He's like that line in Chicago.
00:21:17,00:21:18,He ran into my knife.
00:21:18,00:21:19,He ran into my knife ten times.
00:21:19,00:21:20,What?
00:21:20,00:21:24,"Also, it's interesting to see, again, how the game evolves and how all the rules come into"
00:21:24,00:21:25,play.
00:21:25,00:21:30,"For example, the whistle, the whistle was quite a late introduction into football and what"
00:21:30,00:21:35,they used to do was referees just used to wave a hanky any time they needed to get the attention
00:21:35,00:21:36,of the other players.
00:21:36,00:21:41,"And so it used to get passed down and I'm like, ""Oh, mate, hanky's being wave."""
00:21:41,00:21:46,"Also, a folk, apparently this guy, Faddy Fulk, who I mentioned earlier, supposedly the"
00:21:46,00:21:51,reason of ballboys being invented for the sport was a result of him because what they used
00:21:51,00:21:55,"to do was behind the goal to accentuate his size six foot four, everyone else roughly five"
00:21:55,00:22:01,"foot five, they used to place two little boys behind the goal just to make him look way larger"
00:22:01,00:22:02,and more intimidating.
00:22:02,00:22:06,"And then any time the ball went past, the boys just naturally went and grabbed the balls"
00:22:06,00:22:09,and that supposedly was how ballboys came about.
00:22:09,00:22:10,Right.
00:22:10,00:22:12,So it was a very naturally evolving sport.
00:22:12,00:22:17,"Just going back to the first World Cup with the two balls, the winning goal was scored"
00:22:17,00:22:21,"by a guy called Hector Castro, which was quite impressive."
00:22:21,00:22:24,First winning goal in the first World Cup final.
00:22:24,00:22:30,"What's even more impressive is he only had one arm and when he was 13 years old, he accidentally"
00:22:30,00:22:36,amputated his right forearm while using an electric saw and his teammates nicknamed him El
00:22:36,00:22:37,Manco.
00:22:37,00:22:41,"Andy, do you have anything to add?"
00:22:41,00:22:45,"Yes, as well as variations in the size of the ball."
00:22:45,00:22:50,There were variations in early matches between the kind of football code that you would use.
00:22:50,00:22:57,So there were the Sheffield rules and the Nottingham rules and some matches took different sets
00:22:57,00:22:59,of rules even for the first and second halves of the game.
00:22:59,00:23:02,"And in the early days as well, they turned up with different numbers of players."
00:23:02,00:23:08,So teams were between nine and 18 players basically.
00:23:08,00:23:13,"John, only you mentioned the massive cricket bat that someone used."
00:23:13,00:23:20,This is officially known as the Monster Bat incident of 1771.
00:23:20,00:23:24,So it was just one guy came up with a massive bat and come with the whole wicket.
00:23:24,00:23:25,"Yeah, basically."
00:23:25,00:23:33,"Yeah, but suddenly he produced some eight foot stumps that they nailed in behind him."
00:23:33,00:23:38,And a huge like Indiana Jones ball coming down.
00:23:38,00:23:46,So made of stone.
00:23:46,00:23:48,"OK, time for our final factor, the show."
00:23:48,00:23:51,"And that is you, Mr. John Lloyd."
00:23:51,00:24:00,"OK, my fact is that FIFA, the federation, international football association, has more members"
00:24:00,00:24:01,than the UN.
00:24:01,00:24:02,Right.
00:24:02,00:24:06,"Which I think is a surprising counter-intuitive, quite a lot more members actually."
00:24:06,00:24:11,He's got 17 more members than the UN.
00:24:11,00:24:17,"Most of these members are tiny little colonies like American Samoan, Guilla, Aruba, Bermuda,"
00:24:17,00:24:23,"British Virgin Islands, Camarines, Cook Islands, Curacao, Faroe Islands, Guam, Hong Kong is"
00:24:23,00:24:29,"a member of FIFA, Macau, Montserrat, New Caledonia, Palestine as a member of FIFA, but not"
00:24:29,00:24:30,of the UN.
00:24:30,00:24:34,"And of course, Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales."
00:24:34,00:24:40,And the upshot of this is that it is the reason ultimately why Britain doesn't have a football
00:24:40,00:24:45,"team in the Olympics, probably the only national side, as far as I know, the only country in"
00:24:45,00:24:47,the world that never enters.
00:24:47,00:24:52,"The last three Olympics of British football team was in '64, '68 and 1972, they didn't"
00:24:52,00:24:56,"even qualify, they didn't even get in, the three years before that, they're knocked out"
00:24:56,00:24:57,in the first round.
00:24:57,00:24:59,So this thing of Britain not being very good at football is actually really old.
00:24:59,00:25:03,It goes right back to 1920s.
00:25:03,00:25:10,"And in 2012, the host country doesn't have to qualify, so you just have a team by right."
00:25:10,00:25:15,"So initially, the Scots, the Northern Irish and the Welsh all refuse to take part as official"
00:25:15,00:25:16,FAs.
00:25:16,00:25:17,I don't know if that would change later.
00:25:17,00:25:18,I think it did change.
00:25:18,00:25:22,I think we did get a team in the end and fail miserably like we do in every tournament.
00:25:22,00:25:25,"And it was controversial and they're not going to do it again, I think."
00:25:25,00:25:27,So the UK isn't a part of FIFA?
00:25:27,00:25:28,Yeah.
00:25:28,00:25:29,Wow.
00:25:29,00:25:33,"The good thing about not being part of FIFA is that you're not bound by their rules,"
00:25:33,00:25:34,so there's a story.
00:25:34,00:25:39,You know how Louis Suarez has been banned from all football for biting some guy?
00:25:39,00:25:43,"Well, there's a story that he might be able to go and train in Kosovo because they're"
00:25:43,00:25:47,"not members of FIFA, which is a nice little loophole for him."
00:25:47,00:25:48,Yeah.
00:25:48,00:25:53,I like as well that there's one of the teams that isn't a part of FIFA is Palau.
00:25:53,00:25:54,Palau.
00:25:54,00:25:55,"Palau, yeah."
00:25:55,00:25:59,Whereas most of the other teams have a sort of quite legit reason like the UK for
00:25:59,00:26:00,not joining.
00:26:00,00:26:05,It's actually just this like admin era. They've been enacted since 1998 because their membership
00:26:05,00:26:11,"expired, but they've confirmed an intention to apply for membership again, so they are going"
00:26:11,00:26:12,to join eventually.
00:26:12,00:26:13,Yeah.
00:26:13,00:26:14,"Well, so they just failed to fill in the form."
00:26:14,00:26:15,Yeah.
00:26:15,00:26:17,Who was in charge of filling the form?
00:26:17,00:26:19,It was 28 pages.
00:26:19,00:26:20,Yeah.
00:26:20,00:26:21,Come on.
00:26:21,00:26:24,So the Netherlands are now through to the semi-finals in the World Cup and they...
00:26:24,00:26:25,"Well, they might be through to the finals by the time..."
00:26:25,00:26:27,They might be through to the finals.
00:26:27,00:26:32,They only booked their hotel in Brazil up to the 7th of July and FIFA have organised for
00:26:32,00:26:35,all of its sponsors and visiting dignitaries that were going to come just for the semi-finals
00:26:35,00:26:36,to move in.
00:26:36,00:26:39,So they've had to kick out the Dutch team.
00:26:39,00:26:42,"So that's today that when we're recording this podcast, they've just been kicked out, so"
00:26:42,00:26:43,I'm not sure where they're going to stay.
00:26:43,00:26:45,"Well, they could probably have the English cup."
00:26:45,00:26:46,There you go.
00:26:46,00:26:53,"I think that struck me forcibly looking at the Olympic history is that on average today,"
00:26:53,00:26:56,one football match in four anywhere in the world is a draw.
00:26:56,00:27:04,"As you look at the early scores in the 1908 Olympics, which is won by Britain 2-0 against"
00:27:04,00:27:09,"Denmark in the final, and the Danish team included pure mathematician Harold Bohr, who's"
00:27:09,00:27:14,"brother of the physicist, Niels Bohr, who, as you know, and you probably know, an accomplished"
00:27:14,00:27:19,"goalkeeper himself, and Harold Bohr scored twice in Denmark's opening game."
00:27:19,00:27:26,"And in the quarter-finals, Britain beat Sweden 12-1 and Denmark beat France B-Team 9-1 in"
00:27:26,00:27:30,"the semis, Denmark beat France 17-1."
00:27:30,00:27:35,"I think in the first World Cup, both semifinals were like 7-1 or 8-1 or something like that."
00:27:35,00:27:40,"But just going back to Niels Bohr, being a goalkeeper, he's once said that he let in an outrageously"
00:27:40,00:27:45,long shot due to being distracted by a mathematical problem.
00:27:45,00:27:52,There's another nice thing in the 1920 Olympics and twerp in the final between Belgium and
00:27:52,00:27:57,"Czechslovakia. For the only time in football history, the competition couldn't be completed because"
00:27:57,00:28:02,"the Czechs walked off the pitch, complaining of bias by the officials who are all English"
00:28:02,00:28:07,"for sending one of their players off and intimidation by Belgian soldiers in the crowd, so"
00:28:07,00:28:10,that they just walked off and that was the end of it.
00:28:10,00:28:15,"You mentioned the FA. They were responsible for banning women's football for 50 years,"
00:28:15,00:28:19,"which isn't unusual, and was banned in a lot of countries. But the women's football"
00:28:19,00:28:23,"around, just post the First World War, and up until 1921 when it was banned, was more popular"
00:28:23,00:28:28,than men's football. And women's matches were bigger crowds. The biggest ladies team was
00:28:28,00:28:34,"a ladies team from Preston called Dick Curs. But their match was played in 1920, a good"
00:28:34,00:28:41,"as in Park in Liverpool, and it drew a crowd of 53,000 people with another 10-15,000 reportedly"
00:28:41,00:28:48,turned away. And the justification for the FA banning women from playing on any FA-approved
00:28:48,00:28:53,"grounds, which was effectively the same, was that women were too frail to play football and"
00:28:53,00:28:57,they'd be too easily injured. And it was basically seem to be that it was drawing attention
00:28:57,00:28:59,and crowds away from men's football.
00:28:59,00:29:03,What was always the most popular in America for the last 20 years? Women's football has
00:29:03,00:29:06,"been much more popular than men's football, especially in schools."
00:29:06,00:29:15,"I have a ladies match from May 1881, and it was an England vs Scotland match, played in"
00:29:15,00:29:21,"Scotland. And this is the review of it from Bell's Life newspaper. So it is come at last,"
00:29:21,00:29:27,what next? The event that has had the paper so agitated was a woman's football match.
00:29:27,00:29:32,"Several years ago there was a rage for silly displays of certain kinds of athletics by women,"
00:29:32,00:29:36,but we thought the time had passed. To give the arrangement and any semblance of an international
00:29:36,00:29:43,"event, the girls had the cheek to designate the farce England vs Scotland. So not a good"
00:29:43,00:29:49,"review for the opening, international match. Not great analysis of the football played."
00:29:49,00:29:54,"Oscar Wilde said football is all very well as a game for rough girls, but is hardly suitable"
00:29:54,00:30:03,"for delicate boys. I read about the North Korean female football team, which has a fantastic"
00:30:03,00:30:08,"history. And it's another thing, I love that North Korea is a part of FIFA, where it has"
00:30:08,00:30:13,"been. Yeah, they're in the last World Cup. I think it is in that way a force for good is that"
00:30:13,00:30:19,"for a moment, as it were, violent nationalities forgotten in favour of friendly competition."
00:30:19,00:30:23,"Exactly. I mean, there was conditions apparently in North Korea whereby you could only watch"
00:30:23,00:30:27,"a match if they'd already watched it and saw that North Korea had won, which meant they"
00:30:27,00:30:31,didn't watch any matches. I don't know if I've said this before. I might have done in
00:30:31,00:30:35,"the last World Cup. They'd played, I think, Brazil in the first game, and they'd lost like"
00:30:35,00:30:41,"3-2 or 4-2, but it'd been a really good game. And everyone thought, wow, this North Korean team"
00:30:41,00:30:45,is actually quite good. They've got a good chance. And so they didn't show the first game in
00:30:45,00:30:49,"North Korea, but they showed the highlights afterwards. And they thought, well, actually,"
00:30:49,00:30:52,we're doing pretty well. So we will show the next game live. And they played Portugal and
00:30:52,00:30:58,they lost 7-1 or 7-0 or something like that. They got absolutely battered.
00:30:58,00:31:04,"They also, in 2011, in the World Cup in Germany, North Korea lost 2-0 to America. And their"
00:31:04,00:31:09,"coach said that the team played such a bad way on that match because a few days ago, five"
00:31:09,00:31:15,"of their players were struck by lightning. I was unfortunate for them. And also, the coach"
00:31:15,00:31:21,claimed that he was being coached by Kim Jong-il via an invisible mobile phone that the
00:31:21,00:31:26,dear leader had invented himself. So he was getting coaching tips from that. The team then
00:31:26,00:31:31,"eventually got busted for having steroids, for using steroids. The reason they were"
00:31:31,00:31:37,using the steroids supposedly was to help them recover from the lightning strike. But
00:31:37,00:31:41,"they also, this is really nice. In 1999, at the Women's World Cup, which was held in America,"
00:31:41,00:31:46,the North Korean players arrived. But FIFA got really concerned about one of the players'
00:31:46,00:31:50,dental care because they hadn't had proper dental care. Their teeth were looking really bad.
00:31:50,00:31:55,"So they gave her free treatment. It was paid by FIFA, free treatment. And then all the"
00:31:55,00:32:00,"other players on the team faked sort of phantom teethyl, this is. So they could all get their"
00:32:00,00:32:04,"teeth done as well. So they didn't win any matches, but they all went back to North Korea with"
00:32:04,00:32:10,"fantastic teeth. They were like, why are they smiling so much? They've lost all the games."
00:32:10,00:32:14,Does anyone have anything to throw in before we go to Andy? I do. I want to tell you this
00:32:14,00:32:19,fantastic story about the island of Grenada against Barbados and the shell Caribbean Cup
00:32:19,00:32:23,"of 1994. Do you know this story? No, no. It sounds great. It was one of the weirdest"
00:32:23,00:32:28,football matches you ever heard of. So it was the last of the group stage. Okay. So Barbados
00:32:28,00:32:32,"had to beat Grenada by two goals to go through to the next round, on goal difference. And"
00:32:32,00:32:37,"if they failed, then Grenada would go through. So at that time, the organisers had introduced"
00:32:37,00:32:43,"a new rule for golden goals. Okay. And they said, a golden goal, if it's scored, will count"
00:32:43,00:32:48,for two goals because a golden goal by definition ends the match. It's not fair on people who win
00:32:48,00:32:53,matches by golden goals. Yeah. So a golden goal counted for two. Okay. So Barbados took an
00:32:53,00:32:57,early 2-0 lead and they were doing really well. They held that all the way through the first
00:32:57,00:33:00,half. They were playing great in the second half. It looked like they were going to coast
00:33:00,00:33:05,through that 2-0 lead into the knockout stages when Grenada suddenly scored and made it
00:33:05,00:33:10,"2-1. And it was seven minutes from the end of the match. So the Barbados, the agents said,"
00:33:10,00:33:15,"right, the chance of scoring a third goal in seven minutes are very small. So they turned"
00:33:15,00:33:21,"round and shot into their own goal, making it a draw, which meant, as it was a draw, when"
00:33:21,00:33:25,"the match was over, they would have to go to extra time. Yeah. And they had a chance"
00:33:25,00:33:30,of a 2-0 lead with a new golden goal. Right. That's brilliant. Yeah. So then they've turned
00:33:30,00:33:35,"round, scoring a goal, so it's two all. And it's three minutes to go. So Grenada now has"
00:33:35,00:33:41,"to be really intelligent. And they think, right, it doesn't matter which end we score at,"
00:33:41,00:33:46,"as long as it's not a draw, it will be only a one goal difference and we'll go through."
00:33:46,00:33:49,"So they first of all, they rush up to the Barbados and they, no, wait a minute, let's go the"
00:33:49,00:33:55,"other way. Going back to their own goal. Meanwhile, the Bayesian team realise, we've got to defend"
00:33:55,00:34:02,"the Grenade and goal. So hold to here and go round. And like a penalty wall, block the Grenade"
00:34:02,00:34:07,"and goal, which they successfully do. Full time is called at two all and they go to extra"
00:34:07,00:34:13,"time and Barbados wins a golden goal in five minutes. Oh, wow. That's brilliant. That sounds"
00:34:13,00:34:17,"brilliant. Okay, Andy, any final facts that are in here?"
00:34:17,00:34:22,"Well, you got everything just about correct, though, I think I couldn't find any mistakes."
00:34:22,00:34:29,"There's a cup rather nicely called the Elf Cup, which took place in 2006 between Crimea, Greenland,"
00:34:29,00:34:34,"Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Tibet, northern Cyprus and Zanzibar. I bet no, the Cyprus one that,"
00:34:34,00:34:40,"because they're like a really good team, aren't they? They hosted it and they won it. And one"
00:34:40,00:34:44,"of the early women's football teams was called the Honeyballers, which is just rather nice."
00:34:44,00:34:49,"And the team captain was a lady called Mary Hudson, but she played under a pseudonym because"
00:34:49,00:34:53,of the band. And the FA have since apologised for the band.
00:34:53,00:34:57,"I do know that, amusingly in Germany, when they allowed women to play football, then they"
00:34:57,00:35:00,were only allowed to play and warm weather.
00:35:00,00:35:11,"Okay, that's it. That's the end of our podcast. That's all of our facts. Thanks for listening."
00:35:11,00:35:14,If you want to get in contact with any of us about the stuff that we've said on today's
