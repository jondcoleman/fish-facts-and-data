1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,200
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,360
 And which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,680
 It's kind of the nicer thing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,840
 No, seriously, it's kind of the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,560
 No such thing as a fish.

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:21,720
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,600
 A weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,760
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,760
 I'm sitting here with three other elves who've got James Harkin

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,720
 and a Chisinski and on fact-checking duties, Andy Murray.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,400
 And we also have a special guest today.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,240
 It's the creator of QI.

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,480
 It's the chief gnome himself, Mr. John Lloyd.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,160
 Today's episode is a special one.

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,640
 It is a tie-in for the final of the 2014 Brazilian World Cup

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,760
 and we are going to be talking about nothing but football.

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,920
 Now, this is going to be quite interesting

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,360
 given that none of us know anything about football.

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,560
 But we've done our research and so we once again

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,880
 gathered round our microphones

23
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,400
 and these are the best football facts that we found out from the last seven days.

24
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,240
 So no particular order, here we go.

25
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,160
 OK, fact number one, Anna.

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,200
 Yep, my fact is that the first known football chant was composed by Elgar.

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,840
 The first gnome football chant.

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,800
 That was never in me, the chief gnome.

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,920
 OK, let's clarify that Elgar wasn't a gnome.

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,840
 He's obviously one of our most famous composers.

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,120
 He wrote "Land of Hope and Glory."

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,960
 "Land of Hope and Glory" is often used as a football chant.

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,080
 Yes, it is.

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,000
 They sing, "We hate nothing and forest, we hate evidence too.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,960
 We hate man-united, but Liverpool we love you."

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,880
 And they always change the teams.

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,960
 But the first team always seems to be nothing and forest

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,360
 because it scans properly.

39
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,720
 Which is a bit harsh, I'm nothing and forest like every team hates them.

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,040
 The other thing about Elgar, he's the only major composer

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,760
 to have mastered the bassoon.

42
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,560
 So when other composers were writing for the bassoon,

43
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,880
 they didn't make it up.

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,080
 No, the bassoon is a very important thing in all sorts of ways.

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,800
 St. Darwin used to play the bassoon to worms on his billion table

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,320
 to see if they had a sense of hearing.

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,000
 Because I know that Elgar stopped playing the violin

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,440
 because he decided he wasn't good enough.

49
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,960
 So maybe he did that thing and thinking,

50
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,840
 "I'm a bit crap all the mainstream instruments.

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,200
 Let's go for the weirdo, but no one ever plays."

52
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,560
 Was he a footballer, Elgar?

53
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,120
 No, he wasn't, but he was a big fan of wolves.

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,640
 And he wrote a song called "He Banged the Leather" in 1898,

55
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,560
 which was actually before he became particularly famous.

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,280
 He'd written a few pieces.

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,160
 And he wrote it because he went to stay with his friend,

58
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,080
 Dora Penny, whose father was a rector in Wolverhampton.

59
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,440
 And he, the first question he asked

60
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,800
 when he got off the train was,

61
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,400
 "So we're going to go and see a football match."

62
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,000
 And after that, they went.

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,600
 And he's cycled 40 miles from his home regularly

64
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,520
 to go and watch Wolves play.

65
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,840
 So how did he spread the chant initially?

66
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,120
 I'm not, there's not much evidence of it being some of the time.

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,000
 I think it was only discovered about 50 years after...

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,120
 Oh, okay, so it wasn't him being an embarrassing dad in the crowd.

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,520
 Just going, "Come on, everyone!"

70
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,320
 "I'll play it on the bassoon, you guys sing along."

71
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,680
 That's why bassoons are now banned.

72
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,440
 That's like the old school of the Vazella.

73
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
 Yeah.

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,960
 I'm coming with their bassoons.

75
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,960
 The thing about chants, I really like is it must...

76
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,160
 That there was a very famous referee called Graham Poll.

77
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,920
 Oh, yeah.

78
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,960
 And he, on a show, sort of waxed on about how depressed he was

79
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,320
 about the fact that his surname rhymed with Hall.

80
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,600
 Because he just knew that, like, as soon as you join the football,

81
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,560
 you've got to look at every element of your life

82
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,240
 and just go, "Where can this be turned into?"

83
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,680
 Oh, no, Poll, Hall.

84
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,440
 No!

85
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,880
 That's why Paul Anker never became a referee, I suppose.

86
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,880
 Yeah, exactly.

87
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,760
 But it's got an amazing history, doesn't it?

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,800
 So I managed to find who ate all the pies.

89
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,640
 Oh, yeah.

90
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,760
 You know that famous chant.

91
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,200
 It's supposedly, it gets traced back to a footballer

92
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,480
 who was a goalie called William Henry Fulk.

93
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,680
 Do you know William Henry Fulk?

94
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
 Yeah, Fatty Fulkes was here, Fatty Fulkes.

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,920
 He was a goalkeeper, this is the most extraordinary player.

96
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,160
 He was six foot four when the average size was five foot five.

97
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,800
 He used to bend the crossbar, he would pull down on it

98
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,760
 to make the goal smaller, to really bend in.

99
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
 And he was just a furious guy.

100
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,360
 One time, he would disagree with a referee

101
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,160
 about a call that made them lose a match.

102
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,280
 And so he nakedly ran through the stadium,

103
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,440
 trying to find the referee.

104
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,280
 But naked?

105
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,280
 Yeah, he was naked.

106
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,840
 He hit himself in a broom cupboard, this referee,

107
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,680
 because he was so petrified, and he started trying to rip the doors off.

108
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
 And he was fat.

109
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
 Yeah.

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
 Was that a tactical thing?

111
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,120
 Because I've always wondered if there should be a width restriction on goalies,

112
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,040
 because if you were fat enough, you're just blocking the whole goal, right?

113
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,720
 I don't think that's possible.

114
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,360
 I don't think, although he did play cricket,

115
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,640
 and apparently people used to joke that there was an appeal against the light

116
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,440
 whenever he was bowling.

117
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:48,440
 A guy called, on Twitter, called @villanesstato, he tweeted me about the football podcast,

118
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,120
 and he told me about this goalkeeper called Lee Roos.

119
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
 Oh, yeah.

120
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,440
 And his trick was quite clever, really.

121
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,960
 Whenever a corner would go in, he would sit on the crossbar,

122
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,400
 so he was higher than everyone else,

123
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,440
 and then he'd launch himself from the crossbar to catch the ball.

124
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,240
 Wow.

125
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,040
 That's a pretty good trick.

126
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
 Yeah, that's a great trick.

127
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
 If it works.

128
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,280
 Yeah, I don't suppose they do it anymore, so maybe it doesn't work.

129
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,840
 You know, Osama Bin Laden has his own chant.

130
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,600
 Arsenal.

131
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,840
 Yeah, it's Osama, whoa, whoa, Osama, whoa, whoa.

132
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
 He's hiding in Kabul.

133
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,480
 He loves the Arsenal.

134
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,440
 Is that something?

135
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:21,960
 He was an Arsenal fan.

136
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,200
 He was a huge Arsenal fan.

137
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,960
 And when he lived in London, he actually went to a bunch of matches,

138
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,880
 bought a jersey, which he brought back for his son, which was, I believe, in right.

139
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,200
 The man was in right.

140
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,200
 [LAUGHTER]

141
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,800
 And he officially got banned by Arsenal from ever attending one of their matches on their grounds,

142
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,880
 post 9/11.

143
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,000
 That was Arsenal's official response to the travesties of America.

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,920
 I'm 2004 to 2005.

145
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,400
 England got its first chant, laureate.

146
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,880
 Johnny Hurst.

147
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,440
 It was the board that decided who he was going to be was chaired by Andrew Motion,

148
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,240
 who was obviously the pert laureate at the time.

149
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,720
 And he was paid £10,000 for a year, which is twice as much as the pert laureate gets for his post,

150
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,960
 and to write chants.

151
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,440
 And you should look him up because they are appalling, like that.

152
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
 [LAUGHTER]

153
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,040
 And Arsenal, actually, in 2008, I think, or I don't know, in the early 2000s,

154
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,280
 Arsenal released an official chant book and distributed to its players, which, obviously,

155
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,760
 did not catch on at all.

156
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,840
 Well, like a hymn's book.

157
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,200
 Basically, like a hymn, like standing up in his empty.

158
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
 [LAUGHTER]

159
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,560
 At the first column, though, we will be singing hymn number 369.

160
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,760
 The referees are wanker.

161
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,680
 [LAUGHTER]

162
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,680
 OK, Andy, have you got anything to add?

163
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,520
 Do you want a chance?

164
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,600
 Yes, I have.

165
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,560
 We were on Charles Darwin earlier.

166
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:45,000
 And Darwin shouted at his earthworms in his last book, which was called the catchy title,

167
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,920
 "The Formation of Vegetable Mold Through the Action of Worms with Observations on their Habits."

168
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,480
 He played the bassoon to them.

169
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,680
 It's got a brilliant end, that book.

170
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,320
 [LAUGHTER]

171
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,040
 So that's Darwin.

172
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,800
 I have found an article in the Guardian, which says that Osama bin Laden was not a fan.

173
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,720
 What?

174
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,040
 A personal, but it's, I think, is open to dispute, because he was a fan of football in his younger

175
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
 days.

176
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,680
 So I reckon that one stacks up.

177
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,880
 Someone wrote after he was, after he was killed, someone wrote on Twitter.

178
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,040
 After watching Arsenal yesterday, it was perhaps some wise for bin Laden to rush into his

179
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
 yard shouting out, "Come on, the Gunners."

180
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
 [LAUGHTER]

181
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
 No.

182
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,040
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

183
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,040
 OK, let's move on to fact number two.

184
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,160
 And that is my fact.

185
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,720
 And that is that Eric Cantina was raised in a cave.

186
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,680
 There's a good football chance about him.

187
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,200
 Is there?

188
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,800
 Isn't there?

189
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,400
 Yeah.

190
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,840
 They did sing "U-A-Cantina," didn't they?

191
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,880
 And Man United still fans still sing about Cantina, or even though he hasn't played for them for--

192
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,120
 Yeah, he even, in the year, that he was banned for flykicking a man in the head.

193
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,200
 Still one player's player of the year, perhaps accelerated it.

194
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,920
 When you say he was raised in a cave, Dan, do you mean a cave or a cove?

195
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
 Oh, what's that?

196
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
 A wine cellar.

197
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
 I'm sure it's a cave.

198
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
 He was French, you know.

199
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
 He was French.

200
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
 That's true.

201
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
 Yeah, no.

202
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,240
 It was a lookout post that was used by occupying Nazis during World War II.

203
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,560
 Then got a band-in and his paternal grandparents arrived from Sardinia and they occupied the cave.

204
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,840
 And they slowly renovated it over the years.

205
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,000
 Funny didn't take up cricket rather than football or those bats in there.

206
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 He even passed on.

207
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,600
 But he got the tone of the lame jokes on the podcast, right down to a tee.

208
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,040
 I'm in there like a rat on a fire, Panna.

209
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,240
 So just speaking of growing up in caves, I was thinking about people who live in bizarre homes.

210
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,640
 There's a story in the news this week about a house in Wales that's gone up for sale for 425 grand,

211
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,160
 which has its own private train station where you can hail down trains.

212
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
 Isn't that cool?

213
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
 You can hail a train.

214
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
 Yeah.

215
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,880
 It's not uncommon at my mum's local station in Dorset.

216
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
 Really?

217
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
 You stick your hand out in the train stop.

218
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
 You do not try this.

219
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
 You do not try this.

220
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
 Where the Virgin Pendelino is going past.

221
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
 Eric Cantina.

222
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
 Yeah.

223
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,880
 He sits in the pantheon of those amazing football characters that you love almost as much for their

224
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,040
 social life as you do for their life on the field, on the pitch.

225
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
 Like Pele.

226
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,600
 Pele is another one that I love.

227
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
 What did he do?

228
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,800
 There's an amazing ad where he was standing in a massive pitch looking around, going,

229
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,760
 you know, I've played in some of the greatest stadiums of the world.

230
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,280
 I've played amongst the greatest roaring fans that you could ever want.

231
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,600
 And then he goes into the locker rooms and he says, I've shared these locker rooms with

232
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,520
 some of the greatest players who've ever walked onto the pitch and we spoke about everything.

233
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,080
 Our lives, our families, our greatest fears.

234
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,040
 The one thing we never spoke about though was a rectal dysfunction.

235
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,440
 And then it turned into an ad of how you need to see your doctor if you're not getting

236
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
 it up.

237
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
 Yeah.

238
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
 It's just like Pele.

239
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
 Where has this come from?

240
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,600
 The ultimate advocate of a rectal dysfunction.

241
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
 So go you.

242
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,960
 That's as exciting as your career to me.

243
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,560
 This is somewhat related.

244
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,160
 Another Brazilian footballer, Garence is very famous from the same era.

245
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,280
 He lost his virginity to a goat according to his official biography.

246
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
 No.

247
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
 And really?

248
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
 Yeah.

249
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
 Apparently.

250
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,520
 He was on top James, that's the thing.

251
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,000
 I think the goat for the first half, he was, his nickname was the Ren because the way he

252
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,920
 ran because one of his legs was shorter than the other.

253
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,560
 And when they won the World Cup, he got a bonus and he hid the money underneath his child's

254
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
 bed.

255
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
 Forgot about it.

256
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,360
 And then when he remembered, he found out that his child had been wetting the bed for

257
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
 three years and it was completely ruined.

258
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
 Oh no.

259
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:41,280
 Talking of nicknames, do you know who Sulphus Nielsen was?

260
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
 I do not.

261
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,880
 He was nicknamed Crobin or bandy legs.

262
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,800
 And he was the first man to score ten goals in a national match.

263
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
 Really?

264
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
 Yeah.

265
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,520
 Because his bandy legs made him very difficult to tackle because it was a huge gap between

266
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,360
 where his legs should be.

267
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,160
 1908 at the Olympics.

268
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,880
 We were talking earlier about Cantana kicking football fans.

269
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
 Yeah.

270
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,160
 He's got nothing on this guy.

271
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
 Javier Flores.

272
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,760
 He was a Colombian midfielder and he'd lost a game, lost a football match and he was driving

273
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
 home.

274
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
 He was driving.

275
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,640
 There was a group of fans there and they started shouting "weak, weak, weak" and so he shot

276
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
 them.

277
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
 Oh.

278
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,160
 And when he got brought up in front of the judge, he said that as he drove past it wasn't

279
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
 his fault.

280
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
 He was drunk.

281
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,640
 I happen to know from having been a lawyer in my early youth that drunkenness is not a defense

282
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
 to murder.

283
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,720
 No, especially not when you're driving, I don't suppose.

284
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,920
 Because crime of passion can sometimes be a defense in France, can't it?

285
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
 I think.

286
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,120
 I think France is the only country where if a murder you complete crime of passion.

287
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,200
 I read somewhere, I'm sure this is a powerful Andy will tell us, but it used to be a crime

288
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,640
 of passion to kill somebody for pinching your parking space in front.

289
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:56,600
 It's kind of such an offensive thing to do, but it would be let off.

290
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,000
 Football has by and large underprivileged in terms of their upbringing, would you say?

291
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,600
 You would think that it's a working class spot in this country, you would think.

292
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,480
 And it's fine, I didn't start out that way, did it?

293
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,200
 Because in the early days, there's an amazing guy called Lord Knad, who was president of

294
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,800
 the FA for 33 years, extraordinary player.

295
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,840
 He played in nine FA Cup finals, five times on the winning side, three times for wanderers,

296
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,080
 which is a mixed public school boys team, and twice for the Old Attonions.

297
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:35,920
 And he didn't just play football, he won the 350-yard race at Eaton in 1864.

298
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,520
 The international canoe race at the 1867 Paris Exhibition, two blues for Tennesse at Cambridge.

299
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,560
 And he was champion of Cambridge University in both fives and swimming, extraordinary guy.

300
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,560
 It's great in those days when you could be the best at everything, wasn't it?

301
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,080
 You were like the best soccer player, you were automatically going to be the best long jumper

302
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,120
 and the best, you know, tennis player and everything.

303
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,600
 But speaking of the gentleman sports teams, Corinthians was a team of gentlemen that

304
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,560
 was so gentlemanly that if they got tackled in the penalty area, they would refuse the

305
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:11,400
 penalty because they thought there was no way that anyone could possibly have done it on purpose.

306
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
 That's right.

307
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
 I've got the actual quote for that here.

308
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,520
 Yeah, CB Fry wrote, "It is a standing insult to sportsmen to have to play under a rule

309
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,920
 which assumes that the player intends to trip hack or push their opponents and behave

310
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,240
 like cads of the most unscrupulous kidney."

311
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,640
 Christiana Ronaldo thinks the same thing, it's just outrageous.

312
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,120
 All right, Andy, have you got anything to add?

313
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,520
 Yes, I have.

314
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,640
 We were talking about Cantana earlier, way back in distant memory.

315
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,680
 And just a couple of extra things I found about him after he retired from the game.

316
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,240
 He applied to register his name and the phrase, "Who are Cantana as commercial trademarks?"

317
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,480
 Just speaking of trademarking, I remember that when David Hasselhoff got divorced, part

318
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,280
 of his divorce settlement was that he claimed full and total use of the phrase, "Don't

319
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,880
 hassle the hoff," and that his wife was not allowed in any circumstance to use that publicly

320
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
 or otherwise.

321
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
 That's great.

322
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,520
 We were on defences against crimes earlier.

323
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,120
 I have not found any evidence that parking spaces are justification for murder.

324
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,000
 I have found someone who, in France, who did kill someone else over a parking space, but

325
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,320
 I'm not sure it counts as a crime of passion.

326
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,000
 I thought it was unlikely, I agree.

327
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,320
 But crime of passion has been recently reinstated partially as a defense in murder cases in

328
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,240
 England.

329
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:39,400
 And last year, on Gorincha, the Brazilian footballer, so four times in his career, he scored

330
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
 from a corner.

331
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
 Wow.

332
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,680
 It must be the bandy legs coming in handy.

333
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,040
 And in one match against Fiorentina, he beat four defenders and the goalkeeper, and then

334
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,920
 he stopped short of the line to wait for the defenders to catch up with him and then beat

335
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,960
 them again and scored.

336
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:59,200
 Nice show, coach.

337
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,320
 Okay, let's move on to fact number three.

338
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
 That's yours, James.

339
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
 Okay.

340
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:12,640
 My fact is that in the first World Cup final in 1930, the two teams Uruguayan Argentina couldn't

341
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,800
 agree on the size of bowl to use.

342
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,360
 And so they used Argentina's small bowl in the first half and Uruguay's big bowl in the

343
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,360
 second half.

344
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,080
 And it was such a difference that Argentina were two one up at half time when they were

345
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,600
 using their small bowl, and in the second half Uruguay with a big bowl went on to win four

346
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
 two.

347
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,120
 So obviously made quite a big difference for the second half.

348
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,160
 So there was a no official ball that was used?

349
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,800
 No, there was no official science to the ball at that time.

350
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
 There is now.

351
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,200
 Wasn't there a thing with cricket when it started that nobody thought to define how wide

352
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
 a bat could be?

353
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
 Really?

354
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,900
 So you could have an enormously wide bat, you know, that we could really cover the weak

355
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,540
 ball pit.

356
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,660
 There's an interesting I've found out about, there are four Olympic sports that have goals

357
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,660
 in them.

358
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,220
 Football, hockey, water, polo, and hamble, yes.

359
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,380
 And this interesting thing called the penalty factor, which is because obviously goals are

360
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,580
 all different sizes and heights, and the balls are also different sizes, so that football

361
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,020
 goal is twice as wide as a hockey goal, but the ball three times larger.

362
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,580
 And the penalty factor is the number that takes all these factors into account to works out

363
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,140
 how hard it is, relatively score a goal, and then there's four sports.

364
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,140
 Oh, really?

365
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,100
 And surprisingly, they're all extraordinarily similar.

366
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
 Really?

367
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,060
 Do you think that's just trial and error that they ended up like that?

368
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,740
 I don't know, yeah, it sort of feels like it, doesn't it?

369
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,740
 Yeah.

370
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,900
 It was a really interesting little factoid, which is a football goal.

371
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,660
 You probably knew this, James, but I was like, I knew nothing about football before this

372
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,660
 weekend.

373
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,260
 All of Cuba, as you all know, better than anybody, is that everything's interesting.

374
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,260
 It looks out long enough, and it has been an absolutely fascinating section.

375
00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:00,340
 These little side lights, like, so a football goal is eight yards wide and eight feet high.

376
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,500
 So really neat little thing, but because in metric, it doesn't look like anything interesting.

377
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
 No, you're right.

378
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,860
 And FIFA did try, or they did talk about widening the goals a few years ago, because I think

379
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,340
 it was after the American World Cup, and they were trying to get Americans interested

380
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:19,020
 and thought they were around enough goals in soccer.

381
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,140
 And so they thought about making the goals wider by 50 centimeters on each side, which

382
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,780
 would have spoiled the eight by eight, but also a lot of the goalkeepers went, "Well, people

383
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,180
 watch it because it's so difficult to score goals."

384
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,980
 I mean, if it becomes easy, if you can kick it into a bit where no goalkeeper can get to

385
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,020
 it, then it just spoils the game.

386
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,060
 There used to be, as well, the crossbar was not there initially.

387
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:47,940
 It was just like rugby, just two poles in the air, and they decided eventually to add the

388
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,700
 crossbar because people just kept loving it way over the height that any human could get

389
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,580
 and would estimate whether or not it had in fact gone between the two bars.

390
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,780
 The net was actually invented by an Everton fan who was so annoyed because not only was

391
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,140
 it a trick of the eye, whether or not the ball had gone past the post on the inside or

392
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:10,180
 outside of the goal, but fans used to line up right back by the goal line.

393
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,820
 And so they would just hit it with their hand or with their leg.

394
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,500
 So when a goal went in, it just went right back out again and no one knew if it actually

395
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
 had made it through.

396
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,500
 There was a famous thing that happened a few years ago, I must be ten years ago now,

397
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,180
 and I'm going to say it was Bristol City, but it might be wrong.

398
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,740
 What they had, they had the net, but they had the advertising hardings too close to the

399
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,740
 back of the net.

400
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,180
 So someone that hit a shot, it went in, instead of making the net bulge, it hit the advertising

401
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,460
 hardings, came back out and they didn't give the goal because I didn't realise it had

402
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,460
 gone in.

403
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,460
 No.

404
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,220
 Is Bristol City any good as a team?

405
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,220
 No.

406
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,140
 Yeah, I wondered why, because there was a famous line in Not the Nine o'clock News and Mel Smith

407
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,700
 as a newsreader reading out the headline.

408
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,820
 It says, "Lord Lucan has been found.

409
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,820
 He's been playing centre-forward for Bristol City."

410
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,980
 I like it.

411
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,780
 Sorry to any Bristol City fans listening.

412
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,820
 I'm a Trammy Robbers fan, they always beat us, but they are not a very good team, though.

413
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,420
 I remember I went to Bristol one time and we were driving down, we were trying to get

414
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,260
 to Ashton Gate, which is the Bristol City ground.

415
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,540
 And we stopped and we asked the guy, "Excuse me, can you tell us where Bristol City's football

416
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,540
 ground is?"

417
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,020
 And he said, "Oh no, we don't play football round here."

418
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,420
 He was a captain of their team.

419
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,500
 Maybe it's Lord Lucan, eh?

420
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,780
 Any other interesting rules, James?

421
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,980
 There used to be no littering allowed in the football.

422
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,740
 There were also, yeah, no littering near the opponent's goal, which basically then later

423
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,140
 became the offside rule.

424
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,820
 I really like in the early days of football how things just went as people decided on the

425
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,820
 spur of the moment.

426
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,780
 So there was a match in 1894 in Sunderland versus Derby County and basically the match was

427
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,220
 ready to start except that the referee hadn't arrived because he'd missed his connecting

428
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,180
 train and so they decided to go for it anyway.

429
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,740
 They brought a guy in who knew how to referee as well.

430
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,540
 He came into the match and they played 45 minutes and there was a 3-0 lead to Sunderland

431
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,180
 by half time.

432
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,620
 The referee arrived, said, "Would you do?

433
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,620
 Start the match without me?"

434
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,620
 No, no, no, no.

435
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,620
 Made it void.

436
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,620
 Started the match again.

437
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,620
 They ended up playing a 3-0 match.

438
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,620
 Wow.

439
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,620
 Do we know where the fight was going?

440
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,620
 Yeah.

441
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,620
 It was 5-0.

442
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,740
 So Sunderland still won, but really it should have been 8-0.

443
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,780
 When the goalkeeper who had lost the match, 8-0 was asked why they'd lost.

444
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,180
 He didn't blame the big defeat on the fact that the referee had messed them about by not

445
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,380
 showing up and then cancelling the points and then so he blamed it because he said it was

446
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,060
 a failure of his to find any rice pudding in Sunderland before the match.

447
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,060
 And his motto famously was "No pudding, no points."

448
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,860
 He ate a bowl of rice pudding before every match, so yeah, that was his excuse.

449
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:54,020
 Football, of course, evolved from like a village spot where two villages would get a pig's

450
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,340
 bladder and they would try and get it from one village to the other.

451
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:03,780
 There's a game in 1280 at Olgham in Northumberland where a player was killed as a result of running

452
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,280
 against an opposing player's dagger.

453
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,460
 It sounds rather like he's getting blamed for being stabbed.

454
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,460
 Yeah.

455
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,460
 It's not my fault.

456
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,460
 He ran into my dagger.

457
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,460
 It's not my fault.

458
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,460
 He ran into my dagger.

459
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,460
 He's like that line in Chicago.

460
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,460
 He ran into my knife.

461
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,460
 He ran into my knife ten times.

462
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,460
 What?

463
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,580
 Also, it's interesting to see, again, how the game evolves and how all the rules come into

464
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,580
 play.

465
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:30,060
 For example, the whistle, the whistle was quite a late introduction into football and what

466
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:35,660
 they used to do was referees just used to wave a hanky any time they needed to get the attention

467
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,660
 of the other players.

468
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,020
 And so it used to get passed down and I'm like, "Oh, mate, hanky's being wave."

469
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,500
 Also, a folk, apparently this guy, Faddy Fulk, who I mentioned earlier, supposedly the

470
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,420
 reason of ballboys being invented for the sport was a result of him because what they used

471
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,940
 to do was behind the goal to accentuate his size six foot four, everyone else roughly five

472
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,420
 foot five, they used to place two little boys behind the goal just to make him look way larger

473
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,940
 and more intimidating.

474
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,500
 And then any time the ball went past, the boys just naturally went and grabbed the balls

475
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,300
 and that supposedly was how ballboys came about.

476
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
 Right.

477
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,620
 So it was a very naturally evolving sport.

478
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,900
 Just going back to the first World Cup with the two balls, the winning goal was scored

479
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,700
 by a guy called Hector Castro, which was quite impressive.

480
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,420
 First winning goal in the first World Cup final.

481
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:30,420
 What's even more impressive is he only had one arm and when he was 13 years old, he accidentally

482
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:36,380
 amputated his right forearm while using an electric saw and his teammates nicknamed him El

483
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,940
 Manco.

484
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,980
 Andy, do you have anything to add?

485
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,660
 Yes, as well as variations in the size of the ball.

486
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:50,220
 There were variations in early matches between the kind of football code that you would use.

487
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:57,060
 So there were the Sheffield rules and the Nottingham rules and some matches took different sets

488
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,580
 of rules even for the first and second halves of the game.

489
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,700
 And in the early days as well, they turned up with different numbers of players.

490
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,980
 So teams were between nine and 18 players basically.

491
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,220
 John, only you mentioned the massive cricket bat that someone used.

492
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:20,820
 This is officially known as the Monster Bat incident of 1771.

493
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,740
 So it was just one guy came up with a massive bat and come with the whole wicket.

494
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,740
 Yeah, basically.

495
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:33,900
 Yeah, but suddenly he produced some eight foot stumps that they nailed in behind him.

496
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,140
 And a huge like Indiana Jones ball coming down.

497
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:46,500
 So made of stone.

498
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,620
 OK, time for our final factor, the show.

499
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,220
 And that is you, Mr. John Lloyd.

500
00:23:51,220 --> 00:24:00,700
 OK, my fact is that FIFA, the federation, international football association, has more members

501
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,700
 than the UN.

502
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,700
 Right.

503
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,700
 Which I think is a surprising counter-intuitive, quite a lot more members actually.

504
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,260
 He's got 17 more members than the UN.

505
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:17,900
 Most of these members are tiny little colonies like American Samoan, Guilla, Aruba, Bermuda,

506
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:23,260
 British Virgin Islands, Camarines, Cook Islands, Curacao, Faroe Islands, Guam, Hong Kong is

507
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:29,180
 a member of FIFA, Macau, Montserrat, New Caledonia, Palestine as a member of FIFA, but not

508
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,660
 of the UN.

509
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,340
 And of course, Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales.

510
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:40,100
 And the upshot of this is that it is the reason ultimately why Britain doesn't have a football

511
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,700
 team in the Olympics, probably the only national side, as far as I know, the only country in

512
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,460
 the world that never enters.

513
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,540
 The last three Olympics of British football team was in '64, '68 and 1972, they didn't

514
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,020
 even qualify, they didn't even get in, the three years before that, they're knocked out

515
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,020
 in the first round.

516
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,460
 So this thing of Britain not being very good at football is actually really old.

517
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,700
 It goes right back to 1920s.

518
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:10,020
 And in 2012, the host country doesn't have to qualify, so you just have a team by right.

519
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:15,740
 So initially, the Scots, the Northern Irish and the Welsh all refuse to take part as official

520
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,740
 FAs.

521
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,900
 I don't know if that would change later.

522
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,900
 I think it did change.

523
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,660
 I think we did get a team in the end and fail miserably like we do in every tournament.

524
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,340
 And it was controversial and they're not going to do it again, I think.

525
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,620
 So the UK isn't a part of FIFA?

526
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,620
 Yeah.

527
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,620
 Wow.

528
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,540
 The good thing about not being part of FIFA is that you're not bound by their rules,

529
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,540
 so there's a story.

530
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:39,580
 You know how Louis Suarez has been banned from all football for biting some guy?

531
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,620
 Well, there's a story that he might be able to go and train in Kosovo because they're

532
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,300
 not members of FIFA, which is a nice little loophole for him.

533
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,300
 Yeah.

534
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,100
 I like as well that there's one of the teams that isn't a part of FIFA is Palau.

535
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,100
 Palau.

536
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,100
 Palau, yeah.

537
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,060
 Whereas most of the other teams have a sort of quite legit reason like the UK for

538
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,060
 not joining.

539
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:05,780
 It's actually just this like admin era. They've been enacted since 1998 because their membership

540
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:11,580
 expired, but they've confirmed an intention to apply for membership again, so they are going

541
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,580
 to join eventually.

542
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,580
 Yeah.

543
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,580
 Well, so they just failed to fill in the form.

544
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,580
 Yeah.

545
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,620
 Who was in charge of filling the form?

546
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,100
 It was 28 pages.

547
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,100
 Yeah.

548
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,100
 Come on.

549
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,220
 So the Netherlands are now through to the semi-finals in the World Cup and they...

550
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,900
 Well, they might be through to the finals by the time...

551
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,900
 They might be through to the finals.

552
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,540
 They only booked their hotel in Brazil up to the 7th of July and FIFA have organised for

553
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,820
 all of its sponsors and visiting dignitaries that were going to come just for the semi-finals

554
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
 to move in.

555
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,020
 So they've had to kick out the Dutch team.

556
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,220
 So that's today that when we're recording this podcast, they've just been kicked out, so

557
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,420
 I'm not sure where they're going to stay.

558
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,540
 Well, they could probably have the English cup.

559
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
 There you go.

560
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:53,740
 I think that struck me forcibly looking at the Olympic history is that on average today,

561
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,940
 one football match in four anywhere in the world is a draw.

562
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:04,620
 As you look at the early scores in the 1908 Olympics, which is won by Britain 2-0 against

563
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,860
 Denmark in the final, and the Danish team included pure mathematician Harold Bohr, who's

564
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:14,820
 brother of the physicist, Niels Bohr, who, as you know, and you probably know, an accomplished

565
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,100
 goalkeeper himself, and Harold Bohr scored twice in Denmark's opening game.

566
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:26,620
 And in the quarter-finals, Britain beat Sweden 12-1 and Denmark beat France B-Team 9-1 in

567
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,260
 the semis, Denmark beat France 17-1.

568
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,300
 I think in the first World Cup, both semifinals were like 7-1 or 8-1 or something like that.

569
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,540
 But just going back to Niels Bohr, being a goalkeeper, he's once said that he let in an outrageously

570
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,580
 long shot due to being distracted by a mathematical problem.

571
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:52,420
 There's another nice thing in the 1920 Olympics and twerp in the final between Belgium and

572
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:57,460
 Czechslovakia. For the only time in football history, the competition couldn't be completed because

573
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,180
 the Czechs walked off the pitch, complaining of bias by the officials who are all English

574
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:07,100
 for sending one of their players off and intimidation by Belgian soldiers in the crowd, so

575
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,420
 that they just walked off and that was the end of it.

576
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:15,740
 You mentioned the FA. They were responsible for banning women's football for 50 years,

577
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,580
 which isn't unusual, and was banned in a lot of countries. But the women's football

578
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,860
 around, just post the First World War, and up until 1921 when it was banned, was more popular

579
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,580
 than men's football. And women's matches were bigger crowds. The biggest ladies team was

580
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:34,460
 a ladies team from Preston called Dick Curs. But their match was played in 1920, a good

581
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:41,500
 as in Park in Liverpool, and it drew a crowd of 53,000 people with another 10-15,000 reportedly

582
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:48,700
 turned away. And the justification for the FA banning women from playing on any FA-approved

583
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,140
 grounds, which was effectively the same, was that women were too frail to play football and

584
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:57,620
 they'd be too easily injured. And it was basically seem to be that it was drawing attention

585
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,340
 and crowds away from men's football.

586
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,500
 What was always the most popular in America for the last 20 years? Women's football has

587
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,540
 been much more popular than men's football, especially in schools.

588
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:15,020
 I have a ladies match from May 1881, and it was an England vs Scotland match, played in

589
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:21,820
 Scotland. And this is the review of it from Bell's Life newspaper. So it is come at last,

590
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:27,860
 what next? The event that has had the paper so agitated was a woman's football match.

591
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,020
 Several years ago there was a rage for silly displays of certain kinds of athletics by women,

592
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,660
 but we thought the time had passed. To give the arrangement and any semblance of an international

593
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:43,180
 event, the girls had the cheek to designate the farce England vs Scotland. So not a good

594
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:49,460
 review for the opening, international match. Not great analysis of the football played.

595
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,820
 Oscar Wilde said football is all very well as a game for rough girls, but is hardly suitable

596
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:03,860
 for delicate boys. I read about the North Korean female football team, which has a fantastic

597
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,340
 history. And it's another thing, I love that North Korea is a part of FIFA, where it has

598
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:13,580
 been. Yeah, they're in the last World Cup. I think it is in that way a force for good is that

599
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:19,660
 for a moment, as it were, violent nationalities forgotten in favour of friendly competition.

600
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,780
 Exactly. I mean, there was conditions apparently in North Korea whereby you could only watch

601
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,980
 a match if they'd already watched it and saw that North Korea had won, which meant they

602
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,300
 didn't watch any matches. I don't know if I've said this before. I might have done in

603
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,980
 the last World Cup. They'd played, I think, Brazil in the first game, and they'd lost like

604
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:41,060
 3-2 or 4-2, but it'd been a really good game. And everyone thought, wow, this North Korean team

605
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:45,500
 is actually quite good. They've got a good chance. And so they didn't show the first game in

606
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,060
 North Korea, but they showed the highlights afterwards. And they thought, well, actually,

607
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,580
 we're doing pretty well. So we will show the next game live. And they played Portugal and

608
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:58,180
 they lost 7-1 or 7-0 or something like that. They got absolutely battered.

609
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:04,740
 They also, in 2011, in the World Cup in Germany, North Korea lost 2-0 to America. And their

610
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,700
 coach said that the team played such a bad way on that match because a few days ago, five

611
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:15,180
 of their players were struck by lightning. I was unfortunate for them. And also, the coach

612
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:21,940
 claimed that he was being coached by Kim Jong-il via an invisible mobile phone that the

613
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,340
 dear leader had invented himself. So he was getting coaching tips from that. The team then

614
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:31,060
 eventually got busted for having steroids, for using steroids. The reason they were

615
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:37,260
 using the steroids supposedly was to help them recover from the lightning strike. But

616
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,900
 they also, this is really nice. In 1999, at the Women's World Cup, which was held in America,

617
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,060
 the North Korean players arrived. But FIFA got really concerned about one of the players'

618
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:50,380
 dental care because they hadn't had proper dental care. Their teeth were looking really bad.

619
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:55,700
 So they gave her free treatment. It was paid by FIFA, free treatment. And then all the

620
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,580
 other players on the team faked sort of phantom teethyl, this is. So they could all get their

621
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,000
 teeth done as well. So they didn't win any matches, but they all went back to North Korea with

622
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,700
 fantastic teeth. They were like, why are they smiling so much? They've lost all the games.

623
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,420
 Does anyone have anything to throw in before we go to Andy? I do. I want to tell you this

624
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:19,900
 fantastic story about the island of Grenada against Barbados and the shell Caribbean Cup

625
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,500
 of 1994. Do you know this story? No, no. It sounds great. It was one of the weirdest

626
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,300
 football matches you ever heard of. So it was the last of the group stage. Okay. So Barbados

627
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,780
 had to beat Grenada by two goals to go through to the next round, on goal difference. And

628
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:37,900
 if they failed, then Grenada would go through. So at that time, the organisers had introduced

629
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:43,780
 a new rule for golden goals. Okay. And they said, a golden goal, if it's scored, will count

630
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:48,940
 for two goals because a golden goal by definition ends the match. It's not fair on people who win

631
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,460
 matches by golden goals. Yeah. So a golden goal counted for two. Okay. So Barbados took an

632
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,220
 early 2-0 lead and they were doing really well. They held that all the way through the first

633
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,540
 half. They were playing great in the second half. It looked like they were going to coast

634
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:05,620
 through that 2-0 lead into the knockout stages when Grenada suddenly scored and made it

635
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:10,780
 2-1. And it was seven minutes from the end of the match. So the Barbados, the agents said,

636
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,380
 right, the chance of scoring a third goal in seven minutes are very small. So they turned

637
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:21,860
 round and shot into their own goal, making it a draw, which meant, as it was a draw, when

638
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,140
 the match was over, they would have to go to extra time. Yeah. And they had a chance

639
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,700
 of a 2-0 lead with a new golden goal. Right. That's brilliant. Yeah. So then they've turned

640
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,300
 round, scoring a goal, so it's two all. And it's three minutes to go. So Grenada now has

641
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:41,620
 to be really intelligent. And they think, right, it doesn't matter which end we score at,

642
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,340
 as long as it's not a draw, it will be only a one goal difference and we'll go through.

643
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,580
 So they first of all, they rush up to the Barbados and they, no, wait a minute, let's go the

644
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:55,820
 other way. Going back to their own goal. Meanwhile, the Bayesian team realise, we've got to defend

645
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:02,020
 the Grenade and goal. So hold to here and go round. And like a penalty wall, block the Grenade

646
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:07,660
 and goal, which they successfully do. Full time is called at two all and they go to extra

647
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:13,020
 time and Barbados wins a golden goal in five minutes. Oh, wow. That's brilliant. That sounds

648
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:17,580
 brilliant. Okay, Andy, any final facts that are in here?

649
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:22,140
 Well, you got everything just about correct, though, I think I couldn't find any mistakes.

650
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:29,180
 There's a cup rather nicely called the Elf Cup, which took place in 2006 between Crimea, Greenland,

651
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:34,220
 Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Tibet, northern Cyprus and Zanzibar. I bet no, the Cyprus one that,

652
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:40,180
 because they're like a really good team, aren't they? They hosted it and they won it. And one

653
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:44,900
 of the early women's football teams was called the Honeyballers, which is just rather nice.

654
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:49,500
 And the team captain was a lady called Mary Hudson, but she played under a pseudonym because

655
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,620
 of the band. And the FA have since apologised for the band.

656
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:57,860
 I do know that, amusingly in Germany, when they allowed women to play football, then they

657
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,340
 were only allowed to play and warm weather.

658
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:11,460
 Okay, that's it. That's the end of our podcast. That's all of our facts. Thanks for listening.

666
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,940
 previous episodes for this series, including our International Factball series, which was

667
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,500
 a football podcast, which made no mention of football whatsoever. That's it for us this

668
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,020
 week. We're going to be back again next week and tune in again. Thanks so much. Goodbye.
