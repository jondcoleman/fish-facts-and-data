00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.200
 Yeah.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.360
 And which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.680
 It's kind of the nicer thing as a fish.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.840
 No, seriously, it's kind of the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.560
 No such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:21.720
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.600
 A weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.760
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.760
 I'm sitting here with three other elves who've got James Harkin

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.720
 and a Chisinski and on fact-checking duties, Andy Murray.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.400
 And we also have a special guest today.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.240
 It's the creator of QI.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.480
 It's the chief gnome himself, Mr. John Lloyd.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.160
 Today's episode is a special one.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.640
 It is a tie-in for the final of the 2014 Brazilian World Cup

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.760
 and we are going to be talking about nothing but football.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.920
 Now, this is going to be quite interesting

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.360
 given that none of us know anything about football.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.560
 But we've done our research and so we once again

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.880
 gathered round our microphones

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.400
 and these are the best football facts that we found out from the last seven days.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.240
 So no particular order, here we go.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.160
 OK, fact number one, Anna.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.200
 Yep, my fact is that the first known football chant was composed by Elgar.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.840
 The first gnome football chant.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.800
 That was never in me, the chief gnome.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.920
 OK, let's clarify that Elgar wasn't a gnome.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.840
 He's obviously one of our most famous composers.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.120
 He wrote "Land of Hope and Glory."

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.960
 "Land of Hope and Glory" is often used as a football chant.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.080
 Yes, it is.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.000
 They sing, "We hate nothing and forest, we hate evidence too.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.960
 We hate man-united, but Liverpool we love you."

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.880
 And they always change the teams.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.960
 But the first team always seems to be nothing and forest

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.360
 because it scans properly.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.720
 Which is a bit harsh, I'm nothing and forest like every team hates them.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.040
 The other thing about Elgar, he's the only major composer

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.760
 to have mastered the bassoon.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.560
 So when other composers were writing for the bassoon,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.880
 they didn't make it up.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.080
 No, the bassoon is a very important thing in all sorts of ways.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.800
 St. Darwin used to play the bassoon to worms on his billion table

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.320
 to see if they had a sense of hearing.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.000
 Because I know that Elgar stopped playing the violin

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.440
 because he decided he wasn't good enough.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.960
 So maybe he did that thing and thinking,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.840
 "I'm a bit crap all the mainstream instruments.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.200
 Let's go for the weirdo, but no one ever plays."

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.560
 Was he a footballer, Elgar?

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.120
 No, he wasn't, but he was a big fan of wolves.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.640
 And he wrote a song called "He Banged the Leather" in 1898,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.560
 which was actually before he became particularly famous.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.280
 He'd written a few pieces.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.160
 And he wrote it because he went to stay with his friend,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.080
 Dora Penny, whose father was a rector in Wolverhampton.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.440
 And he, the first question he asked

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.800
 when he got off the train was,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.400
 "So we're going to go and see a football match."

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.000
 And after that, they went.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.600
 And he's cycled 40 miles from his home regularly

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.520
 to go and watch Wolves play.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.840
 So how did he spread the chant initially?

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.120
 I'm not, there's not much evidence of it being some of the time.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.000
 I think it was only discovered about 50 years after...

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.120
 Oh, okay, so it wasn't him being an embarrassing dad in the crowd.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.520
 Just going, "Come on, everyone!"

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.320
 "I'll play it on the bassoon, you guys sing along."

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.680
 That's why bassoons are now banned.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.440
 That's like the old school of the Vazella.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.440
 Yeah.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.960
 I'm coming with their bassoons.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.960
 The thing about chants, I really like is it must...

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.160
 That there was a very famous referee called Graham Poll.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.960
 And he, on a show, sort of waxed on about how depressed he was

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.320
 about the fact that his surname rhymed with Hall.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.600
 Because he just knew that, like, as soon as you join the football,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.560
 you've got to look at every element of your life

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.240
 and just go, "Where can this be turned into?"

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.680
 Oh, no, Poll, Hall.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.440
 No!

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.880
 That's why Paul Anker never became a referee, I suppose.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.880
 Yeah, exactly.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.760
 But it's got an amazing history, doesn't it?

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.800
 So I managed to find who ate all the pies.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.760
 You know that famous chant.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.200
 It's supposedly, it gets traced back to a footballer

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.480
 who was a goalie called William Henry Fulk.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.680
 Do you know William Henry Fulk?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.680
 Yeah, Fatty Fulkes was here, Fatty Fulkes.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.920
 He was a goalkeeper, this is the most extraordinary player.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.160
 He was six foot four when the average size was five foot five.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.800
 He used to bend the crossbar, he would pull down on it

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.760
 to make the goal smaller, to really bend in.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.920
 And he was just a furious guy.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.360
 One time, he would disagree with a referee

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.160
 about a call that made them lose a match.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.280
 And so he nakedly ran through the stadium,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.440
 trying to find the referee.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.280
 But naked?

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.280
 Yeah, he was naked.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.840
 He hit himself in a broom cupboard, this referee,

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.680
 because he was so petrified, and he started trying to rip the doors off.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.680
 And he was fat.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680
 Yeah.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.680
 Was that a tactical thing?

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.120
 Because I've always wondered if there should be a width restriction on goalies,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.040
 because if you were fat enough, you're just blocking the whole goal, right?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.720
 I don't think that's possible.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.360
 I don't think, although he did play cricket,

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.640
 and apparently people used to joke that there was an appeal against the light

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.440
 whenever he was bowling.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:48.440
 A guy called, on Twitter, called @villanesstato, he tweeted me about the football podcast,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.120
 and he told me about this goalkeeper called Lee Roos.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.440
 And his trick was quite clever, really.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.960
 Whenever a corner would go in, he would sit on the crossbar,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.400
 so he was higher than everyone else,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.440
 and then he'd launch himself from the crossbar to catch the ball.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.240
 Wow.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.040
 That's a pretty good trick.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.040
 Yeah, that's a great trick.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.040
 If it works.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.280
 Yeah, I don't suppose they do it anymore, so maybe it doesn't work.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.840
 You know, Osama Bin Laden has his own chant.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.600
 Arsenal.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.840
 Yeah, it's Osama, whoa, whoa, Osama, whoa, whoa.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.520
 He's hiding in Kabul.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.480
 He loves the Arsenal.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.440
 Is that something?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.960
 He was an Arsenal fan.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.200
 He was a huge Arsenal fan.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.960
 And when he lived in London, he actually went to a bunch of matches,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.880
 bought a jersey, which he brought back for his son, which was, I believe, in right.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.200
 The man was in right.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.800
 And he officially got banned by Arsenal from ever attending one of their matches on their grounds,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.880
 post 9/11.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.000
 That was Arsenal's official response to the travesties of America.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.920
 I'm 2004 to 2005.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.400
 England got its first chant, laureate.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.880
 Johnny Hurst.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.440
 It was the board that decided who he was going to be was chaired by Andrew Motion,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.240
 who was obviously the pert laureate at the time.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.720
 And he was paid £10,000 for a year, which is twice as much as the pert laureate gets for his post,

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.960
 and to write chants.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.440
 And you should look him up because they are appalling, like that.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.040
 And Arsenal, actually, in 2008, I think, or I don't know, in the early 2000s,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.280
 Arsenal released an official chant book and distributed to its players, which, obviously,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.760
 did not catch on at all.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.840
 Well, like a hymn's book.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.200
 Basically, like a hymn, like standing up in his empty.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.560
 At the first column, though, we will be singing hymn number 369.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.760
 The referees are wanker.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.680
 OK, Andy, have you got anything to add?

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.520
 Do you want a chance?

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.600
 Yes, I have.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.560
 We were on Charles Darwin earlier.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.000
 And Darwin shouted at his earthworms in his last book, which was called the catchy title,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.920
 "The Formation of Vegetable Mold Through the Action of Worms with Observations on their Habits."

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.480
 He played the bassoon to them.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.680
 It's got a brilliant end, that book.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.040
 So that's Darwin.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.800
 I have found an article in the Guardian, which says that Osama bin Laden was not a fan.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.720
 What?

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.040
 A personal, but it's, I think, is open to dispute, because he was a fan of football in his younger

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.040
 days.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.680
 So I reckon that one stacks up.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.880
 Someone wrote after he was, after he was killed, someone wrote on Twitter.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.040
 After watching Arsenal yesterday, it was perhaps some wise for bin Laden to rush into his

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.040
 yard shouting out, "Come on, the Gunners."

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.040
 No.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:32.040
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.040
 OK, let's move on to fact number two.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.160
 And that is my fact.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.720
 And that is that Eric Cantina was raised in a cave.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.680
 There's a good football chance about him.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.200
 Is there?

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.800
 Isn't there?

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.400
 Yeah.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.840
 They did sing "U-A-Cantina," didn't they?

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.880
 And Man United still fans still sing about Cantina, or even though he hasn't played for them for--

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.120
 Yeah, he even, in the year, that he was banned for flykicking a man in the head.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.200
 Still one player's player of the year, perhaps accelerated it.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.920
 When you say he was raised in a cave, Dan, do you mean a cave or a cove?

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.920
 Oh, what's that?

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.920
 A wine cellar.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.920
 I'm sure it's a cave.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.920
 He was French, you know.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.920
 He was French.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.920
 That's true.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.920
 Yeah, no.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.240
 It was a lookout post that was used by occupying Nazis during World War II.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.560
 Then got a band-in and his paternal grandparents arrived from Sardinia and they occupied the cave.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.840
 And they slowly renovated it over the years.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.000
 Funny didn't take up cricket rather than football or those bats in there.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 He even passed on.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.600
 But he got the tone of the lame jokes on the podcast, right down to a tee.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.040
 I'm in there like a rat on a fire, Panna.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.240
 So just speaking of growing up in caves, I was thinking about people who live in bizarre homes.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.640
 There's a story in the news this week about a house in Wales that's gone up for sale for 425 grand,

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.160
 which has its own private train station where you can hail down trains.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.160
 Isn't that cool?

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.160
 You can hail a train.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.160
 Yeah.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.880
 It's not uncommon at my mum's local station in Dorset.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.880
 Really?

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.880
 You stick your hand out in the train stop.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.880
 You do not try this.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.880
 You do not try this.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.880
 Where the Virgin Pendelino is going past.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.880
 Eric Cantina.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.880
 Yeah.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.880
 He sits in the pantheon of those amazing football characters that you love almost as much for their

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.040
 social life as you do for their life on the field, on the pitch.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.040
 Like Pele.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.600
 Pele is another one that I love.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.600
 What did he do?

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.800
 There's an amazing ad where he was standing in a massive pitch looking around, going,

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.760
 you know, I've played in some of the greatest stadiums of the world.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.280
 I've played amongst the greatest roaring fans that you could ever want.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.600
 And then he goes into the locker rooms and he says, I've shared these locker rooms with

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.520
 some of the greatest players who've ever walked onto the pitch and we spoke about everything.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.080
 Our lives, our families, our greatest fears.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.040
 The one thing we never spoke about though was a rectal dysfunction.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.440
 And then it turned into an ad of how you need to see your doctor if you're not getting

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.440
 it up.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.440
 Yeah.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.440
 It's just like Pele.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.440
 Where has this come from?

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.600
 The ultimate advocate of a rectal dysfunction.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.600
 So go you.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.960
 That's as exciting as your career to me.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.560
 This is somewhat related.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.160
 Another Brazilian footballer, Garence is very famous from the same era.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.280
 He lost his virginity to a goat according to his official biography.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.280
 No.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.280
 And really?

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.280
 Yeah.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.280
 Apparently.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.520
 He was on top James, that's the thing.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.000
 I think the goat for the first half, he was, his nickname was the Ren because the way he

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.920
 ran because one of his legs was shorter than the other.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.560
 And when they won the World Cup, he got a bonus and he hid the money underneath his child's

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.560
 bed.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.560
 Forgot about it.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.360
 And then when he remembered, he found out that his child had been wetting the bed for

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.120
 three years and it was completely ruined.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.120
 Oh no.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:41.280
 Talking of nicknames, do you know who Sulphus Nielsen was?

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.280
 I do not.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.880
 He was nicknamed Crobin or bandy legs.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.800
 And he was the first man to score ten goals in a national match.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.800
 Really?

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.800
 Yeah.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.520
 Because his bandy legs made him very difficult to tackle because it was a huge gap between

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.360
 where his legs should be.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.160
 1908 at the Olympics.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.880
 We were talking earlier about Cantana kicking football fans.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.880
 Yeah.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.160
 He's got nothing on this guy.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.160
 Javier Flores.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.760
 He was a Colombian midfielder and he'd lost a game, lost a football match and he was driving

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.760
 home.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.760
 He was driving.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:19.640
 There was a group of fans there and they started shouting "weak, weak, weak" and so he shot

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.640
 them.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.640
 Oh.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.160
 And when he got brought up in front of the judge, he said that as he drove past it wasn't

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.160
 his fault.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.160
 He was drunk.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.640
 I happen to know from having been a lawyer in my early youth that drunkenness is not a defense

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.640
 to murder.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.720
 No, especially not when you're driving, I don't suppose.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.920
 Because crime of passion can sometimes be a defense in France, can't it?

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.920
 I think.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.120
 I think France is the only country where if a murder you complete crime of passion.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.200
 I read somewhere, I'm sure this is a powerful Andy will tell us, but it used to be a crime

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.640
 of passion to kill somebody for pinching your parking space in front.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:56.600
 It's kind of such an offensive thing to do, but it would be let off.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:03.000
 Football has by and large underprivileged in terms of their upbringing, would you say?

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.600
 You would think that it's a working class spot in this country, you would think.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.480
 And it's fine, I didn't start out that way, did it?

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:15.200
 Because in the early days, there's an amazing guy called Lord Knad, who was president of

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.800
 the FA for 33 years, extraordinary player.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.840
 He played in nine FA Cup finals, five times on the winning side, three times for wanderers,

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.080
 which is a mixed public school boys team, and twice for the Old Attonions.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:35.920
 And he didn't just play football, he won the 350-yard race at Eaton in 1864.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:42.520
 The international canoe race at the 1867 Paris Exhibition, two blues for Tennesse at Cambridge.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.560
 And he was champion of Cambridge University in both fives and swimming, extraordinary guy.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.560
 It's great in those days when you could be the best at everything, wasn't it?

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.080
 You were like the best soccer player, you were automatically going to be the best long jumper

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.120
 and the best, you know, tennis player and everything.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.600
 But speaking of the gentleman sports teams, Corinthians was a team of gentlemen that

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.560
 was so gentlemanly that if they got tackled in the penalty area, they would refuse the

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:11.400
 penalty because they thought there was no way that anyone could possibly have done it on purpose.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.400
 That's right.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.400
 I've got the actual quote for that here.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.520
 Yeah, CB Fry wrote, "It is a standing insult to sportsmen to have to play under a rule

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.920
 which assumes that the player intends to trip hack or push their opponents and behave

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.240
 like cads of the most unscrupulous kidney."

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:32.640
 Christiana Ronaldo thinks the same thing, it's just outrageous.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.120
 All right, Andy, have you got anything to add?

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.520
 Yes, I have.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.640
 We were talking about Cantana earlier, way back in distant memory.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.680
 And just a couple of extra things I found about him after he retired from the game.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.240
 He applied to register his name and the phrase, "Who are Cantana as commercial trademarks?"

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:56.480
 Just speaking of trademarking, I remember that when David Hasselhoff got divorced, part

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:02.280
 of his divorce settlement was that he claimed full and total use of the phrase, "Don't

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:07.880
 hassle the hoff," and that his wife was not allowed in any circumstance to use that publicly

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.880
 or otherwise.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.880
 That's great.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.520
 We were on defences against crimes earlier.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:17.120
 I have not found any evidence that parking spaces are justification for murder.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.000
 I have found someone who, in France, who did kill someone else over a parking space, but

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.320
 I'm not sure it counts as a crime of passion.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.000
 I thought it was unlikely, I agree.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.320
 But crime of passion has been recently reinstated partially as a defense in murder cases in

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.240
 England.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:39.400
 And last year, on Gorincha, the Brazilian footballer, so four times in his career, he scored

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.400
 from a corner.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400
 Wow.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.680
 It must be the bandy legs coming in handy.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.040
 And in one match against Fiorentina, he beat four defenders and the goalkeeper, and then

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.920
 he stopped short of the line to wait for the defenders to catch up with him and then beat

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.960
 them again and scored.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:59.200
 Nice show, coach.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.320
 Okay, let's move on to fact number three.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.320
 That's yours, James.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.320
 Okay.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:12.640
 My fact is that in the first World Cup final in 1930, the two teams Uruguayan Argentina couldn't

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.800
 agree on the size of bowl to use.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.360
 And so they used Argentina's small bowl in the first half and Uruguay's big bowl in the

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.360
 second half.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.080
 And it was such a difference that Argentina were two one up at half time when they were

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.600
 using their small bowl, and in the second half Uruguay with a big bowl went on to win four

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.600
 two.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.120
 So obviously made quite a big difference for the second half.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.160
 So there was a no official ball that was used?

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.800
 No, there was no official science to the ball at that time.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.800
 There is now.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.200
 Wasn't there a thing with cricket when it started that nobody thought to define how wide

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.200
 a bat could be?

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.200
 Really?

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.900
 So you could have an enormously wide bat, you know, that we could really cover the weak

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.540
 ball pit.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:02.660
 There's an interesting I've found out about, there are four Olympic sports that have goals

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.660
 in them.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.220
 Football, hockey, water, polo, and hamble, yes.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:12.380
 And this interesting thing called the penalty factor, which is because obviously goals are

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.580
 all different sizes and heights, and the balls are also different sizes, so that football

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.020
 goal is twice as wide as a hockey goal, but the ball three times larger.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.580
 And the penalty factor is the number that takes all these factors into account to works out

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.140
 how hard it is, relatively score a goal, and then there's four sports.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.140
 Oh, really?

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.100
 And surprisingly, they're all extraordinarily similar.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.100
 Really?

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.060
 Do you think that's just trial and error that they ended up like that?

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.740
 I don't know, yeah, it sort of feels like it, doesn't it?

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.740
 Yeah.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.900
 It was a really interesting little factoid, which is a football goal.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.660
 You probably knew this, James, but I was like, I knew nothing about football before this

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.660
 weekend.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.260
 All of Cuba, as you all know, better than anybody, is that everything's interesting.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.260
 It looks out long enough, and it has been an absolutely fascinating section.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:17:00.340
 These little side lights, like, so a football goal is eight yards wide and eight feet high.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:04.500
 So really neat little thing, but because in metric, it doesn't look like anything interesting.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.500
 No, you're right.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:11.860
 And FIFA did try, or they did talk about widening the goals a few years ago, because I think

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:15.340
 it was after the American World Cup, and they were trying to get Americans interested

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:19.020
 and thought they were around enough goals in soccer.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:24.140
 And so they thought about making the goals wider by 50 centimeters on each side, which

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.780
 would have spoiled the eight by eight, but also a lot of the goalkeepers went, "Well, people

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.180
 watch it because it's so difficult to score goals."

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.980
 I mean, if it becomes easy, if you can kick it into a bit where no goalkeeper can get to

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.020
 it, then it just spoils the game.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:42.060
 There used to be, as well, the crossbar was not there initially.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:47.940
 It was just like rugby, just two poles in the air, and they decided eventually to add the

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.700
 crossbar because people just kept loving it way over the height that any human could get

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:57.580
 and would estimate whether or not it had in fact gone between the two bars.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.780
 The net was actually invented by an Everton fan who was so annoyed because not only was

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.140
 it a trick of the eye, whether or not the ball had gone past the post on the inside or

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:10.180
 outside of the goal, but fans used to line up right back by the goal line.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.820
 And so they would just hit it with their hand or with their leg.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:16.500
 So when a goal went in, it just went right back out again and no one knew if it actually

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.500
 had made it through.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.500
 There was a famous thing that happened a few years ago, I must be ten years ago now,

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.180
 and I'm going to say it was Bristol City, but it might be wrong.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.740
 What they had, they had the net, but they had the advertising hardings too close to the

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.740
 back of the net.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:34.180
 So someone that hit a shot, it went in, instead of making the net bulge, it hit the advertising

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.460
 hardings, came back out and they didn't give the goal because I didn't realise it had

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.460
 gone in.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.460
 No.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.220
 Is Bristol City any good as a team?

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.220
 No.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.140
 Yeah, I wondered why, because there was a famous line in Not the Nine o'clock News and Mel Smith

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.700
 as a newsreader reading out the headline.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.820
 It says, "Lord Lucan has been found.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.820
 He's been playing centre-forward for Bristol City."

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.980
 I like it.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.780
 Sorry to any Bristol City fans listening.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:02.820
 I'm a Trammy Robbers fan, they always beat us, but they are not a very good team, though.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.420
 I remember I went to Bristol one time and we were driving down, we were trying to get

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:11.260
 to Ashton Gate, which is the Bristol City ground.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.540
 And we stopped and we asked the guy, "Excuse me, can you tell us where Bristol City's football

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:16.540
 ground is?"

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.020
 And he said, "Oh no, we don't play football round here."

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.420
 He was a captain of their team.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.500
 Maybe it's Lord Lucan, eh?

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.780
 Any other interesting rules, James?

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.980
 There used to be no littering allowed in the football.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.740
 There were also, yeah, no littering near the opponent's goal, which basically then later

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.140
 became the offside rule.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.820
 I really like in the early days of football how things just went as people decided on the

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.820
 spur of the moment.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:49.780
 So there was a match in 1894 in Sunderland versus Derby County and basically the match was

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:54.220
 ready to start except that the referee hadn't arrived because he'd missed his connecting

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.180
 train and so they decided to go for it anyway.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.740
 They brought a guy in who knew how to referee as well.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:05.540
 He came into the match and they played 45 minutes and there was a 3-0 lead to Sunderland

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.180
 by half time.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.620
 The referee arrived, said, "Would you do?

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.620
 Start the match without me?"

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.620
 No, no, no, no.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.620
 Made it void.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:13.620
 Started the match again.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.620
 They ended up playing a 3-0 match.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.620
 Wow.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.620
 Do we know where the fight was going?

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.620
 Yeah.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.620
 It was 5-0.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.740
 So Sunderland still won, but really it should have been 8-0.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.780
 When the goalkeeper who had lost the match, 8-0 was asked why they'd lost.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.180
 He didn't blame the big defeat on the fact that the referee had messed them about by not

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:36.380
 showing up and then cancelling the points and then so he blamed it because he said it was

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:41.060
 a failure of his to find any rice pudding in Sunderland before the match.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.060
 And his motto famously was "No pudding, no points."

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:48.860
 He ate a bowl of rice pudding before every match, so yeah, that was his excuse.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:54.020
 Football, of course, evolved from like a village spot where two villages would get a pig's

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.340
 bladder and they would try and get it from one village to the other.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:03.780
 There's a game in 1280 at Olgham in Northumberland where a player was killed as a result of running

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.280
 against an opposing player's dagger.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:11.460
 It sounds rather like he's getting blamed for being stabbed.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.460
 Yeah.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.460
 It's not my fault.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.460
 He ran into my dagger.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.460
 It's not my fault.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.460
 He ran into my dagger.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.460
 He's like that line in Chicago.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.460
 He ran into my knife.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.460
 He ran into my knife ten times.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.460
 What?

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.580
 Also, it's interesting to see, again, how the game evolves and how all the rules come into

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.580
 play.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:30.060
 For example, the whistle, the whistle was quite a late introduction into football and what

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:35.660
 they used to do was referees just used to wave a hanky any time they needed to get the attention

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.660
 of the other players.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:41.020
 And so it used to get passed down and I'm like, "Oh, mate, hanky's being wave."

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:46.500
 Also, a folk, apparently this guy, Faddy Fulk, who I mentioned earlier, supposedly the

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:51.420
 reason of ballboys being invented for the sport was a result of him because what they used

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.940
 to do was behind the goal to accentuate his size six foot four, everyone else roughly five

00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:01.420
 foot five, they used to place two little boys behind the goal just to make him look way larger

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.940
 and more intimidating.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.500
 And then any time the ball went past, the boys just naturally went and grabbed the balls

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.300
 and that supposedly was how ballboys came about.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.300
 Right.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.620
 So it was a very naturally evolving sport.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:17.900
 Just going back to the first World Cup with the two balls, the winning goal was scored

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.700
 by a guy called Hector Castro, which was quite impressive.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.420
 First winning goal in the first World Cup final.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:30.420
 What's even more impressive is he only had one arm and when he was 13 years old, he accidentally

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:36.380
 amputated his right forearm while using an electric saw and his teammates nicknamed him El

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.940
 Manco.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.980
 Andy, do you have anything to add?

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.660
 Yes, as well as variations in the size of the ball.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:50.220
 There were variations in early matches between the kind of football code that you would use.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:57.060
 So there were the Sheffield rules and the Nottingham rules and some matches took different sets

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.580
 of rules even for the first and second halves of the game.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.700
 And in the early days as well, they turned up with different numbers of players.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:08.980
 So teams were between nine and 18 players basically.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:13.220
 John, only you mentioned the massive cricket bat that someone used.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:20.820
 This is officially known as the Monster Bat incident of 1771.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.740
 So it was just one guy came up with a massive bat and come with the whole wicket.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:25.740
 Yeah, basically.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:33.900
 Yeah, but suddenly he produced some eight foot stumps that they nailed in behind him.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.140
 And a huge like Indiana Jones ball coming down.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:46.500
 So made of stone.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.620
 OK, time for our final factor, the show.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.220
 And that is you, Mr. John Lloyd.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:24:00.700
 OK, my fact is that FIFA, the federation, international football association, has more members

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.700
 than the UN.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.700
 Right.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.700
 Which I think is a surprising counter-intuitive, quite a lot more members actually.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:11.260
 He's got 17 more members than the UN.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:17.900
 Most of these members are tiny little colonies like American Samoan, Guilla, Aruba, Bermuda,

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:23.260
 British Virgin Islands, Camarines, Cook Islands, Curacao, Faroe Islands, Guam, Hong Kong is

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:29.180
 a member of FIFA, Macau, Montserrat, New Caledonia, Palestine as a member of FIFA, but not

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.660
 of the UN.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:34.340
 And of course, Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:40.100
 And the upshot of this is that it is the reason ultimately why Britain doesn't have a football

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:45.700
 team in the Olympics, probably the only national side, as far as I know, the only country in

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.460
 the world that never enters.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:52.540
 The last three Olympics of British football team was in '64, '68 and 1972, they didn't

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.020
 even qualify, they didn't even get in, the three years before that, they're knocked out

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.020
 in the first round.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.460
 So this thing of Britain not being very good at football is actually really old.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.700
 It goes right back to 1920s.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:10.020
 And in 2012, the host country doesn't have to qualify, so you just have a team by right.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:15.740
 So initially, the Scots, the Northern Irish and the Welsh all refuse to take part as official

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.740
 FAs.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:17.900
 I don't know if that would change later.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:18.900
 I think it did change.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:22.660
 I think we did get a team in the end and fail miserably like we do in every tournament.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.340
 And it was controversial and they're not going to do it again, I think.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.620
 So the UK isn't a part of FIFA?

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.620
 Yeah.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.620
 Wow.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:33.540
 The good thing about not being part of FIFA is that you're not bound by their rules,

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.540
 so there's a story.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:39.580
 You know how Louis Suarez has been banned from all football for biting some guy?

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.620
 Well, there's a story that he might be able to go and train in Kosovo because they're

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:47.300
 not members of FIFA, which is a nice little loophole for him.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.300
 Yeah.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:53.100
 I like as well that there's one of the teams that isn't a part of FIFA is Palau.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.100
 Palau.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.100
 Palau, yeah.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.060
 Whereas most of the other teams have a sort of quite legit reason like the UK for

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.060
 not joining.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:05.780
 It's actually just this like admin era. They've been enacted since 1998 because their membership

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:11.580
 expired, but they've confirmed an intention to apply for membership again, so they are going

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.580
 to join eventually.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.580
 Yeah.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.580
 Well, so they just failed to fill in the form.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.580
 Yeah.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.620
 Who was in charge of filling the form?

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.100
 It was 28 pages.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.100
 Yeah.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.100
 Come on.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.220
 So the Netherlands are now through to the semi-finals in the World Cup and they...

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.900
 Well, they might be through to the finals by the time...

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.900
 They might be through to the finals.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:32.540
 They only booked their hotel in Brazil up to the 7th of July and FIFA have organised for

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.820
 all of its sponsors and visiting dignitaries that were going to come just for the semi-finals

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.820
 to move in.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.020
 So they've had to kick out the Dutch team.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.220
 So that's today that when we're recording this podcast, they've just been kicked out, so

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.420
 I'm not sure where they're going to stay.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.540
 Well, they could probably have the English cup.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.540
 There you go.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:53.740
 I think that struck me forcibly looking at the Olympic history is that on average today,

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.940
 one football match in four anywhere in the world is a draw.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:04.620
 As you look at the early scores in the 1908 Olympics, which is won by Britain 2-0 against

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.860
 Denmark in the final, and the Danish team included pure mathematician Harold Bohr, who's

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:14.820
 brother of the physicist, Niels Bohr, who, as you know, and you probably know, an accomplished

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.100
 goalkeeper himself, and Harold Bohr scored twice in Denmark's opening game.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:26.620
 And in the quarter-finals, Britain beat Sweden 12-1 and Denmark beat France B-Team 9-1 in

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.260
 the semis, Denmark beat France 17-1.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:35.300
 I think in the first World Cup, both semifinals were like 7-1 or 8-1 or something like that.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:40.540
 But just going back to Niels Bohr, being a goalkeeper, he's once said that he let in an outrageously

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:45.580
 long shot due to being distracted by a mathematical problem.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:52.420
 There's another nice thing in the 1920 Olympics and twerp in the final between Belgium and

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:57.460
 Czechslovakia. For the only time in football history, the competition couldn't be completed because

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:02.180
 the Czechs walked off the pitch, complaining of bias by the officials who are all English

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:07.100
 for sending one of their players off and intimidation by Belgian soldiers in the crowd, so

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.420
 that they just walked off and that was the end of it.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:15.740
 You mentioned the FA. They were responsible for banning women's football for 50 years,

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:19.580
 which isn't unusual, and was banned in a lot of countries. But the women's football

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:23.860
 around, just post the First World War, and up until 1921 when it was banned, was more popular

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:28.580
 than men's football. And women's matches were bigger crowds. The biggest ladies team was

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:34.460
 a ladies team from Preston called Dick Curs. But their match was played in 1920, a good

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:41.500
 as in Park in Liverpool, and it drew a crowd of 53,000 people with another 10-15,000 reportedly

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:48.700
 turned away. And the justification for the FA banning women from playing on any FA-approved

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:53.140
 grounds, which was effectively the same, was that women were too frail to play football and

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:57.620
 they'd be too easily injured. And it was basically seem to be that it was drawing attention

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.340
 and crowds away from men's football.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:03.500
 What was always the most popular in America for the last 20 years? Women's football has

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.540
 been much more popular than men's football, especially in schools.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:15.020
 I have a ladies match from May 1881, and it was an England vs Scotland match, played in

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:21.820
 Scotland. And this is the review of it from Bell's Life newspaper. So it is come at last,

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:27.860
 what next? The event that has had the paper so agitated was a woman's football match.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:32.020
 Several years ago there was a rage for silly displays of certain kinds of athletics by women,

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:36.660
 but we thought the time had passed. To give the arrangement and any semblance of an international

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:43.180
 event, the girls had the cheek to designate the farce England vs Scotland. So not a good

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:49.460
 review for the opening, international match. Not great analysis of the football played.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:54.820
 Oscar Wilde said football is all very well as a game for rough girls, but is hardly suitable

00:29:54.820 --> 00:30:03.860
 for delicate boys. I read about the North Korean female football team, which has a fantastic

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:08.340
 history. And it's another thing, I love that North Korea is a part of FIFA, where it has

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:13.580
 been. Yeah, they're in the last World Cup. I think it is in that way a force for good is that

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:19.660
 for a moment, as it were, violent nationalities forgotten in favour of friendly competition.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.780
 Exactly. I mean, there was conditions apparently in North Korea whereby you could only watch

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:27.980
 a match if they'd already watched it and saw that North Korea had won, which meant they

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:31.300
 didn't watch any matches. I don't know if I've said this before. I might have done in

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.980
 the last World Cup. They'd played, I think, Brazil in the first game, and they'd lost like

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:41.060
 3-2 or 4-2, but it'd been a really good game. And everyone thought, wow, this North Korean team

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.500
 is actually quite good. They've got a good chance. And so they didn't show the first game in

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.060
 North Korea, but they showed the highlights afterwards. And they thought, well, actually,

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.580
 we're doing pretty well. So we will show the next game live. And they played Portugal and

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:58.180
 they lost 7-1 or 7-0 or something like that. They got absolutely battered.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:04.740
 They also, in 2011, in the World Cup in Germany, North Korea lost 2-0 to America. And their

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:09.700
 coach said that the team played such a bad way on that match because a few days ago, five

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:15.180
 of their players were struck by lightning. I was unfortunate for them. And also, the coach

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:21.940
 claimed that he was being coached by Kim Jong-il via an invisible mobile phone that the

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:26.340
 dear leader had invented himself. So he was getting coaching tips from that. The team then

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:31.060
 eventually got busted for having steroids, for using steroids. The reason they were

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:37.260
 using the steroids supposedly was to help them recover from the lightning strike. But

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:41.900
 they also, this is really nice. In 1999, at the Women's World Cup, which was held in America,

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:46.060
 the North Korean players arrived. But FIFA got really concerned about one of the players'

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:50.380
 dental care because they hadn't had proper dental care. Their teeth were looking really bad.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:55.700
 So they gave her free treatment. It was paid by FIFA, free treatment. And then all the

00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:00.580
 other players on the team faked sort of phantom teethyl, this is. So they could all get their

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:04.000
 teeth done as well. So they didn't win any matches, but they all went back to North Korea with

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.700
 fantastic teeth. They were like, why are they smiling so much? They've lost all the games.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.420
 Does anyone have anything to throw in before we go to Andy? I do. I want to tell you this

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:19.900
 fantastic story about the island of Grenada against Barbados and the shell Caribbean Cup

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.500
 of 1994. Do you know this story? No, no. It sounds great. It was one of the weirdest

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.300
 football matches you ever heard of. So it was the last of the group stage. Okay. So Barbados

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:32.780
 had to beat Grenada by two goals to go through to the next round, on goal difference. And

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:37.900
 if they failed, then Grenada would go through. So at that time, the organisers had introduced

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:43.780
 a new rule for golden goals. Okay. And they said, a golden goal, if it's scored, will count

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:48.940
 for two goals because a golden goal by definition ends the match. It's not fair on people who win

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:53.460
 matches by golden goals. Yeah. So a golden goal counted for two. Okay. So Barbados took an

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.220
 early 2-0 lead and they were doing really well. They held that all the way through the first

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.540
 half. They were playing great in the second half. It looked like they were going to coast

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:05.620
 through that 2-0 lead into the knockout stages when Grenada suddenly scored and made it

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:10.780
 2-1. And it was seven minutes from the end of the match. So the Barbados, the agents said,

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:15.380
 right, the chance of scoring a third goal in seven minutes are very small. So they turned

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:21.860
 round and shot into their own goal, making it a draw, which meant, as it was a draw, when

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:25.140
 the match was over, they would have to go to extra time. Yeah. And they had a chance

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:30.700
 of a 2-0 lead with a new golden goal. Right. That's brilliant. Yeah. So then they've turned

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:35.300
 round, scoring a goal, so it's two all. And it's three minutes to go. So Grenada now has

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:41.620
 to be really intelligent. And they think, right, it doesn't matter which end we score at,

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:46.340
 as long as it's not a draw, it will be only a one goal difference and we'll go through.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.580
 So they first of all, they rush up to the Barbados and they, no, wait a minute, let's go the

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:55.820
 other way. Going back to their own goal. Meanwhile, the Bayesian team realise, we've got to defend

00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:02.020
 the Grenade and goal. So hold to here and go round. And like a penalty wall, block the Grenade

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:07.660
 and goal, which they successfully do. Full time is called at two all and they go to extra

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:13.020
 time and Barbados wins a golden goal in five minutes. Oh, wow. That's brilliant. That sounds

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:17.580
 brilliant. Okay, Andy, any final facts that are in here?

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:22.140
 Well, you got everything just about correct, though, I think I couldn't find any mistakes.

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:29.180
 There's a cup rather nicely called the Elf Cup, which took place in 2006 between Crimea, Greenland,

00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:34.220
 Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Tibet, northern Cyprus and Zanzibar. I bet no, the Cyprus one that,

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:40.180
 because they're like a really good team, aren't they? They hosted it and they won it. And one

00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:44.900
 of the early women's football teams was called the Honeyballers, which is just rather nice.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:49.500
 And the team captain was a lady called Mary Hudson, but she played under a pseudonym because

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:53.620
 of the band. And the FA have since apologised for the band.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:57.860
 I do know that, amusingly in Germany, when they allowed women to play football, then they

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.340
 were only allowed to play and warm weather.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:11.460
 Okay, that's it. That's the end of our podcast. That's all of our facts. Thanks for listening.
