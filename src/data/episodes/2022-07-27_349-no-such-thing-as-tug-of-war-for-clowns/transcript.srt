1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,020
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,260
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,660
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,900
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,260
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,480
 and James Harkin.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,960
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,840
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,760
 and in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,440
 Starting with you, Andy.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,140
 - My fact is that museums need visitors' breath

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,440
 in order to preserve their exhibits properly.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,280
 - Interesting.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,880
 - Museums rely on the moisture from our bodies

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,660
 to keep their things nice.

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,720
 'Cause when you breathe out,

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,840
 it's more moist than when you breathe in.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,680
 You breathe in normal air and it takes a bit

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,320
 of your internal juice and it transports it to the outside.

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,680
 - Don't say internal juice, that's horrible.

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,840
 It's, sorry, Andy, can I just ask with, at the moment

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,480
 with COVID happening, not many people going to museums,

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,000
 is there a way that we can donate our internal juice?

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,840
 - Yeah, the British Museum is taking donations.

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,600
 You just say free post British Museum

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,640
 and you slap that on a big bag of juice.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,920
 And they'll release it among the, yeah.

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,720
 So this is according to a curator at the British Museum,

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,120
 which has been closed for the longest time in its history.

31
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,880
 And normally they would get about 17,000 visitors a day

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,880
 and all those people and their breath

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,520
 help keep the right level of humidity in the air.

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,720
 'Cause they've got so many objects

35
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,400
 which require certain levels of humidity,

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,280
 things that can dry out easily.

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,120
 Maybe the object's made of bone,

38
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,560
 which might crack if it gets too low.

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,280
 And this is a problem.

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,760
 Objects have been at risk of cracking out.

41
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,800
 - So when we all are able to return to museums,

42
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,000
 you're suggesting maybe we should go around

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,760
 spitting on the exhibits?

44
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,160
 - Yes, I am, absolutely.

45
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,400
 - We all have a lot of friends who work in museums.

46
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,000
 So I thought I'd contact a few of those

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,880
 to see if they have the same problems in other museums.

48
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,480
 So one of our friends is Paolo Viscardi

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,360
 at the National Museum of Ireland.

50
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,480
 And he said that this is spot on.

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,400
 Their problem is less with people breathing out so much,

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,080
 but more that when you open the door normally,

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,120
 it would bring in a lot of moisture from outside

54
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,400
 because it's always pissing it down and doubling.

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,800
 And so basically you would open the door

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,320
 and that would bring in moisture from outside

57
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,880
 and no one's opening the door at the moment.

58
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,360
 So that's a problem.

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,240
 I also spoke to our friends at the Penis Museum in Iceland

60
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,720
 to see if they have any problems with humidity

61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,440
 at the moment and Thorda wrote back to me and said,

62
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,080
 they've not had problems with conservation

63
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,480
 due to lack of humidity.

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,480
 We have discontinued stuffing our penises

65
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,640
 because it led to considerable shrinkage

66
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,120
 which may prove problematic when you're in the penis business.

67
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,080
 But the few taxidermy specimens we have

68
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,960
 have actually fared a little bit better due to COVID,

69
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,480
 mainly due to the lack of people touching them.

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,320
 - Right.

71
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,000
 - So people aren't touching his penises as much

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,320
 and so things are a bit better for him under COVID.

73
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
 - Blessing.

74
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,400
 - And just a reminder for anyone who visits the museum,

75
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
 don't spit on them when it's open again.

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,560
 People are penises alone.

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,040
 Can I just interject here to say how angry I was

78
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,160
 that you chose the one week I was away

79
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,840
 to discuss the Icelandic Penis Museum?

80
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,680
 - Oh, sorry.

81
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,520
 - I just want to mention that that was quite thoughtless.

82
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,160
 I discovered this week when I was listening back,

83
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,960
 you let Sandy Talks speak about it instead of me.

84
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,280
 - I'm really sorry about that.

85
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,760
 When lockdown's over, just come, you can come round

86
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,080
 and we'll get a bottle of wine out.

87
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,800
 We can talk about the Icelandic Penis Museum.

88
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,760
 - Honestly, Anna. - James, that means so much to me.

89
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,160
 - Anna, we didn't know you listened to the podcast.

90
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,200
 - We thought you did, we of course.

91
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,120
 - I tried to avoid it.

92
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
 Someone else had it on in the background.

93
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,480
 But I don't think you did mention

94
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,400
 they've got their only human penis quite recently.

95
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
 - Don't turn this into a penis museum, Jack.

96
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,840
 - I'm getting it back to the penis museum.

97
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,400
 I will make up for that lost time.

98
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,600
 No, I did enjoy a quote from the penis museum

99
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,720
 when I was looking at how they preserved their objects

100
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,400
 and they got their first human penis in 2011

101
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,600
 from the 95-year-old, Pally Arison,

102
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,120
 who promised it, I think, 15 years ago.

103
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,880
 I don't think you mentioned this.

104
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,080
 So he promised it 15 years ago to his friend as the curator,

105
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,280
 lived for an extra 15 years, which possibly wasn't expected.

106
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,320
 And there was an interview with the curator

107
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,800
 who was looking down at this 95-year-old man's penis,

108
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,440
 which he now has preserved.

109
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,160
 And the independent reporting on it said,

110
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,960
 "Glancing down at the glass container,

111
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,280
 "holding a grayish-brown shriveled mass,

112
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,600
 "he admitted that the preservation had not been successful."

113
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,200
 (laughing)

114
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,520
 - Oh, dear.

115
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,200
 - I remember that story because I think there was a race

116
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,880
 to get the first human penis into the penis museum.

117
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,880
 And it was between this 95-year-old guy

118
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,840
 and some 27-year-old bloke,

119
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,600
 and whichever of them died first

120
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,040
 was going to donate their penis.

121
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,640
 - That is a brilliant plot for a murdered novel, isn't it?

122
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,920
 (laughing)

123
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,960
 - Right, anyway, anyway.

124
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,520
 - Sorry, I've got that out of my system now.

125
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,480
 You can go back to proper use.

126
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,080
 Anyway, we'll edit that into the previous episode.

127
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,680
 (laughing)

128
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,840
 - I'd appreciate that.

129
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,160
 - But it's a big, it's a huge problem,

130
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,480
 and it's not the only problem they have.

131
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,040
 So in June, you remember it was a very hot summer this year,

132
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,880
 the British Museum had to specifically send in a curator

133
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,400
 because they thought that Oliver Cromwell's death mask

134
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,520
 might melt because it's made of wax,

135
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,360
 and it was so hot in the museum that,

136
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,280
 and that obviously is a very rare and precious thing.

137
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,600
 - But so I assume that even during lockdown,

138
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,200
 there were one or two caretakers

139
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,320
 that were able to walk around the museum,

140
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,160
 because for example, with the problem of no one breathing

141
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,640
 and creating that humidity,

142
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,840
 they do have sensors, over 700 all around the museum,

143
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
 that go off when the temperatures and humidity

144
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,800
 are not at the right level.

145
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,960
 So they can adjust them.

146
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,800
 They can press buttons to make sure that it regulates.

147
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,080
 It's not entirely reliant on humans breathing on them.

148
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,760
 So I would have assumed there just would have been someone

149
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,040
 there to put a hat on Oliver Cromwell's death mask

150
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,880
 or something.

151
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,520
 - I think there are people who can do that.

152
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,400
 They have a few people who go in.

153
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,280
 There's a brilliant interview with James McClain,

154
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,400
 who I think Dan definitely knows, I would say.

155
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,480
 I'm not sure if you guys know him,

156
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,880
 who's the fish curator at the Natural History Museum.

157
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,640
 And it's been his job during lockdown for some of the time

158
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,880
 to go and have a look around

159
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,200
 and make sure that everything's okay.

160
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,960
 So he's had to look after the flesh-eating beetles,

161
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,000
 for instance.

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,400
 So they have these beetles there,

163
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,880
 which strip down the bones.

164
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,280
 Whenever you get a new little animal,

165
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,320
 you put it in and the beetles eat all the meat off it

166
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,400
 and you come out with a perfect bone.

167
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,920
 And he's had to feed them so that they don't go looking

168
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,400
 for other things to eat.

169
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,480
 So he has to give them some conger eel heads

170
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,640
 to keep them happy.

171
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,480
 - Oh my God.

172
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,640
 - And he said something else in this.

173
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,880
 This is not about conservation,

174
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,680
 but I thought it was really interesting.

175
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,640
 He says he monitors the alcohol supply system

176
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,520
 in the Natural History Museum.

177
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,800
 And apparently in the Natural History Museum,

178
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,400
 there is a series of pipes that go through the whole museum.

179
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,280
 Like they're powered by steam power

180
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,920
 and they fire alcohol through the whole museum.

181
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,680
 And there are little taps in all the rooms

182
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,120
 where you can just get little bits of pure alcohol

183
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,000
 if you need it for preservation.

184
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,400
 Isn't that amazing?

185
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,920
 - That is so cool.

186
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,760
 - It's so cool.

187
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,600
 - Can you drink that?

188
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,440
 Or is that too intense?

189
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,840
 - No, it's pure ethanol.

190
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,760
 So I would advise against it.

191
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,200
 If you ever get stuck in the Natural History Museum,

192
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,240
 then probably, you know, there might be--

193
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
 - Don't check the tap.

194
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,360
 - Don't check the tap.

195
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,960
 Go to check out the staff canteen

196
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,320
 if you need some alcohol, probably, rather than the taps.

197
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,880
 Otherwise, you've drunk from an ethanol tap,

198
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,960
 you're absolutely hammered

199
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,160
 and you're in a room surrounded by dead,

200
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,000
 stuffed, giant, extinct animals,

201
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,440
 which sounds like something out of a nightmare.

202
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,360
 - That movie, "The Nice at the Museum"

203
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,720
 is very different if you've been drinking pure ethanol

204
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,560
 the night before.

205
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,440
 - It's quite dangerous having all that ethanol there

206
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,040
 for preservation in the Natural History Museum.

207
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,120
 They have to be careful with bigger animals.

208
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,280
 So I think the head of fish curation,

209
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,560
 who's called Oliver Crimin,

210
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,960
 or he claims to be the head,

211
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,800
 but maybe your friend is his rival.

212
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,640
 - They work together.

213
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,040
 Ollie and James work together, yeah.

214
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,400
 - Okay, work together, rivals,

215
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,320
 whatever you wanna call it.

216
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,000
 (laughing)

217
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,680
 They stuffed their largest fish recently.

218
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,240
 So they've got 900,000 dead fish in there

219
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,560
 and it was a blue marlin, which was four meters long.

220
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,120
 It washed up in Wales in 2016.

221
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,720
 And I just love the fact that within 24 hours,

222
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,120
 Oliver's there on the beach,

223
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,520
 on the Pembrokeshire coast immediately.

224
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,360
 And it needed 10,000 litres of ethanol,

225
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,720
 which is what you'd normally preserve it in,

226
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,600
 but that's incredibly flammable and very dangerous.

227
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,040
 That would explode the entire museum if a flame got to it.

228
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,480
 So they had to sort of create this new solution for it,

229
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,320
 glycerol.

230
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,280
 But it's very cool. - 10,000 litres.

231
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,720
 - Yeah, it's big.

232
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,240
 - How big is a marlin?

233
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,400
 - They're much bigger than I realised.

234
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,120
 They-- - It's like a size of a tuna,

235
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
 isn't it, a marlin?

236
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,920
 - Yeah, marlins are massive.

237
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,000
 - I guess, just that's amazing.

238
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,360
 That is really extraordinary.

239
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,520
 Is one of them, does one of them do the heads of the fish

240
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,120
 and the other one does the tails of the fish?

241
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,040
 - Yeah, but they flip for it on the start of each day

242
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
 to see what does it do.

243
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,720
 (laughing)

244
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,200
 - Just back to the British Museum very quickly.

245
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,600
 What do you suppose the two most popular things

246
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,040
 in the museum, what do you think the two most popular things

247
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,200
 are? - Okay.

248
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,120
 - And I'm getting this from a British Museum blog

249
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,080
 from 2017, so it might have changed since then.

250
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,280
 - Like the mummies, I would say people always go

251
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,560
 for the mummies, don't they?

252
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,400
 - I'd say one of the mummies.

253
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,600
 - Boom, number one, Egyptian collection mummies

254
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,120
 is the number one most searched for thing

255
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,600
 on their website that people wanna find out about.

256
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,440
 So what's number two?

257
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,040
 - For number two, I would say maybe the--

258
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,400
 - Is that a stone, is that in there?

259
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,680
 - Yeah. - Oh, there is a stone, is there?

260
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,440
 - I would say the-- - I'd say the Fiji mermaid.

261
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,760
 - Oh, is that the-- - Is that the Elgin marbles?

262
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,640
 - Oh, the Elgin marbles, yeah, good cool.

263
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,640
 It's actually Japanese erotica, so shunger it's called

264
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,120
 and these are on panels.

265
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,880
 It's a painting of very erotic Japanese

266
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,400
 kind of karma sutra-esque looking drawings

267
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,680
 and there was a big exhibition in 2014,

268
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,440
 the second most searched for thing on their website,

269
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,320
 more so than the opening hours,

270
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,280
 it's called Japanese erotica.

271
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,600
 - No way.

272
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,880
 - It's no good knowing the opening hours

273
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,840
 if you don't know the way to the Japanese erotica.

274
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,280
 - That's what you constantly see,

275
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,480
 very disappointed looking slightly horny people

276
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,520
 at two in the morning,

277
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,720
 looking really angry outside the British Museum.

278
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,840
 Didn't realize they weren't open.

279
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,600
 - Yeah, 40,000 annual searches for shunger on their website

280
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,400
 and the Egyptian collection gets 53,000.

281
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
 - Do we know if that's 40,000 different people

282
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,280
 or is it one unbelievably horny?

283
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,280
 One cool thing during this whole breath thing,

284
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,920
 one of the collections of,

285
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,160
 the head of collections care is a woman called Sandra Smith

286
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,800
 and she said about the breath crisis at the museum,

287
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,120
 she said, "It was not alarming, that's a bit scaremongering,

288
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,720
 "but it's fair to say that when we started

289
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,080
 "watching the moisture dropping,

290
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,440
 "we were all holding our breath

291
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,880
 "and wanting it to normalize."

292
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,280
 (laughing)

293
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,800
 - What, stop it, you idiot.

294
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,400
 (upbeat music)

295
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:20,160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

296
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,000
 - Okay, well, before I say my fact this week,

297
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,200
 I just want to warn any more squeamish listeners

298
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,000
 that it is kind of gruesome,

299
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,320
 but I want to reassure them that it has a happy ending.

300
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,760
 So, steal yourselves.

301
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,960
 - My fact this week is that in 1997,

302
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,360
 a mass tug of war went so badly wrong

303
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,840
 that it ripped two of the contestants' arms off.

304
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,960
 - Anna, no.

305
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,000
 - I'm sorry, all of your guys' faces

306
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,320
 are making me regret this.

307
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,480
 - We knew what you were gonna say, Anna.

308
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,640
 - Exactly, it doesn't make it any better.

309
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,600
 - As I hear it, it gets worse, actually.

310
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,240
 I'm just gonna say immediately,

311
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,440
 before I go anywhere near the rest of this,

312
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,600
 that they had some very extensive microsurgery

313
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,400
 and their arms were reattached

314
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,240
 along with extensive nerve grafting

315
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,600
 and they regained their hand functions, okay?

316
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,200
 So, we're okay to talk about this,

317
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,440
 a tug of war ripped their arms off.

318
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,040
 And that can happen.

319
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,560
 It was actually meant to be a day of celebration.

320
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,520
 It was in Taiwan and it was the anniversary

321
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,880
 of the end of Japanese rule.

322
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,680
 It was to celebrate that.

323
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,720
 And 1600 people took part

324
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,080
 and people don't realize how dangerous tug of war is.

325
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,640
 So, that ended up putting 80,000 kilograms of force

326
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,120
 on this five centimeter wide nylon rope

327
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,520
 that could only bear 26,000.

328
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,160
 So, it was kind of impressive that it hung on that long.

329
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,160
 And the rope snapped and the rebound force of it snapping

330
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,600
 seems to have just torn off the left arms

331
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,320
 of the two people at the front of each row.

332
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,280
 So, it's kind of amazing physics, I guess.

333
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,720
 That massive force is sitting in the rope

334
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,040
 when it's being pulled.

335
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,960
 And as soon as the rope breaks,

336
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,360
 that force has to go somewhere,

337
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,720
 that energy goes somewhere.

338
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,800
 And so, it immediately goes straight into the body

339
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,720
 of the person who's at the front of the row

340
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,880
 who essentially pulls his body away from his arm.

341
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,600
 - I'm so squeamish that I actually didn't do

342
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,720
 any further research on this specific incident

343
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,560
 that happened.

344
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,800
 And so, I assumed that it was just that they got tugged

345
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,040
 at the wrong moment or that like the other 3,000 people

346
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,600
 on the other team all pulled at the same time

347
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
 and only one person had turned up for their own tea

348
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,920
 or whatever.

349
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,320
 (laughing)

350
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,360
 - It was not that.

351
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,560
 - It was interesting 'cause it was a slightly different

352
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,000
 to the normal tug of war, I think, that we have

353
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,600
 in that there were lots of branches that came off the rope.

354
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,400
 So, it wasn't just like, let's say it was 16,000 people.

355
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,480
 It wasn't 8,000 people pulling on one end of the rope

356
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,520
 and 8,000 people on the other.

357
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,240
 All the rope had loads of kind of bits coming off it

358
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,160
 that people would pull on the side.

359
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,960
 'Cause that's the way they do it in Taiwan.

360
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,120
 - Yeah, yeah.

361
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,960
 Depending on your level of squeamishness,

362
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,080
 there is a really good Snopes article on it.

363
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,880
 The picture in which I found extremely confusing.

364
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,920
 So, it does show a man lying on the ground

365
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,200
 after the tug of war next to his arm.

366
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,000
 And then the only other person in shot is a cameraman

367
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,480
 who's sitting there with his back to this man,

368
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,680
 pointing the camera in a completely different direction.

369
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,760
 Now, what I wanna know is, what in God's name

370
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,440
 is he taking a photo of?

371
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
 That is more interesting than that.

372
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
 - Oh, man.

373
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,360
 Well, there were two guys, right?

374
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,480
 Maybe it's the other guy.

375
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,920
 - There were two guys on the arm.

376
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,360
 Imagine coming around after extensive microsurgery,

377
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,920
 hearing the surgeon saying, don't worry,

378
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,040
 we have brilliant medical science these days.

379
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,280
 We've managed to reattach your arm.

380
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,480
 You look down and you think, that's not my watch.

381
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,440
 - This happens a lot, right?

382
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,000
 And not enough that it's a sort of public announcement

383
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,240
 to say, stop doing tug of war.

384
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,200
 But this isn't a one-off.

385
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,560
 There are cases that you can read.

386
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,800
 - Don't say one-off.

387
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,640
 (all laughing)

388
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,000
 - But sadly, in these mass tug of wars,

389
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,120
 people do lose hands.

390
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,960
 In some cases, sadly, some people have died.

391
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,400
 But it's only with these mega, these mega tug of wars.

392
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,880
 - I think one of the problems is that

393
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,400
 in professional tug of war, they have rules, right?

394
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,240
 They have very strict rules of what you're allowed to do

395
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,520
 and what you're not allowed to do.

396
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,240
 If you just get a load of people,

397
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,880
 like 1600 people pulling on a bit of rope,

398
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,800
 they're not gonna necessarily follow

399
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,240
 all the health and safety things.

400
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,760
 The main problem is when you wrap it around yourself

401
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,400
 to kind of pull.

402
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,480
 And that's obviously a problem.

403
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,960
 In a professional tug of war,

404
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,600
 you're not allowed to do that at all.

405
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,240
 - It's amazing how widespread tug of war seems to have been

406
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,560
 throughout history and all around the world, isn't it?

407
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,400
 So in Thailand, it happens at Buddhist funerals,

408
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,200
 I think, in Thailand and Burma.

409
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,320
 And it's only if you're a really high up Buddhist,

410
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,040
 if you're a really senior monk,

411
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,640
 then there's a massive tug of war over your corpse.

412
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,520
 - Not over your actual corpse.

413
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,440
 - Okay, well, it's over your hearse with the corpse on it.

414
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,080
 And this is, it sounds kind of fun.

415
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,440
 Your body's put on a cart and it's pulled to this field

416
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,520
 and it's gonna be cremated.

417
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,240
 But first of all, all the villagers gather around

418
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
 and they pull at the cart on either side.

419
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,200
 Sometimes this goes on for days

420
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
 of just pulling the cart one way

421
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,480
 and then the rope snaps

422
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,760
 and the other team pull it a long way the other way.

423
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,080
 And they get cheerleaders and they have megaphones

424
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,680
 with people kind of egging one team on.

425
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,560
 And with just with this Buddhist monk's body

426
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,280
 rollicking around on the cart for a while.

427
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,120
 - Wow.

428
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,600
 - And I think the idea is that it's a way

429
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,120
 of getting all the goodness out of the monk,

430
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,320
 all the merit they call it before you cremate him.

431
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,920
 And it sounds like an absolute laugh.

432
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,440
 (all laughing)

433
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,800
 - I was reading about professional tug of war

434
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,400
 and the world championships and stuff like that.

435
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,840
 And the best women's team is from Taiwan.

436
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,360
 They are unbelievably good.

437
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,480
 They've won every single world championship to date.

438
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,440
 - Right, wow.

439
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,520
 - But they go under the name of Chinese Taipei

440
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,280
 because obviously there's political things

441
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,000
 between China and the Taiwanese.

442
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,980
 And so they compete under the name Chinese Taipei.

443
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,680
 But whenever they play China,

444
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,920
 they always want to absolutely smash them, okay?

445
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,680
 I read an interview with one of the players

446
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,360
 called Chen Lihui.

447
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,160
 And she said that when she played against the Chinese,

448
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,400
 they could have beaten them really, really quickly.

449
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,960
 And she says, "But instead we tortured them slowly

450
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,160
 before making them lose."

451
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,560
 So they just kind of make it look like

452
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,880
 they're gonna win, look like they're gonna win,

453
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,720
 look like they're gonna win.

454
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,560
 And then they smashed them.

455
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,880
 - Oh, my goodness.

456
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
 - That's amazing.

457
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,080
 - Yeah, I watched a professional tug of war match

458
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,320
 just this morning and it was very different

459
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,040
 to how I pictured it would be.

460
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,720
 As in I thought you would have the gun or whatever go, go off.

461
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,920
 And it would be kind of just kind of a lot of pulling,

462
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,720
 a lot of just, come on, let's do this, a lot of tugging.

463
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
 But what happens in the one that I saw

464
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,400
 and this was a finals and it was, I think it was England

465
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,920
 and someone else, they basically, they started it

466
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,680
 and they go completely rigid.

467
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,240
 They put their feet in, they lock down and they hold

468
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,040
 and they're pulling really hard,

469
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,560
 but there's no movement whatsoever.

470
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,480
 And this match lasted nine minutes long

471
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,120
 and for the first five or so minutes,

472
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,800
 it was just them basically holding firm.

473
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,480
 I think with a tension that I guess it just tires you out

474
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,840
 a bit and then you make your move.

475
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,160
 So it's a sort of, but it's very boring

476
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,440
 for the first five minutes.

477
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,400
 You're just staring at people leaning backwards.

478
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,320
 - I read, it's not a good spectator score.

479
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,560
 Yeah, it's just motionless, motionless, motionless.

480
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,840
 Oh, a load of people have fallen over the end.

481
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,960
 I read one article and this was in the physics website.

482
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,800
 So they weren't going on the sporting side of it,

483
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,440
 but they reckoned that it's just basically about friction.

484
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,480
 It's not even about how strong you are.

485
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,160
 Because if you think about it, if you're pulling on a rope

486
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,600
 which is attached to a wall, you can pull it

487
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
 as hard as you want.

488
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,400
 And if you pull and pull and pull, all you're gonna do

489
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,080
 is move yourself closer to the wall.

490
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
 You're not gonna move the wall

491
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,720
 because the wall is stuck there.

492
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,160
 And so the idea is that if the other team

493
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,760
 has got a really good face and really stuck

494
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,960
 on the floor with good friction with nice solid boots

495
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,160
 and you're on ice, you could be a million times

496
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,560
 stronger than them, but all you're gonna do

497
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,800
 is pull yourself closer to them.

498
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,760
 You're not gonna pull them closer to you.

499
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,440
 - So I read a lot of the Tug of War International

500
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,880
 Federation Rulebook in preparation for this recording.

501
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,400
 Oh my God, they're called TWIFT for short.

502
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,960
 And their rules are so good.

503
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,160
 They're so interesting.

504
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,320
 So there are all kinds of rules.

505
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,520
 There's a whole page about doping in Tug of War.

506
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,280
 Not allowed.

507
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,680
 And there's not much anyway, 'cause why would you?

508
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,520
 - But the rules about shoes--

509
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,280
 - What? 'Cause it makes you stronger, Charlie.

510
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,080
 - Well, but it doesn't give you more friction.

511
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,120
 It doesn't, you know. - Oh, you can't take--

512
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,800
 - You can't take a drug that makes you rough.

513
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,200
 Yeah. (laughing)

514
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,400
 - It would need to be a stickiness.

515
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,720
 You want sticky feet, don't you?

516
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,480
 - Well, this is exactly, this is why the shoes section

517
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,560
 of TWIFT rules is so enormous and comprehensive.

518
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,200
 You aren't allowed to have shoes

519
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,680
 that are more than 20% longer than your feet.

520
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,120
 Because when you think about it, that is--

521
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,200
 - That's why the clouds won the first five Olympics

522
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,640
 didn't they? (laughing)

523
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
 - They would win, wouldn't they?

524
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,280
 Because they've just got so much more surface

525
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,800
 in contact with the ground.

526
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,760
 Like, what?

527
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,720
 And there are all these things you could be banned for.

528
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,280
 You could be banned for sitting down.

529
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,440
 That's happened in, when it was an Olympic sport,

530
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,200
 actually, the British team ones got banned for sitting.

531
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,240
 It's not really sitting down.

532
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,960
 It's falling over. - Well, actually,

533
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,160
 the first ever rules, I read them and explicitly,

534
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,680
 it says sitting on another member of your team

535
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,040
 is not permitted. (laughing)

536
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,600
 - Fair, that is fair.

537
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,360
 - But also not trying hard enough

538
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,800
 is a disqualifiable offense.

539
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,640
 - Really?

540
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,200
 - So it says in the rules,

541
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,280
 teams failing to actively engage in the competitive effort

542
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,720
 during a pull leading to a prolonged stalemate

543
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,280
 which could bring the sport into disrepute.

544
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,280
 - But that's what I was saying, basically,

545
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,160
 what the Chinese Taipei/Taiwanese team were doing.

546
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,560
 Like, deliberately not trying hard to try and make it.

547
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
 - Well, they gotta watch out then, yeah.

548
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,760
 - That's very interesting.

549
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,920
 TWIFT is a wonderful website, by the way.

550
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,760
 - I read the latest newsletter.

551
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,680
 They've just celebrated their 60th anniversary

552
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,200
 as the Tug of War International Federation.

553
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,640
 Sadly, due to COVID, aren't able to meet up

554
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,600
 to be there with each other.

555
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,440
 So they're gonna do it next year.

556
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,280
 - It's the perfect sport.

557
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,120
 It's the perfect sport

558
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,440
 for keeping people at fixed two-meter intervals.

559
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,680
 (laughing)

560
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,320
 - Yeah, so they're gonna be meeting up next year

561
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,320
 for their 60th plus one anniversary in 2021.

562
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,360
 And I was reading their mission statement

563
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,400
 and the mission statement basically is,

564
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,000
 their main objective is they want this

565
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,520
 to become an Olympic sport again.

566
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,920
 They're desperate to get it back in the Olympics

567
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,160
 'cause in the early Olympics,

568
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,240
 they were five Olympics that they were a part of,

569
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,480
 I think, was it?

570
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,640
 1920, I think, was the last that they ever did.

571
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,080
 And Britain, the holders of the,

572
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,720
 well, not necessarily Britain, the holders,

573
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
 because it's actually a very specific bit of Britain.

574
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,000
 It is the city of London police

575
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,840
 who are the reigning Olympic champions of tug of war.

576
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,520
 And yeah, and they're constantly trying

577
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,560
 to get it back into the Olympics,

578
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,600
 but it's not happened yet.

579
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,200
 And I think it should go back in.

580
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,560
 It's no different to the discus.

581
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,440
 It's no different to, yeah, I think it's quite a...

582
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,680
 - Yeah, but it's no different to egg and spoon race

583
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,320
 or that race where you run across,

584
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,040
 put a different item of clothing on each time

585
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,480
 until you look like a farmer.

586
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,000
 That's not the answer.

587
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,040
 - It requires much, much less skill than those.

588
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,360
 It requires being fat and having spikes in your shoes.

589
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,840
 - No, no, no, no.

590
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,840
 It is, it's not just about strength, as we know.

591
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,480
 It's skill as well.

592
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,680
 - No, that's what I'm saying.

593
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,440
 It's not about, it's nothing to do with strength.

594
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,040
 It's about standing there and being heavy.

595
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,080
 - Heavy is nothing to do with it.

596
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,280
 - I found it really interesting

597
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,760
 that we've got two people,

598
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,520
 me and Anna on the side of tug of war is not a skill spot.

599
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,600
 And then we've got you two on the other side

600
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,080
 pulling in your direction.

601
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,520
 - Only one way to settle it.

602
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,640
 - I am pro of the Olympic claim

603
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,440
 because Great Britain did seem to absolutely smash it.

604
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,640
 'Cause not only did the police team win,

605
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,200
 we were allowed to submit various teams.

606
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,880
 And I think Great Britain won all three medals in 1908,

607
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,240
 as well as winning various medals in the race.

608
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,440
 - But it wasn't just Great Britain

609
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,800
 winning all three medals.

610
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,240
 It was specific police forces from Britain winning all three.

611
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,080
 So the city of London took gold,

612
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,320
 Liverpool's police force won silver,

613
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,440
 and then more other London policemen took the bronze medal.

614
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,000
 It could not have been a more decent thing.

615
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,160
 - It was quite controversial though,

616
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,840
 because the Liverpool team,

617
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,240
 there is a suggestion that they were wearing

618
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
 such enormous shoes.

619
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,600
 And according to some people who wrote about it at the time,

620
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,960
 their shoes were so heavy

621
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,160
 that they could only just lift their feet off the floor

622
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,160
 after they had to leave the arena.

623
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,600
 - Well, so if you read the latest newsletter

624
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,680
 from the TWIFT website,

625
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,120
 there's an actual breakdown

626
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,000
 of how a lot of these problems were solved

627
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,920
 by one of the founding members who helped us solve it,

628
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,320
 which is when they had their first international matches,

629
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,200
 every different country had different rules

630
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,160
 for what they were allowed to do,

631
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
 different size shoes, different grips,

632
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,880
 different laying down on stuff.

633
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,840
 And so it was this guy who writes his historical piece

634
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,680
 in the newsletter,

635
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,040
 who says that he got together with everyone

636
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,600
 and they sort of internationalized the rules for tug of war,

637
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,280
 so that there's now one solid way

638
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,160
 that if you enter this competition,

639
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,320
 you can only perform it.

640
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,000
 - I really hope that the TWIFT website

641
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,600
 gets a massive spike in visitors.

642
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,560
 If you're listening to this,

643
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,480
 just please go to the TWIFT website

644
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,160
 'cause I want whoever runs the TWIFT website

645
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,000
 to say, like, phone his colleagues,

646
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,520
 it's finally happening, we're doing it.

647
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,720
 - TWIFT just sounds like a swear word you use

648
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,960
 when you've got a toddler around

649
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
 so you can't say the actual word, doesn't it?

650
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,640
 It's an absolute TWIFT.

651
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,640
 I think that there should just be the prerequisite

652
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,760
 that if you cannot mount the podiums to claim your medal

653
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,240
 'cause your shoes are too heavy,

654
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,560
 that's automatic disqualification.

655
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,480
 - I'll just chuck it down here, that's fine.

656
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,280
 - Imagine the very start of the Olympics

657
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,880
 where they're all marching around the stadium

658
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,480
 with a big flag and you've just got the tug of war

659
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,360
 so you're dragging their feet along.

660
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,960
 Here they come, the tug of war competitors.

661
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,040
 It always slows down for this bit.

662
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,040
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James.

663
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,320
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in medieval elections,

664
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,120
 you were supposed to object to any suggestion

665
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,640
 that you wanted to win.

666
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,080
 When he became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1093,

667
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,880
 St. Anselm refused to accept the ceremonial staff

668
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,040
 so they had to break his fingers to force it into his hand.

669
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,880
 - Come on.

670
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,760
 - This is, and if you go on Snopes,

671
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,680
 you can see photographs of the hand being broken.

672
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,640
 - No, obviously not.

673
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,840
 - There's a scribe looking at something else.

674
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,840
 What is he looking at?

675
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:57,000
 - So I read this from BBC History Magazine.

676
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,480
 It's an article by Professor Bjorn Weiler

677
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,320
 from Aberystwyth University

678
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,880
 and it's about medieval elections

679
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,920
 that took place around that time.

680
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,080
 And there were always elections for things like bishops

681
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,000
 and archbishops and popes and councils and stuff like that.

682
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,680
 Sometimes also kings, some kings were elected,

683
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,720
 which I didn't know.

684
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,560
 But the idea was that whoever won

685
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,560
 was gonna be whatever God wanted.

686
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,720
 And you shouldn't really want to have power over other people

687
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,840
 if you're a holy good person.

688
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,240
 And so you wouldn't try and go around

689
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,520
 getting people to vote for you or anything like that.

690
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,320
 It was really, really looked down on.

691
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,720
 You should just accept the nomination, accept the win

692
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,920
 and say, well, I didn't really want this,

693
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,160
 but since you insist, I'm gonna do it.

694
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,640
 And then Saint Anselm, he got the archbishopship of Canterbury

695
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,600
 and they had to give him the staff as part of the ceremony,

696
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,720
 but he was like, no, I'm still gonna pretend

697
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,240
 that I don't want this.

698
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,080
 And they had to break it.

699
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,120
 - You'll have to force that ceremonial staff

700
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,520
 into my dead hands.

701
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,040
 - Oh, so he was definitely acting?

702
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,960
 - Well, actually probably not, 'cause he was a saint.

703
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,320
 And if you believe all the stories about Saint Anselm,

704
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,120
 he was an extremely pious man who didn't want any...

705
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,600
 It's funny 'cause he's quite a famous saint

706
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,000
 and he did lots of cool stuff, but all the way through,

707
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,080
 it's like, oh, no, I don't really want anyone

708
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,040
 to know who I am, oh, no.

709
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,000
 Like he deliberately went to become the number two

710
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,760
 of a very famous monk, because the other guy was so famous,

711
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,960
 he thought that will deflect all the fame off me.

712
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,320
 - He's like the two fish curators

713
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,520
 at the Natural History Museum is what we're saying.

714
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,120
 (all laughing)

715
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,520
 I love, it's such a funny, although he wouldn't have been

716
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,720
 a saint at the time, I guess.

717
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,560
 He would have just been Mr. Anselm.

718
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,920
 - So, yeah, probably not Mr. Anselm.

719
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,680
 - Yeah, Mr. Anselm.

720
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,560
 - We should just say, he obviously set an example

721
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,160
 that a lot of world leaders follow today

722
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,800
 in his reluctance for power.

723
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,720
 I like Anselm because he's the father of scholasticism,

724
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,080
 so which was a massive deal,

725
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,040
 which was basically the biggest intellectual movement

726
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,480
 of the late middle ages.

727
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,640
 Stop laughing, Andy, that's not why I like him.

728
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,460
 (all laughing)

729
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,700
 - I'm not an absolute no, okay?

730
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,720
 So, scholasticism was this very important new wave thing,

731
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,100
 which was using logic and reason and debate

732
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,640
 to justify religious arguments

733
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,840
 instead of just monasticism

734
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,600
 where you bought everything you read in the Bible

735
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,640
 without questioning it.

736
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,220
 Anyway, the reason I raise it is

737
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,180
 'cause the most famous scholastic

738
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,600
 is one of my favorite people, who's Peter Abelard,

739
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,880
 who was the guy who was inspired by Anselm,

740
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,700
 and he was the leading philosopher of the 12th century,

741
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,420
 really arrogant, bit of a pain,

742
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,400
 argued with his teachers all the time,

743
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,280
 totally uninterested in women

744
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,400
 'cause all about his study,

745
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,480
 and then suddenly decided he really wanted

746
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,320
 to be the best juicer on the face of the earth.

747
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,160
 So, fell in love with this woman called Eloise,

748
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,120
 and shagged her in the convent kitchen

749
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,200
 and in her uncle's bedroom, and then he married her,

750
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,040
 but he also wanted to get a religious post,

751
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,760
 so he married her in secret,

752
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,460
 and her uncle thought that he'd refused to marry her.

753
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,380
 There was all a bit of a misunderstanding,

754
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,140
 and her uncle did what any good uncle would do

755
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,900
 and sent some men round to chop his bulls off,

756
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,740
 and so--

757
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,180
 - And they're now hanging in the penis museum in Iceland.

758
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,380
 - Here we go, leave it alone, Anna!

759
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,220
 He missed the episode, get over it!

760
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,800
 (all laughing)

761
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,540
 - Sorry, Anna. - I'm perfectly preserved.

762
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,300
 - This is why you like St. Anselm.

763
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,420
 - Because he was an excuse for me to delve back

764
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,560
 into our vlog, my favourite person of the 12th century.

765
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,640
 I just love that you've got your testicles chopped off

766
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,960
 over a misunderstanding.

767
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,800
 - That's terrible.

768
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,020
 - Yeah, St. Anselm's father was called Gandalf.

769
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,280
 - No, no, no. - No, stop it, yeah.

770
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,480
 Gandalf. - No.

771
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,640
 - I guess we only think that's funny,

772
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,840
 'cause Tolkien then went on to use the name,

773
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,720
 'cause presumably, but that is hilarious.

774
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,360
 - Yeah, yeah, hands up, that's why I find that funny.

775
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,940
 (all laughing)

776
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,040
 I'm not gonna hide it.

777
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,200
 Gandalf, ironically though, loved his ceremonial star.

778
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,040
 - That's true.

779
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,480
 - Whereas Anselm, of course, not a fan.

780
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,320
 - That's true.

781
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,180
 - Anselm once was in church with Henry I,

782
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,340
 and he issued the decree of excommunication

783
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,740
 against people who had long hair,

784
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,420
 because long curly hair had become fashionable in court,

785
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,700
 and he did a sermon that was so convincing

786
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,700
 that several of the people with long hair in the church

787
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,380
 burst into tears and pulled out their hair

788
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,380
 by its roots, and the king also started crying,

789
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,040
 and one of his assistants had a pair of scissors

790
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,140
 and chopped off the king's hair there and then.

791
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,540
 - Wow, that's convincing, that's good rhetoric.

792
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,180
 - That is.

793
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:46,360
 - So just on these sort of medieval strange elections

794
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,760
 that happened, and sort of the strangeness of their structure,

795
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,360
 and how, you know, have you guys heard about the elections

796
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,320
 in the Venetian Republic?

797
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,160
 - No.

798
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,980
 - Oh, no.

799
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,980
 - Okay, so medieval Venice was led by the doge, DOGE,

800
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,860
 and the doge was elected by the great council of Venice, okay?

801
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,100
 This is a huge council, had lots and lots of members,

802
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,500
 and it was run by a few noble families,

803
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,260
 but it had, you know, hundreds of members,

804
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,660
 and everyone wanted to be the doge,

805
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,820
 obviously very powerful,

806
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,260
 but the system was designed very carefully

807
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,140
 to stop anyone gaining and keeping power, okay?

808
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,900
 So you had to stop people consolidating their authority

809
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,960
 once they were elected doge, you know?

810
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,680
 So it sort of keeps things in balance.

811
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,520
 So this is how they elected a doge, right?

812
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,040
 You pick 30 members of the great council at random, okay?

813
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,640
 Then you pick nine of those 30, also at random, okay?

814
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,440
 You're trying to pick the electing body here.

815
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,960
 You've got nine people.

816
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,240
 - How are you picking them at random?

817
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,680
 You're just sort of throwing a bouquet or something.

818
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,920
 - Names out of a hat, yeah.

819
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,880
 - Those nine members, they then select 40 more members, right?

820
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,260
 Then of those 40, 12 are randomly picked.

821
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,220
 Those 12 choose 25 more,

822
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,860
 who are randomly cut down to nine, okay?

823
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,220
 Those nine then choose another 45,

824
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,780
 of whom 11 are picked at random.

825
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,620
 And then those 11 choose 41 more.

826
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,920
 Those 41 then vote for the doge.

827
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,100
 - Wow. - Exactly.

828
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,940
 - And can I ask,

829
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,740
 what proportion was done by postal voting?

830
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,780
 'Cause if there's any more than 10,

831
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,300
 I don't believe a word of it.

832
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,260
 - I, just reading into some of these mad elections,

833
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,260
 there was that classic one of

834
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,100
 after Pope Clement IV died.

835
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,100
 They spent three years trying to decide

836
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,260
 on who the new Pope was.

837
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,340
 And it took so long that eventually

838
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,900
 the citizens of the area got so angry, so pissed off,

839
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,960
 they locked all of the people voting into a church,

840
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,500
 and they refused to feed them anything.

841
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,780
 So they're just like, get in there,

842
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,900
 decide on this, no food, no water,

843
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,900
 and they even ripped off the roof of the church

844
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,340
 so that the elements could rain on them and so on,

845
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,740
 just until they had that decision.

846
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,140
 And they finally did get that decision.

847
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,620
 Pope Gregory X.

848
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,580
 - We should say that that instance that you're describing

849
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,980
 is the reason that paper elections and conclaves

850
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,340
 happen as they do today, right?

851
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,900
 Conclave means with keys.

852
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,140
 And that goes back to that time

853
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,100
 where they had to lock them in the bloody church.

854
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,980
 - So the new rule said that after three days of voting,

855
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,020
 you then, you only get one meal per day from then on.

856
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,220
 Then after eight days, you only get bread and water,

857
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,980
 plus a little wine, apparently, just softened it.

858
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,380
 But the next two popes were elected under those rules.

859
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,860
 And amazingly, they both took under 10 days to decide

860
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,660
 because the food rules have been changed, that was it.

861
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,660
 - But then in 1292, it took two years again to get a pope.

862
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,500
 - Yeah, the rules fell apart again.

863
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,420
 - They all, yeah. - So they instituted

864
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,060
 the rules and then they stopped obeying them

865
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,500
 for quite a long time. - Yeah, and then that time,

866
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,820
 they only elected a pope because a pissed off hermit

867
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,940
 wrote into them, warning them of divine vengeance

868
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,220
 that if they didn't elect the pope,

869
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,500
 and when his letter came in,

870
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,020
 one of the brothers who picked it up went,

871
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,500
 "Well, let's just make this guy the pope."

872
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,620
 And they did, not the hermit.

873
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,060
 - Yeah, he tried to run away, didn't he?

874
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,740
 He genuinely didn't want to.

875
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,540
 I think he was legit, Pietro Damoroni, who was,

876
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,180
 yeah, he wrote to them being like, decide, they picked him.

877
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,700
 He tried to flee, they stopped him,

878
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,180
 they forced him to go into power.

879
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,060
 And only one edict that he passed

880
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,700
 when he was in power as pope remained in force.

881
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,980
 And that was the edict he passed

882
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,620
 that was the right for a pope to abdicate,

883
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,420
 which he did within five months.

884
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,260
 - Yeah.

885
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,540
 - Sometimes you can protest too much.

886
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,180
 In the 1190s, in very St. Edmunds,

887
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,700
 they were looking for a new abbot.

888
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,100
 And there was a few different candidates,

889
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,500
 but of course they were all,

890
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,340
 "Oh no, I don't want it, I don't want it."

891
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,380
 But then one of them was really loudly and annoyingly saying,

892
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,860
 "No, I don't want it, anyone, don't vote for me."

893
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,100
 "Whatever you do, don't vote for me."

894
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,700
 And everyone thought that really,

895
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,100
 he was actually campaigning

896
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,740
 'cause he was like shouting a lot

897
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,660
 and like making himself seen.

898
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,300
 And everyone thought that really,

899
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,900
 he was taking the piss a little bit.

900
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,740
 And then he was killed by a collapsing beam,

901
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,780
 which all the other priests saw as a sign from God,

902
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,380
 but yep, he was definitely,

903
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,220
 he was definitely taking the piss.

904
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,700
 - Did all the other priests have to bury the chainsaws

905
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,700
 that they brought to that meeting very quickly?

906
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,180
 - I would love it if political campaigns

907
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,540
 the day just involved the politicians

908
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,300
 all insisting loudly they didn't want it.

909
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,660
 - It would be fun.

910
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,700
 - It would be fun.

911
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,220
 - If they were trying to force your hand

912
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,820
 onto the Bible at the inauguration

913
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,500
 and he was saying, "No, I don't want, no,

914
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,980
 I'm not touching it, no."

915
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,980
 (laughing)

916
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,260
 - Used to be like that in America.

917
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,500
 So when Horace Greeley ran against

918
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,740
 Ulysses S. Grant in 1872,

919
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,700
 he was the first one who went across a whole country,

920
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,380
 kind of canvassing for votes.

921
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,940
 And all Grant's team, they just mocked him for it.

922
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,780
 And they said, "Look, this is just,

923
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,900
 I can't believe what you're doing.

924
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,100
 This is not the right way to want to become president.

925
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,020
 If you want a president who is a humble man,

926
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,780
 we don't want someone who's shouting

927
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,740
 from the rooftops that I'm the best."

928
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,980
 - God, that's interesting.

929
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,820
 And when was that?

930
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,860
 That was kind of 1880 odd or?

931
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,260
 - 1872, yeah.

932
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,060
 - Sorry, okay, yeah.

933
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,860
 - And actually it's still the rule in America really,

934
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,260
 or it's supposed to be that if you're going to be

935
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,540
 the running mate of a potential president,

936
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,300
 then you're not supposed to campaign for that.

937
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,020
 And that's now you're not supposed to do that.

938
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,580
 So whenever, yeah, when Joe Biden was looking

939
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,940
 for his running mate and he said,

940
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,340
 "I'm definitely going to have a woman.

941
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,180
 We don't know who it is yet,

942
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,460
 but I'll definitely be a woman."

943
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,860
 Obviously all of the journalists would ask

944
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,100
 all of the main probable candidates,

945
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,300
 would you be up for it?

946
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,260
 And a couple of them said,

947
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,500
 "Yeah, I'd definitely be up for it."

948
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,300
 And then a lot of the commentators in America said,

949
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,300
 "Well, that's not really on.

950
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,460
 You're not really supposed to do that.

951
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,300
 You're supposed to say,

952
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,580
 "Well, if it comes my way, I'll see what happens,

953
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,620
 but I'm really, I'm concentrating on campaigning

954
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,020
 for the president and stuff like that."

955
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,340
 - I guess that still happens, doesn't it?

956
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,020
 Like in British politics,

957
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,860
 they say, "Do you want to be prime minister?"

958
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,140
 And they say, "No, I'm doing the job."

959
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,420
 - That's what Rishi Sunak says every week, isn't it?

960
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,260
 - Yeah.

961
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,100
 (all laughing)

962
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,380
 - It's so transparent.

963
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,300
 I wonder if it was as grotesquely transparent

964
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,500
 as this in the olden days,

965
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,580
 when even the nice ones, you know, AOC and people,

966
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,300
 no, it wouldn't cross my mind, be president.

967
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,740
 No, I don't, I just, I'm just here for the people,

968
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,740
 for the do good thing.

969
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,980
 I wish someone would just say,

970
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,420
 the only reason I'm in this job

971
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,100
 is to achieve ultimate power.

972
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,940
 (all laughing)

973
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,020
 - I've just got one more thing

974
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,860
 about electoral malpractice.

975
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,220
 This is actually a recent story,

976
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,700
 got sent to me on Twitter by Kata Ovary.

977
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,340
 So thank you to you.

978
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,020
 This is about the New Zealand Bird of the Year competition,

979
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,980
 which has identified 1500 fraudulent votes.

980
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,900
 So there has been voter fraud in one election this year.

981
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,300
 - Can I just ask,

982
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,220
 how often in the New Zealand Bird of the Year

983
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,460
 the competition does the Kiwi not win?

984
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,820
 'Cause it feels like-

985
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,940
 - I had no idea, the field is wide open.

986
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,780
 - Really? - It's amazing.

987
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,540
 Yeah, I mean, in this case,

988
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,540
 there was a lot of tampering

989
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,620
 on behalf of the little spotted Kiwi,

990
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,060
 which got 1500 fraudulent votes,

991
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,580
 got pushed to the top of the leaderboard,

992
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,780
 they've been removed, but no, it's wide open.

993
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,700
 So, and this is not the first time

994
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,780
 this election has been tampered with.

995
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,700
 So there's a whole report about this in Vice,

996
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,740
 which said this, in 2015,

997
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,780
 two teenage girls tried to rig the results

998
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,620
 in favour of the cock-a-co.

999
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,780
 In 2017, a number of fake email accounts were created

1000
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,340
 to boost the polls in favour of the white-faced Heron.

1001
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,900
 And in 2018, someone voted for the shag

1002
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,940
 more than 3,000 times.

1003
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,100
 (all laughing)

1004
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,460
 - I didn't even know Boris Johnson was in New Zealand.

1005
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,580
 (all laughing)

1006
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,500
 - That's the same guy Googling Shinga,

1007
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,820
 the British New Zealand West, I don't know.

1008
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,400
 (upbeat music)

1009
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,660
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

1010
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,900
 And that is my fact.

1011
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,300
 My fact this week is that the reason America

1012
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,140
 has a national anthem is down to Robert Ripley,

1013
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,540
 believe it or not.

1014
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,260
 - Mm, that's very clever wording,

1015
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,980
 'cause who's gonna think we'll believe it or not?

1016
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,180
 - I felt yucky saying that, it looked fine on the page.

1017
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,820
 When it came out of my mouth, that was a bit weird.

1018
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,300
 So, Robert Ripley, the creator of the very famous

1019
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,880
 Believe It or Not series of books and museums

1020
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,880
 around the world, wrote in 1929 that the star-spangled banner

1021
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,420
 had never actually formally been adopted by America

1022
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,460
 as the national anthem.

1023
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,940
 It was used in lots of ceremonies,

1024
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,120
 it was done everywhere, and he got a lot of angry mail

1025
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,860
 from that saying, "How dare you say that?"

1026
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,020
 Until it was realized that actually constitutionally,

1027
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,480
 it wasn't officially their anthem.

1028
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,540
 So, five million people signed a petition

1029
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,320
 that was forwarded onto Congress.

1030
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,060
 And eventually in 1931, President Hoover signed a law

1031
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,000
 to say this is officially recognized now.

1032
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,060
 So, yeah, it's down to Ripley.

1033
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,960
 - Amazing. - Thank you, Ripley.

1034
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,520
 - Just thanks to Ripley, interestingly.

1035
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,640
 So, it had to be proposed that law by a representative.

1036
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,280
 And it was the man who proposed that was called John Lindtikum.

1037
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,400
 And he represented parts of Baltimore,

1038
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,480
 which is what this song is about, isn't it?

1039
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,240
 It's about a fort, Fort McHenry in Baltimore.

1040
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,880
 So, get this, Lindtikum himself, the politician,

1041
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,540
 his first wife was a woman called Eugenia Mae Biden,

1042
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,660
 who appears from what I can tell

1043
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,660
 to be a relative of Joe Biden, distant relative.

1044
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,420
 - No way. - No way.

1045
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,900
 - Yeah, I don't know about a distant relative.

1046
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,060
 I mean, he is quite old,

1047
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,420
 so she might just be his older sister or something.

1048
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,460
 (all laughing)

1049
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,740
 But yeah, that's amazing.

1050
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,780
 - He should have made more of that in his campaign.

1051
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,300
 He might have actually clinched the bloody election properly.

1052
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,860
 He emphasizes connections to the national anthem.

1053
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,120
 - Okay, Donald Jr.

1054
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,320
 (all laughing)

1055
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,920
 - It was actually signed as the national anthem

1056
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,320
 in an executive order by Woodrow Wilson

1057
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
 about 20 years earlier, wasn't it?

1058
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,920
 But it hadn't been properly rubber stamped by Congress.

1059
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,360
 And it was in 1931 that they rubber stamped it.

1060
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,800
 So, it was kind of a half law when Ripley did this

1061
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,400
 and then it became a full, straight on law in 1931.

1062
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,680
 - Yeah, and his piece that he did,

1063
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,940
 so this was, he used to do illustrations

1064
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,860
 that would sort of have little bits of writing

1065
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,300
 around it to tell you this fact.

1066
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,460
 And in his original illustration,

1067
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,420
 it was a bit controversial,

1068
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,740
 the wording that he used for it,

1069
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,580
 because he said, "America has no national anthem."

1070
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,340
 So that was his big headline statement.

1071
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,180
 Then he said, "The USA, brackets being a dry country,"

1072
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,220
 'cause of course prohibition at the time,

1073
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,620
 "has been using, without authorization,

1074
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,940
 "a vulgar old English drinking song."

1075
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,920
 So, he was sort of doubling down on not only is it not our song,

1076
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,140
 but it's completely against what our government stands for

1077
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,820
 at the moment, pencil the sort of outrage.

1078
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,420
 - But wait, so then he petitioned to have the vulgar old

1079
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,920
 English drinking song actually formally institutes.

1080
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,940
 - No, that was separate to him.

1081
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,680
 He just, this was him putting out a fact.

1082
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,440
 This was people randomly realizing we need to petition.

1083
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,260
 He didn't push that at all.

1084
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,760
 - But then they did adopt the drinking song,

1085
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
 of course, didn't they?

1086
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,880
 - Yeah, exactly.

1087
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,100
 - Because the Star Spangled Banner,

1088
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,200
 the tune came from a society in the London Dintic

1089
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,740
 called the Anacriotic Society,

1090
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,840
 which was like a drinking club on the Strand

1091
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,800
 and in various parts of London.

1092
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,120
 And you would go down and you would drink

1093
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,440
 and you would sing this song.

1094
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,880
 - It sort of sounded like an 18th century

1095
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,720
 Bullingdon Club a little bit, didn't it?

1096
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,560
 - Yeah.

1097
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,480
 - A gentleman hanging out drinking,

1098
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,960
 except for actually not as fun,

1099
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,480
 because they met once a month.

1100
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,360
 And it was fun on the one hand,

1101
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,440
 but it did start with a three hour long instrumental concert

1102
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,040
 to have your supper.

1103
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,080
 - No.

1104
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,680
 - Yeah, they dropped that.

1105
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,400
 - And then it only lasted a few years.

1106
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,000
 It came to an end when the Duchess of Devonshire

1107
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 attended one of the meetings.

1108
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,240
 And then they started singing some of these

1109
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,200
 quite ribald songs.

1110
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,040
 And she was not very happy about it at all.

1111
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,840
 And it wasn't just that she wasn't very happy.

1112
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,680
 It was that the people singing them felt

1113
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,720
 that they couldn't really sing these rude songs

1114
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,040
 in front of a lady.

1115
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,040
 And so they slowly stopped singing them.

1116
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,200
 And then resigned one after another that same night.

1117
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,600
 And just all went, no, no, actually,

1118
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,880
 I'm not doing this anymore.

1119
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,200
 And one after another, they all left until

1120
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,640
 there was only a couple of people left

1121
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,280
 and the Duchess of Devonshire.

1122
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,120
 And the Duchess of--

1123
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,960
 - What a buzz kill.

1124
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,040
 - I know, I know.

1125
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,840
 I mean, the thing is that she really wasn't a buzz kill.

1126
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,800
 Like Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire,

1127
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,000
 she was the great, great, great, great aunt

1128
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,080
 of Diana Princess of Wales.

1129
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,600
 And she was really famous for being kind of a bit out there

1130
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,600
 as far as Duchesses were concerned.

1131
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,040
 She was always drinking, she was gambling.

1132
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,240
 She got in real trouble in the election in 1974

1133
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,240
 because of claims that she was trading kisses for votes.

1134
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,080
 - Oh, really?

1135
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,280
 - Guy Fox, yeah. - Not 1974, presumably.

1136
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,560
 1774?

1137
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,360
 - Well, weirdly, it's 1784.

1138
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,400
 So I'm not sure.

1139
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,120
 I got the one in the far right in that.

1140
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,240
 - That's all that matters.

1141
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,640
 - But yeah, apparently she said

1142
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,200
 that she would kiss a particular butcher

1143
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,840
 if he voted for this Guy Fox.

1144
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,400
 And then supporters of William Pitt said,

1145
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,040
 well, that is just basically a kins of prostitution.

1146
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,160
 So this is gonna be a massive scandal

1147
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,640
 and it became a massive scandal.

1148
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,160
 Although it seems when we look at it now

1149
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,040
 from the future, it looks like perhaps it wasn't even her

1150
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,360
 who was saying this, it might have been her sister.

1151
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,000
 - Wait, was her sister saying, I will kiss the butcher?

1152
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,800
 Or was she saying, I'll get my sister,

1153
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,160
 the Duchess of Devonshire to kiss you, Mr Butcher?

1154
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,720
 - What I believe happened is the sister said,

1155
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,960
 I'll kiss the butcher if you vote for Fox.

1156
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,120
 And the papers thought it was the Duchess of Devonshire

1157
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:22,960
 who'd done this.

1158
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,480
 - Oh, so the sister was like the dodgy relative

1159
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,320
 who's dragging down a proper political campaign.

1160
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,200
 - Kind of, yeah.

1161
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,840
 Although really it was just an excuse

1162
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,920
 for the Pitt team to just, you know.

1163
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,360
 - Yeah, it's such an ineffective method

1164
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,920
 of winning an election as well.

1165
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,520
 If you have to transport someone around the country,

1166
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,600
 kissing everyone, every butcher, yeah.

1167
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,480
 - Did this poor butcher end up getting a kiss for God's sake

1168
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,720
 from the Duchess or her sister?

1169
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,760
 That's what I wanna know.

1170
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,880
 Everyone forgets about the butcher in this story.

1171
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,960
 - The butcher did, the butcher got a kiss.

1172
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,600
 - Thank God. - And I think that was,

1173
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,880
 if she had just said, I might give you a kiss if you vote,

1174
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,320
 then it might not have been so bad,

1175
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,640
 but it was the fact that she did the kiss

1176
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,640
 and then he voted.

1177
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,240
 So they were like, yeah, that's bang on prostitution.

1178
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,480
 - She was, she was a cool dude though.

1179
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,360
 It must have been a really bad song for it to put her off.

1180
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,200
 I think if you were ashamed to sing a song in front

1181
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,040
 of the Duchess, then actually,

1182
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,720
 you shouldn't have been singing the song in the first place.

1183
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,080
 - Yeah, but it's very hard, isn't it,

1184
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,440
 to sing the star-spangled banner.

1185
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,680
 So I've never actually had a crack at it,

1186
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,920
 but apparently it's got 19 semitones in it

1187
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,440
 and it's just such an inappropriate song

1188
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,240
 for almost everybody's vocal range.

1189
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,920
 And mostly when you're watching someone sing it,

1190
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,720
 you're just thinking, are they gonna hit the high note

1191
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,880
 or not?

1192
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,720
 - Yeah.

1193
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,560
 - I was written by a guy called John Stafford Smith

1194
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,440
 when he was still a teenager.

1195
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,240
 He was a lay vicar of Westminster

1196
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,400
 and he died at the age of 85

1197
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,480
 from a grape pip lodged in his windpipe.

1198
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,320
 - No.

1199
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,160
 - Well, can I say something about this?

1200
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,080
 - Yeah.

1201
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,800
 - I wasted a day, I think, trying to track this down.

1202
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,960
 So John Stafford Smith, who incidentally never claimed

1203
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,880
 that he'd written the anthem,

1204
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,280
 refused to acknowledge he'd written it,

1205
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,160
 even though everyone in the society was like,

1206
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,800
 yeah mate, you wrote this.

1207
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,800
 Now, there's like various books say that the way he died

1208
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,960
 was aged 85 or 86, from a grape pip lodged in his throat.

1209
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,640
 But the society, the Anachronian society,

1210
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,320
 was named after this ancient Greek poet, Anachron,

1211
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,560
 sixth century BC poet, who also, according to Pliny the Elder,

1212
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,840
 died from choking on a grape pip at the age of 85 or 86.

1213
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,600
 Now, this is too much of a coincidence to be possible.

1214
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,440
 - No, come on.

1215
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,040
 - Someone has cocked up those sources.

1216
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,080
 - You're too skeptical.

1217
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,840
 It's definitely, you know, they're both famous drinkers.

1218
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,880
 They drank wine.

1219
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,240
 What's wine made out of?

1220
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,080
 Great.

1221
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,440
 - It was one of the leading causes of death

1222
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,720
 for the over 80s, quite recently.

1223
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,480
 - For about 3,000 years, wasn't it?

1224
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,800
 It was, it was.

1225
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,880
 Back in the days when you still had pips in the wine,

1226
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,000
 it's nice that we get pitted wine now, isn't it?

1227
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,920
 - So the old vicar, sorry,

1228
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,560
 he's the one who wrote the original,

1229
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,160
 did he write the original lyrics?

1230
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,200
 Or did he write the tune?

1231
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,520
 - He wrote the tune. - No, the tune.

1232
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,720
 - Sorry, oh yeah.

1233
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,400
 So when I was talking about the semitones thing,

1234
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,320
 that's about the modern song.

1235
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,480
 - Yeah, yeah.

1236
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,800
 So that was written by a guy called Francis Scott Key.

1237
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,080
 And he was 35 years old at the time

1238
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,360
 when he was on a British ship in the Baltimore Harbor

1239
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,160
 and there was the bombing of Fort McHenry.

1240
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,320
 And he was watching as all the bombs went down and so on.

1241
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,880
 And it was in the dawn's early light

1242
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,960
 that he saw this massive flag,

1243
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,240
 the stars and stripes still flying there

1244
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,920
 from this vantage point on the boat.

1245
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,640
 And he just found it so amazing

1246
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,240
 that he wrote down these lyrics for not that song

1247
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,600
 just as a poem and it got published in a paper

1248
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,120
 and it got adapted then by someone else

1249
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,600
 into that song that we now have.

1250
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,080
 - Seriously weird moment for him

1251
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,960
 because the way it happened was he,

1252
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,200
 the war of 1812 was happening in 1814, as it did.

1253
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,880
 And he boarded a British ship

1254
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,920
 to try and negotiate the release of this doctor guy

1255
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,760
 who was a good guy,

1256
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,680
 who treated lots of British soldiers very well.

1257
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,320
 So he boarded this British ship,

1258
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,240
 said, "Look, give us our doctor back, he's a nice man."

1259
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,400
 And the British guy on the ship,

1260
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,960
 the British general, British Admiral said,

1261
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,000
 "Yeah, absolutely, you have the doctor.

1262
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,520
 "Would you mind just waiting a day

1263
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,800
 "because we are about to bomb the absolute shit

1264
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,320
 "out of this harbor right in front of us?"

1265
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,840
 And so he then has to sit on the ship

1266
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:23,800
 while all the Brits on there sort of flatten his homeland.

1267
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,520
 And then, yeah, I guess what else can he do

1268
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,960
 except write this poem.

1269
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,280
 But the fun thing about it is the flag,

1270
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,800
 probably wasn't actually the same flag

1271
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,160
 that was flying the next morning.

1272
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,880
 This is according to the History Channel.

1273
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,960
 - No. - So when it's like,

1274
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,560
 you know, for just a second,

1275
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,360
 you see by the dawn's early light,

1276
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,920
 the flag that you're looking at

1277
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,680
 is actually a new flag they erected that morning

1278
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,360
 because the actual flag was so massive

1279
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,720
 and it was pouring with rain the night of the battle.

1280
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,400
 It would have been wet and it would have weighed 500 pounds,

1281
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,240
 well, then 500 pounds,

1282
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,000
 which would have snapped the flagpole.

1283
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,680
 So actually they had to do a replacement mini flag

1284
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,160
 while the battle was going on.

1285
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,160
 And then overnight, the flag erectors got the massive flag back

1286
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,440
 and hauled it up the flagpole.

1287
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,640
 And so in the morning,

1288
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,680
 it was the replaced large flag that he was looking at.

1289
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,200
 So it hadn't even stayed there during the battle.

1290
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,600
 It's a full song, guys.

1291
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,320
 - This show hasn't even gone out yet.

1292
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,920
 And already I can hear the fury

1293
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,120
 of the Americans listening to this episode.

1294
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,280
 I just hear it in my ears.

1295
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,720
 Let's get to get us right there.

1296
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,280
 - Shall we talk about Ripley instead,

1297
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,560
 who's a great American?

1298
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,400
 - Yeah.

1299
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,520
 - So yeah, Ripley, believe it or not,

1300
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,240
 started as a cartoonist, had a bit of spare time

1301
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,080
 and so drew some cartoons of crazy things

1302
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,240
 that athletes had done.

1303
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,760
 And that became really, really popular.

1304
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,240
 And so the next year he did another one.

1305
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,440
 And then a few years later,

1306
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,840
 he started doing more and more and more

1307
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,400
 of these amazing, unbelievable feats

1308
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,920
 that people had done and illustrating them himself.

1309
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,880
 And then eventually that became, believe it or not.

1310
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,160
 - He's basically a one-man QI, it's so interesting.

1311
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,240
 And he loved doing the thing that QI loves to do,

1312
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,280
 which is to debunk commonly accepted truths,

1313
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,720
 hence the national anthem thing.

1314
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,840
 But the brilliant thing about him was how much post he got,

1315
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,640
 'cause he was known as Rip, Robert Ripley.

1316
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,040
 And people would write to him in a series

1317
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,920
 of elaborate codes.

1318
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,800
 So they would write his address backwards

1319
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,960
 or upside down or in Braille,

1320
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,920
 or they'd draw it on in semaphore flags.

1321
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,720
 Some people apparently would put a very slight tear

1322
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,520
 in the letter, right, i.e. a small rip.

1323
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,240
 And they would then post that and see if it got to him.

1324
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,920
 Anyway, this became so popular

1325
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,040
 that the US Postmaster General had to announce

1326
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,920
 that the Postal Service would no longer be deciphering codes

1327
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,760
 for people.

1328
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,440
 They said, "No, stop all this bullshit.

1329
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,960
 "We just write the address on like normal people."

1330
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,040
 - But he was so famous that they tended to know

1331
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,880
 to send it to him.

1332
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,300
 - Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

1333
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,600
 - Although I do imagine if that ripping is true,

1334
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,480
 that was he also getting loads of letters

1335
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,440
 that were loving letters of daughters to mothers,

1336
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,880
 which had accidentally got a bit ripped in the post.

1337
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,720
 - Problems.

1338
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,680
 - Must be one for Rob.

1339
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,720
 - And also whenever anyone sent like some flowers

1340
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,640
 saying RIP on them, did he get all those as well?

1341
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,160
 - Yeah, he thought he was much more loved

1342
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,240
 than he actually was.

1343
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,680
 - You say he was a one-man QI.

1344
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,280
 I think he sort of was, James.

1345
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,800
 The life he lived was essentially

1346
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,160
 traveling around the world,

1347
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,360
 but not going to the normal places most of us travel,

1348
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,080
 going to the really weirdo places.

1349
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,400
 So he could come back and talk about the weird shit he'd seen.

1350
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,200
 He went to Norway. - Was that a compliment?

1351
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,560
 'Cause I'm not sure it was.

1352
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,080
 - I think it is.

1353
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,080
 - It kind of felt like a compliment

1354
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,840
 until the word weirdo came in.

1355
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,600
 And then I wasn't sure.

1356
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,920
 - It's a QI compliment.

1357
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,280
 I'm gonna leave you to take it as you see fit.

1358
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,520
 He went to Norway and immediately visited

1359
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,800
 a place called Hel, which is a tiny Norwegian village,

1360
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,840
 just for the sake of coming back

1361
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,280
 and saying he'd been to hell.

1362
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,080
 And he went around finding,

1363
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,720
 I guess people who before the internet existed

1364
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,680
 would have been complete extraordinary people,

1365
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,760
 just people from different cultures,

1366
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,560
 from different tribes, and then reporting on them.

1367
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,480
 And no one believed him.

1368
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,360
 It was like, "QI, every time he announced something,

1369
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,280
 everyone refused to believe him, didn't they?"

1370
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,160
 - He announced some pretty fruity stuff, in my opinion.

1371
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,000
 - Oh yeah.

1372
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,040
 - Yeah, I mean, he claimed things like,

1373
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,920
 "A Frenchman once drank 13 pints of wine in one breath."

1374
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,840
 And you think, "Hmm..."

1375
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,920
 - Did he? - Okay.

1376
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,320
 - Well, believe it or not.

1377
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,680
 - The tragic thing was,

1378
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,040
 the tragic thing about that was

1379
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,400
 that there was a single pit, a great pit,

1380
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,920
 right at the end of the party time.

1381
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,160
 He would have done 40.

1382
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,360
 - Okay, that's it.

1383
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,400
 That is all of our facts.

1384
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,760
