00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:17,00:00:20,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:20,00:00:23,from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:23,00:00:24,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:00:28,00:00:29,and James Harkin.
00:00:29,00:00:31,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:00:31,00:00:34,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:34,00:00:37,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:40,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:40,00:00:44,- My fact is that museums need visitors' breath
00:00:44,00:00:46,in order to preserve their exhibits properly.
00:00:46,00:00:49,- Interesting.
00:00:49,00:00:51,- Museums rely on the moisture from our bodies
00:00:51,00:00:54,to keep their things nice.
00:00:54,00:00:55,"'Cause when you breathe out,"
00:00:55,00:00:57,it's more moist than when you breathe in.
00:00:57,00:00:59,You breathe in normal air and it takes a bit
00:00:59,00:01:02,of your internal juice and it transports it to the outside.
00:01:02,00:01:04,"- Don't say internal juice, that's horrible."
00:01:04,00:01:09,"It's, sorry, Andy, can I just ask with, at the moment"
00:01:09,00:01:12,"with COVID happening, not many people going to museums,"
00:01:12,00:01:15,is there a way that we can donate our internal juice?
00:01:15,00:01:19,"- Yeah, the British Museum is taking donations."
00:01:19,00:01:21,You just say free post British Museum
00:01:21,00:01:23,and you slap that on a big bag of juice.
00:01:26,00:01:28,"And they'll release it among the, yeah."
00:01:28,00:01:31,"So this is according to a curator at the British Museum,"
00:01:31,00:01:34,which has been closed for the longest time in its history.
00:01:34,00:01:38,"And normally they would get about 17,000 visitors a day"
00:01:38,00:01:40,and all those people and their breath
00:01:40,00:01:43,help keep the right level of humidity in the air.
00:01:43,00:01:44,'Cause they've got so many objects
00:01:44,00:01:47,"which require certain levels of humidity,"
00:01:47,00:01:50,things that can dry out easily.
00:01:50,00:01:52,"Maybe the object's made of bone,"
00:01:52,00:01:54,which might crack if it gets too low.
00:01:54,00:01:56,And this is a problem.
00:01:56,00:01:58,Objects have been at risk of cracking out.
00:01:58,00:02:00,"- So when we all are able to return to museums,"
00:02:00,00:02:02,you're suggesting maybe we should go around
00:02:02,00:02:03,spitting on the exhibits?
00:02:03,00:02:06,"- Yes, I am, absolutely."
00:02:06,00:02:09,- We all have a lot of friends who work in museums.
00:02:09,00:02:11,So I thought I'd contact a few of those
00:02:11,00:02:13,to see if they have the same problems in other museums.
00:02:13,00:02:16,So one of our friends is Paolo Viscardi
00:02:16,00:02:18,at the National Museum of Ireland.
00:02:18,00:02:20,And he said that this is spot on.
00:02:20,00:02:23,"Their problem is less with people breathing out so much,"
00:02:23,00:02:26,"but more that when you open the door normally,"
00:02:26,00:02:28,it would bring in a lot of moisture from outside
00:02:28,00:02:30,because it's always pissing it down and doubling.
00:02:30,00:02:32,And so basically you would open the door
00:02:32,00:02:34,and that would bring in moisture from outside
00:02:34,00:02:35,and no one's opening the door at the moment.
00:02:35,00:02:37,So that's a problem.
00:02:37,00:02:41,I also spoke to our friends at the Penis Museum in Iceland
00:02:41,00:02:44,to see if they have any problems with humidity
00:02:44,00:02:48,"at the moment and Thorda wrote back to me and said,"
00:02:48,00:02:50,they've not had problems with conservation
00:02:50,00:02:51,due to lack of humidity.
00:02:52,00:02:55,We have discontinued stuffing our penises
00:02:55,00:02:57,because it led to considerable shrinkage
00:02:57,00:03:01,which may prove problematic when you're in the penis business.
00:03:01,00:03:03,But the few taxidermy specimens we have
00:03:03,00:03:05,"have actually fared a little bit better due to COVID,"
00:03:05,00:03:08,mainly due to the lack of people touching them.
00:03:08,00:03:09,- Right.
00:03:09,00:03:12,- So people aren't touching his penises as much
00:03:12,00:03:14,and so things are a bit better for him under COVID.
00:03:14,00:03:15,- Blessing.
00:03:15,00:03:17,"- And just a reminder for anyone who visits the museum,"
00:03:17,00:03:19,don't spit on them when it's open again.
00:03:19,00:03:20,People are penises alone.
00:03:20,00:03:24,Can I just interject here to say how angry I was
00:03:24,00:03:26,that you chose the one week I was away
00:03:26,00:03:28,to discuss the Icelandic Penis Museum?
00:03:28,00:03:29,"- Oh, sorry."
00:03:29,00:03:31,- I just want to mention that that was quite thoughtless.
00:03:31,00:03:34,"I discovered this week when I was listening back,"
00:03:34,00:03:36,you let Sandy Talks speak about it instead of me.
00:03:36,00:03:38,- I'm really sorry about that.
00:03:38,00:03:40,"When lockdown's over, just come, you can come round"
00:03:40,00:03:42,and we'll get a bottle of wine out.
00:03:42,00:03:44,We can talk about the Icelandic Penis Museum.
00:03:44,00:03:46,"- Honestly, Anna. - James, that means so much to me."
00:03:46,00:03:49,"- Anna, we didn't know you listened to the podcast."
00:03:49,00:03:52,"- We thought you did, we of course."
00:03:52,00:03:53,- I tried to avoid it.
00:03:53,00:03:55,Someone else had it on in the background.
00:03:55,00:03:57,But I don't think you did mention
00:03:57,00:04:00,they've got their only human penis quite recently.
00:04:00,00:04:03,"- Don't turn this into a penis museum, Jack."
00:04:03,00:04:05,- I'm getting it back to the penis museum.
00:04:05,00:04:08,I will make up for that lost time.
00:04:08,00:04:10,"No, I did enjoy a quote from the penis museum"
00:04:10,00:04:13,when I was looking at how they preserved their objects
00:04:13,00:04:16,and they got their first human penis in 2011
00:04:16,00:04:19,"from the 95-year-old, Pally Arison,"
00:04:19,00:04:22,"who promised it, I think, 15 years ago."
00:04:22,00:04:23,I don't think you mentioned this.
00:04:23,00:04:27,"So he promised it 15 years ago to his friend as the curator,"
00:04:27,00:04:30,"lived for an extra 15 years, which possibly wasn't expected."
00:04:30,00:04:33,And there was an interview with the curator
00:04:33,00:04:35,"who was looking down at this 95-year-old man's penis,"
00:04:35,00:04:37,which he now has preserved.
00:04:37,00:04:40,"And the independent reporting on it said,"
00:04:40,00:04:41,"""Glancing down at the glass container,"
00:04:41,00:04:44,"""holding a grayish-brown shriveled mass,"
00:04:44,00:04:47,"""he admitted that the preservation had not been successful."""
00:04:47,00:04:49,(laughing)
00:04:49,00:04:50,"- Oh, dear."
00:04:50,00:04:53,- I remember that story because I think there was a race
00:04:53,00:04:55,to get the first human penis into the penis museum.
00:04:55,00:04:57,And it was between this 95-year-old guy
00:04:57,00:04:59,"and some 27-year-old bloke,"
00:04:59,00:05:01,and whichever of them died first
00:05:01,00:05:03,was going to donate their penis.
00:05:03,00:05:06,"- That is a brilliant plot for a murdered novel, isn't it?"
00:05:06,00:05:07,(laughing)
00:05:07,00:05:09,"- Right, anyway, anyway."
00:05:09,00:05:11,"- Sorry, I've got that out of my system now."
00:05:11,00:05:12,You can go back to proper use.
00:05:12,00:05:15,"Anyway, we'll edit that into the previous episode."
00:05:15,00:05:16,(laughing)
00:05:16,00:05:17,- I'd appreciate that.
00:05:17,00:05:20,"- But it's a big, it's a huge problem,"
00:05:20,00:05:21,and it's not the only problem they have.
00:05:21,00:05:24,"So in June, you remember it was a very hot summer this year,"
00:05:24,00:05:26,the British Museum had to specifically send in a curator
00:05:26,00:05:29,because they thought that Oliver Cromwell's death mask
00:05:29,00:05:31,"might melt because it's made of wax,"
00:05:31,00:05:34,"and it was so hot in the museum that,"
00:05:34,00:05:37,and that obviously is a very rare and precious thing.
00:05:37,00:05:39,"- But so I assume that even during lockdown,"
00:05:39,00:05:41,there were one or two caretakers
00:05:41,00:05:43,"that were able to walk around the museum,"
00:05:43,00:05:46,"because for example, with the problem of no one breathing"
00:05:46,00:05:47,"and creating that humidity,"
00:05:47,00:05:50,"they do have sensors, over 700 all around the museum,"
00:05:50,00:05:53,that go off when the temperatures and humidity
00:05:53,00:05:54,are not at the right level.
00:05:54,00:05:55,So they can adjust them.
00:05:55,00:05:58,They can press buttons to make sure that it regulates.
00:05:58,00:06:02,It's not entirely reliant on humans breathing on them.
00:06:02,00:06:04,So I would have assumed there just would have been someone
00:06:04,00:06:08,there to put a hat on Oliver Cromwell's death mask
00:06:08,00:06:08,or something.
00:06:08,00:06:11,- I think there are people who can do that.
00:06:11,00:06:13,They have a few people who go in.
00:06:13,00:06:16,"There's a brilliant interview with James McClain,"
00:06:16,00:06:18,"who I think Dan definitely knows, I would say."
00:06:18,00:06:19,"I'm not sure if you guys know him,"
00:06:19,00:06:22,who's the fish curator at the Natural History Museum.
00:06:22,00:06:25,And it's been his job during lockdown for some of the time
00:06:25,00:06:26,to go and have a look around
00:06:26,00:06:28,and make sure that everything's okay.
00:06:28,00:06:30,"So he's had to look after the flesh-eating beetles,"
00:06:30,00:06:32,for instance.
00:06:32,00:06:33,"So they have these beetles there,"
00:06:33,00:06:34,which strip down the bones.
00:06:34,00:06:36,"Whenever you get a new little animal,"
00:06:36,00:06:38,you put it in and the beetles eat all the meat off it
00:06:38,00:06:40,and you come out with a perfect bone.
00:06:40,00:06:42,And he's had to feed them so that they don't go looking
00:06:42,00:06:44,for other things to eat.
00:06:44,00:06:46,So he has to give them some conger eel heads
00:06:46,00:06:47,to keep them happy.
00:06:47,00:06:48,- Oh my God.
00:06:48,00:06:49,- And he said something else in this.
00:06:49,00:06:50,"This is not about conservation,"
00:06:50,00:06:52,but I thought it was really interesting.
00:06:52,00:06:55,He says he monitors the alcohol supply system
00:06:55,00:06:57,in the Natural History Museum.
00:06:57,00:06:59,"And apparently in the Natural History Museum,"
00:06:59,00:07:03,there is a series of pipes that go through the whole museum.
00:07:03,00:07:05,Like they're powered by steam power
00:07:05,00:07:07,and they fire alcohol through the whole museum.
00:07:07,00:07:09,And there are little taps in all the rooms
00:07:09,00:07:12,where you can just get little bits of pure alcohol
00:07:12,00:07:15,if you need it for preservation.
00:07:15,00:07:16,Isn't that amazing?
00:07:16,00:07:17,- That is so cool.
00:07:17,00:07:18,- It's so cool.
00:07:18,00:07:19,- Can you drink that?
00:07:19,00:07:20,Or is that too intense?
00:07:20,00:07:21,"- No, it's pure ethanol."
00:07:21,00:07:23,So I would advise against it.
00:07:23,00:07:26,"If you ever get stuck in the Natural History Museum,"
00:07:26,00:07:29,"then probably, you know, there might be--"
00:07:29,00:07:30,- Don't check the tap.
00:07:30,00:07:31,- Don't check the tap.
00:07:31,00:07:33,Go to check out the staff canteen
00:07:33,00:07:37,"if you need some alcohol, probably, rather than the taps."
00:07:37,00:07:38,"Otherwise, you've drunk from an ethanol tap,"
00:07:38,00:07:39,you're absolutely hammered
00:07:39,00:07:42,"and you're in a room surrounded by dead,"
00:07:42,00:07:44,"stuffed, giant, extinct animals,"
00:07:44,00:07:46,which sounds like something out of a nightmare.
00:07:46,00:07:48,"- That movie, ""The Nice at the Museum"""
00:07:48,00:07:50,is very different if you've been drinking pure ethanol
00:07:50,00:07:51,the night before.
00:07:51,00:07:55,- It's quite dangerous having all that ethanol there
00:07:55,00:07:58,for preservation in the Natural History Museum.
00:07:58,00:08:00,They have to be careful with bigger animals.
00:08:00,00:08:03,"So I think the head of fish curation,"
00:08:03,00:08:04,"who's called Oliver Crimin,"
00:08:04,00:08:05,"or he claims to be the head,"
00:08:05,00:08:07,but maybe your friend is his rival.
00:08:07,00:08:08,- They work together.
00:08:08,00:08:10,"Ollie and James work together, yeah."
00:08:10,00:08:11,"- Okay, work together, rivals,"
00:08:11,00:08:12,whatever you wanna call it.
00:08:12,00:08:14,(laughing)
00:08:14,00:08:18,They stuffed their largest fish recently.
00:08:18,00:08:21,"So they've got 900,000 dead fish in there"
00:08:21,00:08:23,"and it was a blue marlin, which was four meters long."
00:08:23,00:08:26,It washed up in Wales in 2016.
00:08:26,00:08:28,"And I just love the fact that within 24 hours,"
00:08:28,00:08:30,"Oliver's there on the beach,"
00:08:30,00:08:32,on the Pembrokeshire coast immediately.
00:08:32,00:08:37,"And it needed 10,000 litres of ethanol,"
00:08:37,00:08:38,"which is what you'd normally preserve it in,"
00:08:38,00:08:41,but that's incredibly flammable and very dangerous.
00:08:41,00:08:45,That would explode the entire museum if a flame got to it.
00:08:45,00:08:48,"So they had to sort of create this new solution for it,"
00:08:48,00:08:49,glycerol.
00:08:49,00:08:51,"But it's very cool. - 10,000 litres."
00:08:51,00:08:52,"- Yeah, it's big."
00:08:52,00:08:54,- How big is a marlin?
00:08:54,00:08:57,- They're much bigger than I realised.
00:08:57,00:08:59,"They-- - It's like a size of a tuna,"
00:08:59,00:09:00,"isn't it, a marlin?"
00:09:00,00:09:01,"- Yeah, marlins are massive."
00:09:01,00:09:04,"- I guess, just that's amazing."
00:09:04,00:09:05,That is really extraordinary.
00:09:05,00:09:07,"Is one of them, does one of them do the heads of the fish"
00:09:07,00:09:09,and the other one does the tails of the fish?
00:09:09,00:09:11,"- Yeah, but they flip for it on the start of each day"
00:09:11,00:09:12,to see what does it do.
00:09:12,00:09:14,(laughing)
00:09:14,00:09:17,- Just back to the British Museum very quickly.
00:09:17,00:09:19,What do you suppose the two most popular things
00:09:19,00:09:22,"in the museum, what do you think the two most popular things"
00:09:22,00:09:23,are? - Okay.
00:09:23,00:09:25,- And I'm getting this from a British Museum blog
00:09:25,00:09:28,"from 2017, so it might have changed since then."
00:09:28,00:09:31,"- Like the mummies, I would say people always go"
00:09:31,00:09:32,"for the mummies, don't they?"
00:09:32,00:09:33,- I'd say one of the mummies.
00:09:33,00:09:35,"- Boom, number one, Egyptian collection mummies"
00:09:35,00:09:38,is the number one most searched for thing
00:09:38,00:09:40,on their website that people wanna find out about.
00:09:40,00:09:41,So what's number two?
00:09:41,00:09:44,"- For number two, I would say maybe the--"
00:09:44,00:09:45,"- Is that a stone, is that in there?"
00:09:45,00:09:46,"- Yeah. - Oh, there is a stone, is there?"
00:09:46,00:09:48,- I would say the-- - I'd say the Fiji mermaid.
00:09:48,00:09:50,"- Oh, is that the-- - Is that the Elgin marbles?"
00:09:50,00:09:52,"- Oh, the Elgin marbles, yeah, good cool."
00:09:52,00:09:57,"It's actually Japanese erotica, so shunger it's called"
00:09:57,00:09:59,and these are on panels.
00:09:59,00:10:01,It's a painting of very erotic Japanese
00:10:01,00:10:04,kind of karma sutra-esque looking drawings
00:10:04,00:10:06,"and there was a big exhibition in 2014,"
00:10:06,00:10:09,"the second most searched for thing on their website,"
00:10:09,00:10:11,"more so than the opening hours,"
00:10:11,00:10:13,it's called Japanese erotica.
00:10:13,00:10:14,- No way.
00:10:14,00:10:17,- It's no good knowing the opening hours
00:10:17,00:10:20,if you don't know the way to the Japanese erotica.
00:10:20,00:10:24,"- That's what you constantly see,"
00:10:24,00:10:26,very disappointed looking slightly horny people
00:10:26,00:10:27,"at two in the morning,"
00:10:27,00:10:30,looking really angry outside the British Museum.
00:10:30,00:10:32,Didn't realize they weren't open.
00:10:32,00:10:36,"- Yeah, 40,000 annual searches for shunger on their website"
00:10:36,00:10:39,"and the Egyptian collection gets 53,000."
00:10:39,00:10:41,"- Do we know if that's 40,000 different people"
00:10:41,00:10:44,or is it one unbelievably horny?
00:10:44,00:10:49,"One cool thing during this whole breath thing,"
00:10:49,00:10:50,"one of the collections of,"
00:10:50,00:10:54,the head of collections care is a woman called Sandra Smith
00:10:54,00:10:56,"and she said about the breath crisis at the museum,"
00:10:56,00:11:00,"she said, ""It was not alarming, that's a bit scaremongering,"
00:11:00,00:11:01,"""but it's fair to say that when we started"
00:11:01,00:11:03,"""watching the moisture dropping,"
00:11:03,00:11:04,"""we were all holding our breath"
00:11:04,00:11:05,"""and wanting it to normalize."""
00:11:05,00:11:07,(laughing)
00:11:07,00:11:09,"- What, stop it, you idiot."
00:11:09,00:11:12,(upbeat music)
00:11:12,00:11:20,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna."
00:11:20,00:11:23,"- Okay, well, before I say my fact this week,"
00:11:23,00:11:26,I just want to warn any more squeamish listeners
00:11:26,00:11:28,"that it is kind of gruesome,"
00:11:28,00:11:32,but I want to reassure them that it has a happy ending.
00:11:32,00:11:34,"So, steal yourselves."
00:11:34,00:11:36,"- My fact this week is that in 1997,"
00:11:36,00:11:40,a mass tug of war went so badly wrong
00:11:40,00:11:43,that it ripped two of the contestants' arms off.
00:11:43,00:11:44,"- Anna, no."
00:11:44,00:11:48,"- I'm sorry, all of your guys' faces"
00:11:48,00:11:49,are making me regret this.
00:11:49,00:11:51,"- We knew what you were gonna say, Anna."
00:11:51,00:11:53,"- Exactly, it doesn't make it any better."
00:11:54,00:11:56,"- As I hear it, it gets worse, actually."
00:11:56,00:11:58,"I'm just gonna say immediately,"
00:11:58,00:12:00,"before I go anywhere near the rest of this,"
00:12:00,00:12:03,that they had some very extensive microsurgery
00:12:03,00:12:05,and their arms were reattached
00:12:05,00:12:07,along with extensive nerve grafting
00:12:07,00:12:09,"and they regained their hand functions, okay?"
00:12:09,00:12:12,"So, we're okay to talk about this,"
00:12:12,00:12:15,a tug of war ripped their arms off.
00:12:15,00:12:17,And that can happen.
00:12:17,00:12:19,It was actually meant to be a day of celebration.
00:12:19,00:12:21,It was in Taiwan and it was the anniversary
00:12:21,00:12:22,of the end of Japanese rule.
00:12:22,00:12:24,It was to celebrate that.
00:12:24,00:12:27,And 1600 people took part
00:12:27,00:12:31,and people don't realize how dangerous tug of war is.
00:12:31,00:12:34,"So, that ended up putting 80,000 kilograms of force"
00:12:34,00:12:37,on this five centimeter wide nylon rope
00:12:37,00:12:39,"that could only bear 26,000."
00:12:39,00:12:42,"So, it was kind of impressive that it hung on that long."
00:12:42,00:12:47,And the rope snapped and the rebound force of it snapping
00:12:47,00:12:49,seems to have just torn off the left arms
00:12:49,00:12:52,of the two people at the front of each row.
00:12:52,00:12:55,"So, it's kind of amazing physics, I guess."
00:12:55,00:12:57,That massive force is sitting in the rope
00:12:57,00:12:59,when it's being pulled.
00:12:59,00:13:00,"And as soon as the rope breaks,"
00:13:00,00:13:02,"that force has to go somewhere,"
00:13:02,00:13:03,that energy goes somewhere.
00:13:03,00:13:06,"And so, it immediately goes straight into the body"
00:13:06,00:13:08,of the person who's at the front of the row
00:13:08,00:13:10,who essentially pulls his body away from his arm.
00:13:10,00:13:12,- I'm so squeamish that I actually didn't do
00:13:12,00:13:14,any further research on this specific incident
00:13:14,00:13:15,that happened.
00:13:15,00:13:17,"And so, I assumed that it was just that they got tugged"
00:13:17,00:13:21,"at the wrong moment or that like the other 3,000 people"
00:13:21,00:13:22,on the other team all pulled at the same time
00:13:22,00:13:25,and only one person had turned up for their own tea
00:13:25,00:13:26,or whatever.
00:13:26,00:13:29,(laughing)
00:13:29,00:13:30,- It was not that.
00:13:30,00:13:32,- It was interesting 'cause it was a slightly different
00:13:32,00:13:35,"to the normal tug of war, I think, that we have"
00:13:35,00:13:38,in that there were lots of branches that came off the rope.
00:13:38,00:13:41,"So, it wasn't just like, let's say it was 16,000 people."
00:13:41,00:13:44,"It wasn't 8,000 people pulling on one end of the rope"
00:13:44,00:13:46,"and 8,000 people on the other."
00:13:46,00:13:49,All the rope had loads of kind of bits coming off it
00:13:49,00:13:51,that people would pull on the side.
00:13:51,00:13:53,'Cause that's the way they do it in Taiwan.
00:13:53,00:13:55,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:13:55,00:13:56,"Depending on your level of squeamishness,"
00:13:56,00:14:00,there is a really good Snopes article on it.
00:14:00,00:14:02,The picture in which I found extremely confusing.
00:14:02,00:14:05,"So, it does show a man lying on the ground"
00:14:05,00:14:09,after the tug of war next to his arm.
00:14:09,00:14:14,And then the only other person in shot is a cameraman
00:14:14,00:14:16,"who's sitting there with his back to this man,"
00:14:16,00:14:18,pointing the camera in a completely different direction.
00:14:18,00:14:20,"Now, what I wanna know is, what in God's name"
00:14:20,00:14:22,is he taking a photo of?
00:14:22,00:14:24,That is more interesting than that.
00:14:24,00:14:26,"- Oh, man."
00:14:26,00:14:27,"Well, there were two guys, right?"
00:14:27,00:14:28,Maybe it's the other guy.
00:14:28,00:14:29,- There were two guys on the arm.
00:14:29,00:14:32,"Imagine coming around after extensive microsurgery,"
00:14:32,00:14:33,"hearing the surgeon saying, don't worry,"
00:14:33,00:14:36,we have brilliant medical science these days.
00:14:36,00:14:37,We've managed to reattach your arm.
00:14:37,00:14:39,"You look down and you think, that's not my watch."
00:14:39,00:14:43,"- This happens a lot, right?"
00:14:43,00:14:46,And not enough that it's a sort of public announcement
00:14:46,00:14:47,"to say, stop doing tug of war."
00:14:47,00:14:49,But this isn't a one-off.
00:14:49,00:14:50,There are cases that you can read.
00:14:50,00:14:51,- Don't say one-off.
00:14:51,00:14:53,(all laughing)
00:14:53,00:14:57,"- But sadly, in these mass tug of wars,"
00:14:57,00:14:58,people do lose hands.
00:14:58,00:15:00,"In some cases, sadly, some people have died."
00:15:00,00:15:04,"But it's only with these mega, these mega tug of wars."
00:15:04,00:15:06,- I think one of the problems is that
00:15:06,00:15:10,"in professional tug of war, they have rules, right?"
00:15:10,00:15:12,They have very strict rules of what you're allowed to do
00:15:12,00:15:13,and what you're not allowed to do.
00:15:13,00:15:15,"If you just get a load of people,"
00:15:15,00:15:18,"like 1600 people pulling on a bit of rope,"
00:15:18,00:15:20,they're not gonna necessarily follow
00:15:20,00:15:22,all the health and safety things.
00:15:22,00:15:25,The main problem is when you wrap it around yourself
00:15:25,00:15:27,to kind of pull.
00:15:27,00:15:29,And that's obviously a problem.
00:15:29,00:15:30,"In a professional tug of war,"
00:15:30,00:15:32,you're not allowed to do that at all.
00:15:32,00:15:35,- It's amazing how widespread tug of war seems to have been
00:15:35,00:15:38,"throughout history and all around the world, isn't it?"
00:15:38,00:15:43,"So in Thailand, it happens at Buddhist funerals,"
00:15:43,00:15:45,"I think, in Thailand and Burma."
00:15:45,00:15:47,"And it's only if you're a really high up Buddhist,"
00:15:47,00:15:49,"if you're a really senior monk,"
00:15:49,00:15:52,then there's a massive tug of war over your corpse.
00:15:52,00:15:54,- Not over your actual corpse.
00:15:54,00:15:58,"- Okay, well, it's over your hearse with the corpse on it."
00:15:58,00:16:02,"And this is, it sounds kind of fun."
00:16:02,00:16:05,Your body's put on a cart and it's pulled to this field
00:16:05,00:16:06,and it's gonna be cremated.
00:16:06,00:16:09,"But first of all, all the villagers gather around"
00:16:09,00:16:11,and they pull at the cart on either side.
00:16:11,00:16:13,Sometimes this goes on for days
00:16:13,00:16:15,of just pulling the cart one way
00:16:15,00:16:16,and then the rope snaps
00:16:16,00:16:18,and the other team pull it a long way the other way.
00:16:18,00:16:21,And they get cheerleaders and they have megaphones
00:16:21,00:16:23,with people kind of egging one team on.
00:16:23,00:16:26,And with just with this Buddhist monk's body
00:16:26,00:16:29,rollicking around on the cart for a while.
00:16:29,00:16:30,- Wow.
00:16:30,00:16:31,- And I think the idea is that it's a way
00:16:31,00:16:34,"of getting all the goodness out of the monk,"
00:16:34,00:16:38,all the merit they call it before you cremate him.
00:16:38,00:16:40,And it sounds like an absolute laugh.
00:16:40,00:16:42,(all laughing)
00:16:42,00:16:44,- I was reading about professional tug of war
00:16:44,00:16:47,and the world championships and stuff like that.
00:16:47,00:16:51,And the best women's team is from Taiwan.
00:16:51,00:16:54,They are unbelievably good.
00:16:54,00:16:57,They've won every single world championship to date.
00:16:57,00:16:58,"- Right, wow."
00:16:58,00:17:00,- But they go under the name of Chinese Taipei
00:17:00,00:17:02,because obviously there's political things
00:17:02,00:17:05,between China and the Taiwanese.
00:17:05,00:17:07,And so they compete under the name Chinese Taipei.
00:17:07,00:17:09,"But whenever they play China,"
00:17:09,00:17:12,"they always want to absolutely smash them, okay?"
00:17:12,00:17:15,I read an interview with one of the players
00:17:15,00:17:17,called Chen Lihui.
00:17:17,00:17:21,"And she said that when she played against the Chinese,"
00:17:21,00:17:23,"they could have beaten them really, really quickly."
00:17:23,00:17:25,"And she says, ""But instead we tortured them slowly"
00:17:25,00:17:28,"before making them lose."""
00:17:28,00:17:30,So they just kind of make it look like
00:17:30,00:17:31,"they're gonna win, look like they're gonna win,"
00:17:31,00:17:32,look like they're gonna win.
00:17:32,00:17:33,And then they smashed them.
00:17:33,00:17:34,"- Oh, my goodness."
00:17:34,00:17:35,- That's amazing.
00:17:35,00:17:39,"- Yeah, I watched a professional tug of war match"
00:17:39,00:17:41,just this morning and it was very different
00:17:41,00:17:43,to how I pictured it would be.
00:17:43,00:17:47,"As in I thought you would have the gun or whatever go, go off."
00:17:47,00:17:50,"And it would be kind of just kind of a lot of pulling,"
00:17:50,00:17:54,"a lot of just, come on, let's do this, a lot of tugging."
00:17:54,00:17:56,But what happens in the one that I saw
00:17:56,00:18:00,"and this was a finals and it was, I think it was England"
00:18:00,00:18:02,"and someone else, they basically, they started it"
00:18:02,00:18:04,and they go completely rigid.
00:18:04,00:18:07,"They put their feet in, they lock down and they hold"
00:18:07,00:18:09,"and they're pulling really hard,"
00:18:09,00:18:10,but there's no movement whatsoever.
00:18:10,00:18:12,And this match lasted nine minutes long
00:18:12,00:18:14,"and for the first five or so minutes,"
00:18:14,00:18:16,it was just them basically holding firm.
00:18:16,00:18:20,I think with a tension that I guess it just tires you out
00:18:20,00:18:21,a bit and then you make your move.
00:18:21,00:18:24,"So it's a sort of, but it's very boring"
00:18:24,00:18:25,for the first five minutes.
00:18:25,00:18:27,You're just staring at people leaning backwards.
00:18:27,00:18:29,"- I read, it's not a good spectator score."
00:18:29,00:18:31,"Yeah, it's just motionless, motionless, motionless."
00:18:31,00:18:33,"Oh, a load of people have fallen over the end."
00:18:35,00:18:38,I read one article and this was in the physics website.
00:18:38,00:18:41,"So they weren't going on the sporting side of it,"
00:18:41,00:18:44,but they reckoned that it's just basically about friction.
00:18:44,00:18:46,It's not even about how strong you are.
00:18:46,00:18:49,"Because if you think about it, if you're pulling on a rope"
00:18:49,00:18:51,"which is attached to a wall, you can pull it"
00:18:51,00:18:52,as hard as you want.
00:18:52,00:18:54,"And if you pull and pull and pull, all you're gonna do"
00:18:54,00:18:56,is move yourself closer to the wall.
00:18:56,00:18:57,You're not gonna move the wall
00:18:57,00:18:58,because the wall is stuck there.
00:18:58,00:19:01,And so the idea is that if the other team
00:19:01,00:19:03,has got a really good face and really stuck
00:19:03,00:19:06,on the floor with good friction with nice solid boots
00:19:06,00:19:09,"and you're on ice, you could be a million times"
00:19:09,00:19:10,"stronger than them, but all you're gonna do"
00:19:10,00:19:11,is pull yourself closer to them.
00:19:11,00:19:13,You're not gonna pull them closer to you.
00:19:13,00:19:17,- So I read a lot of the Tug of War International
00:19:17,00:19:19,Federation Rulebook in preparation for this recording.
00:19:19,00:19:22,"Oh my God, they're called TWIFT for short."
00:19:22,00:19:24,And their rules are so good.
00:19:24,00:19:26,They're so interesting.
00:19:26,00:19:27,So there are all kinds of rules.
00:19:27,00:19:29,There's a whole page about doping in Tug of War.
00:19:29,00:19:30,Not allowed.
00:19:30,00:19:32,"And there's not much anyway, 'cause why would you?"
00:19:32,00:19:33,- But the rules about shoes--
00:19:33,00:19:35,"- What? 'Cause it makes you stronger, Charlie."
00:19:35,00:19:37,"- Well, but it doesn't give you more friction."
00:19:37,00:19:38,"It doesn't, you know. - Oh, you can't take--"
00:19:38,00:19:40,- You can't take a drug that makes you rough.
00:19:40,00:19:42,Yeah. (laughing)
00:19:42,00:19:43,- It would need to be a stickiness.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"You want sticky feet, don't you?"
00:19:44,00:19:48,"- Well, this is exactly, this is why the shoes section"
00:19:48,00:19:51,of TWIFT rules is so enormous and comprehensive.
00:19:51,00:19:53,You aren't allowed to have shoes
00:19:53,00:19:55,that are more than 20% longer than your feet.
00:19:55,00:19:57,"Because when you think about it, that is--"
00:19:57,00:20:00,- That's why the clouds won the first five Olympics
00:20:00,00:20:02,didn't they? (laughing)
00:20:02,00:20:03,"- They would win, wouldn't they?"
00:20:03,00:20:05,Because they've just got so much more surface
00:20:05,00:20:06,in contact with the ground.
00:20:06,00:20:07,"Like, what?"
00:20:07,00:20:09,And there are all these things you could be banned for.
00:20:09,00:20:11,You could be banned for sitting down.
00:20:11,00:20:13,"That's happened in, when it was an Olympic sport,"
00:20:13,00:20:15,"actually, the British team ones got banned for sitting."
00:20:15,00:20:16,It's not really sitting down.
00:20:16,00:20:17,"It's falling over. - Well, actually,"
00:20:17,00:20:21,"the first ever rules, I read them and explicitly,"
00:20:21,00:20:23,it says sitting on another member of your team
00:20:23,00:20:26,is not permitted. (laughing)
00:20:26,00:20:27,"- Fair, that is fair."
00:20:28,00:20:30,- But also not trying hard enough
00:20:30,00:20:31,is a disqualifiable offense.
00:20:31,00:20:32,- Really?
00:20:32,00:20:34,"- So it says in the rules,"
00:20:34,00:20:37,teams failing to actively engage in the competitive effort
00:20:37,00:20:39,during a pull leading to a prolonged stalemate
00:20:39,00:20:42,which could bring the sport into disrepute.
00:20:42,00:20:44,"- But that's what I was saying, basically,"
00:20:44,00:20:48,what the Chinese Taipei/Taiwanese team were doing.
00:20:48,00:20:51,"Like, deliberately not trying hard to try and make it."
00:20:51,00:20:53,"- Well, they gotta watch out then, yeah."
00:20:53,00:20:54,- That's very interesting.
00:20:54,00:20:56,"TWIFT is a wonderful website, by the way."
00:20:58,00:20:59,- I read the latest newsletter.
00:20:59,00:21:02,They've just celebrated their 60th anniversary
00:21:02,00:21:05,as the Tug of War International Federation.
00:21:05,00:21:07,"Sadly, due to COVID, aren't able to meet up"
00:21:07,00:21:09,to be there with each other.
00:21:09,00:21:10,So they're gonna do it next year.
00:21:10,00:21:11,- It's the perfect sport.
00:21:11,00:21:12,It's the perfect sport
00:21:12,00:21:14,for keeping people at fixed two-meter intervals.
00:21:14,00:21:16,(laughing)
00:21:16,00:21:21,"- Yeah, so they're gonna be meeting up next year"
00:21:21,00:21:25,for their 60th plus one anniversary in 2021.
00:21:25,00:21:27,And I was reading their mission statement
00:21:27,00:21:30,"and the mission statement basically is,"
00:21:30,00:21:32,their main objective is they want this
00:21:32,00:21:33,to become an Olympic sport again.
00:21:33,00:21:35,They're desperate to get it back in the Olympics
00:21:35,00:21:37,"'cause in the early Olympics,"
00:21:37,00:21:39,"they were five Olympics that they were a part of,"
00:21:39,00:21:40,"I think, was it?"
00:21:40,00:21:44,"1920, I think, was the last that they ever did."
00:21:44,00:21:48,"And Britain, the holders of the,"
00:21:48,00:21:49,"well, not necessarily Britain, the holders,"
00:21:49,00:21:51,because it's actually a very specific bit of Britain.
00:21:51,00:21:54,It is the city of London police
00:21:55,00:21:57,who are the reigning Olympic champions of tug of war.
00:21:57,00:22:00,"And yeah, and they're constantly trying"
00:22:00,00:22:01,"to get it back into the Olympics,"
00:22:01,00:22:02,but it's not happened yet.
00:22:02,00:22:04,And I think it should go back in.
00:22:04,00:22:05,It's no different to the discus.
00:22:05,00:22:07,"It's no different to, yeah, I think it's quite a..."
00:22:07,00:22:09,"- Yeah, but it's no different to egg and spoon race"
00:22:09,00:22:11,"or that race where you run across,"
00:22:11,00:22:14,put a different item of clothing on each time
00:22:14,00:22:15,until you look like a farmer.
00:22:15,00:22:17,That's not the answer.
00:22:17,00:22:19,"- It requires much, much less skill than those."
00:22:19,00:22:22,It requires being fat and having spikes in your shoes.
00:22:22,00:22:23,"- No, no, no, no."
00:22:23,00:22:26,"It is, it's not just about strength, as we know."
00:22:26,00:22:28,It's skill as well.
00:22:28,00:22:29,"- No, that's what I'm saying."
00:22:29,00:22:31,"It's not about, it's nothing to do with strength."
00:22:31,00:22:34,It's about standing there and being heavy.
00:22:34,00:22:38,- Heavy is nothing to do with it.
00:22:38,00:22:39,- I found it really interesting
00:22:39,00:22:40,"that we've got two people,"
00:22:40,00:22:43,me and Anna on the side of tug of war is not a skill spot.
00:22:43,00:22:45,And then we've got you two on the other side
00:22:45,00:22:47,pulling in your direction.
00:22:47,00:22:50,- Only one way to settle it.
00:22:52,00:22:53,- I am pro of the Olympic claim
00:22:53,00:22:56,because Great Britain did seem to absolutely smash it.
00:22:56,00:22:58,"'Cause not only did the police team win,"
00:22:58,00:23:01,we were allowed to submit various teams.
00:23:01,00:23:04,"And I think Great Britain won all three medals in 1908,"
00:23:04,00:23:06,as well as winning various medals in the race.
00:23:06,00:23:07,- But it wasn't just Great Britain
00:23:07,00:23:08,winning all three medals.
00:23:08,00:23:12,It was specific police forces from Britain winning all three.
00:23:12,00:23:14,"So the city of London took gold,"
00:23:14,00:23:16,"Liverpool's police force won silver,"
00:23:16,00:23:20,and then more other London policemen took the bronze medal.
00:23:20,00:23:22,It could not have been a more decent thing.
00:23:22,00:23:23,"- It was quite controversial though,"
00:23:23,00:23:24,"because the Liverpool team,"
00:23:24,00:23:27,there is a suggestion that they were wearing
00:23:27,00:23:29,such enormous shoes.
00:23:29,00:23:32,"And according to some people who wrote about it at the time,"
00:23:32,00:23:33,their shoes were so heavy
00:23:33,00:23:36,that they could only just lift their feet off the floor
00:23:36,00:23:40,after they had to leave the arena.
00:23:40,00:23:42,"- Well, so if you read the latest newsletter"
00:23:42,00:23:44,"from the TWIFT website,"
00:23:44,00:23:47,there's an actual breakdown
00:23:47,00:23:49,of how a lot of these problems were solved
00:23:49,00:23:51,"by one of the founding members who helped us solve it,"
00:23:51,00:23:54,"which is when they had their first international matches,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,every different country had different rules
00:23:56,00:23:57,"for what they were allowed to do,"
00:23:57,00:23:59,"different size shoes, different grips,"
00:23:59,00:24:00,different laying down on stuff.
00:24:00,00:24:03,And so it was this guy who writes his historical piece
00:24:03,00:24:04,"in the newsletter,"
00:24:04,00:24:07,who says that he got together with everyone
00:24:07,00:24:10,"and they sort of internationalized the rules for tug of war,"
00:24:10,00:24:13,so that there's now one solid way
00:24:13,00:24:15,"that if you enter this competition,"
00:24:15,00:24:17,you can only perform it.
00:24:17,00:24:19,- I really hope that the TWIFT website
00:24:19,00:24:21,gets a massive spike in visitors.
00:24:21,00:24:22,"If you're listening to this,"
00:24:22,00:24:24,just please go to the TWIFT website
00:24:24,00:24:26,'cause I want whoever runs the TWIFT website
00:24:26,00:24:29,"to say, like, phone his colleagues,"
00:24:29,00:24:32,"it's finally happening, we're doing it."
00:24:32,00:24:34,- TWIFT just sounds like a swear word you use
00:24:34,00:24:35,when you've got a toddler around
00:24:35,00:24:37,"so you can't say the actual word, doesn't it?"
00:24:37,00:24:39,It's an absolute TWIFT.
00:24:39,00:24:41,I think that there should just be the prerequisite
00:24:41,00:24:44,that if you cannot mount the podiums to claim your medal
00:24:44,00:24:46,"'cause your shoes are too heavy,"
00:24:46,00:24:48,that's automatic disqualification.
00:24:48,00:24:50,"- I'll just chuck it down here, that's fine."
00:24:50,00:24:55,- Imagine the very start of the Olympics
00:24:55,00:24:56,where they're all marching around the stadium
00:24:56,00:24:59,with a big flag and you've just got the tug of war
00:24:59,00:25:01,so you're dragging their feet along.
00:25:01,00:25:05,"Here they come, the tug of war competitors."
00:25:05,00:25:08,It always slows down for this bit.
00:25:14,00:25:18,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James."
00:25:18,00:25:21,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in medieval elections,"
00:25:21,00:25:24,you were supposed to object to any suggestion
00:25:24,00:25:25,that you wanted to win.
00:25:25,00:25:29,"When he became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1093,"
00:25:29,00:25:32,St. Anselm refused to accept the ceremonial staff
00:25:32,00:25:37,so they had to break his fingers to force it into his hand.
00:25:37,00:25:37,- Come on.
00:25:37,00:25:42,"- This is, and if you go on Snopes,"
00:25:42,00:25:45,you can see photographs of the hand being broken.
00:25:45,00:25:47,"- No, obviously not."
00:25:47,00:25:49,- There's a scribe looking at something else.
00:25:49,00:25:50,What is he looking at?
00:25:50,00:25:57,- So I read this from BBC History Magazine.
00:25:57,00:25:59,It's an article by Professor Bjorn Weiler
00:25:59,00:26:01,from Aberystwyth University
00:26:01,00:26:02,and it's about medieval elections
00:26:02,00:26:04,that took place around that time.
00:26:04,00:26:08,And there were always elections for things like bishops
00:26:08,00:26:11,and archbishops and popes and councils and stuff like that.
00:26:11,00:26:13,"Sometimes also kings, some kings were elected,"
00:26:13,00:26:14,which I didn't know.
00:26:14,00:26:17,But the idea was that whoever won
00:26:17,00:26:19,was gonna be whatever God wanted.
00:26:19,00:26:22,And you shouldn't really want to have power over other people
00:26:22,00:26:24,if you're a holy good person.
00:26:24,00:26:27,And so you wouldn't try and go around
00:26:27,00:26:29,getting people to vote for you or anything like that.
00:26:29,00:26:31,"It was really, really looked down on."
00:26:31,00:26:34,"You should just accept the nomination, accept the win"
00:26:34,00:26:36,"and say, well, I didn't really want this,"
00:26:36,00:26:39,"but since you insist, I'm gonna do it."
00:26:39,00:26:43,"And then Saint Anselm, he got the archbishopship of Canterbury"
00:26:43,00:26:46,"and they had to give him the staff as part of the ceremony,"
00:26:46,00:26:48,"but he was like, no, I'm still gonna pretend"
00:26:48,00:26:50,that I don't want this.
00:26:50,00:26:51,And they had to break it.
00:26:51,00:26:53,- You'll have to force that ceremonial staff
00:26:53,00:26:54,into my dead hands.
00:26:54,00:26:59,"- Oh, so he was definitely acting?"
00:26:59,00:27:01,"- Well, actually probably not, 'cause he was a saint."
00:27:01,00:27:04,"And if you believe all the stories about Saint Anselm,"
00:27:04,00:27:08,he was an extremely pious man who didn't want any...
00:27:08,00:27:10,It's funny 'cause he's quite a famous saint
00:27:10,00:27:13,"and he did lots of cool stuff, but all the way through,"
00:27:13,00:27:15,"it's like, oh, no, I don't really want anyone"
00:27:15,00:27:17,"to know who I am, oh, no."
00:27:17,00:27:20,Like he deliberately went to become the number two
00:27:20,00:27:23,"of a very famous monk, because the other guy was so famous,"
00:27:23,00:27:25,he thought that will deflect all the fame off me.
00:27:25,00:27:27,- He's like the two fish curators
00:27:27,00:27:29,at the Natural History Museum is what we're saying.
00:27:29,00:27:32,(all laughing)
00:27:32,00:27:34,"I love, it's such a funny, although he wouldn't have been"
00:27:34,00:27:35,"a saint at the time, I guess."
00:27:35,00:27:37,He would have just been Mr. Anselm.
00:27:37,00:27:40,"- So, yeah, probably not Mr. Anselm."
00:27:40,00:27:42,"- Yeah, Mr. Anselm."
00:27:42,00:27:44,"- We should just say, he obviously set an example"
00:27:44,00:27:47,that a lot of world leaders follow today
00:27:47,00:27:49,in his reluctance for power.
00:27:49,00:27:54,"I like Anselm because he's the father of scholasticism,"
00:27:54,00:27:56,"so which was a massive deal,"
00:27:56,00:27:58,which was basically the biggest intellectual movement
00:27:58,00:27:59,of the late middle ages.
00:27:59,00:28:01,"Stop laughing, Andy, that's not why I like him."
00:28:01,00:28:04,(all laughing)
00:28:04,00:28:07,"- I'm not an absolute no, okay?"
00:28:07,00:28:10,"So, scholasticism was this very important new wave thing,"
00:28:10,00:28:13,which was using logic and reason and debate
00:28:13,00:28:14,to justify religious arguments
00:28:14,00:28:15,instead of just monasticism
00:28:15,00:28:17,where you bought everything you read in the Bible
00:28:17,00:28:18,without questioning it.
00:28:18,00:28:20,"Anyway, the reason I raise it is"
00:28:20,00:28:22,'cause the most famous scholastic
00:28:22,00:28:24,"is one of my favorite people, who's Peter Abelard,"
00:28:24,00:28:26,"who was the guy who was inspired by Anselm,"
00:28:26,00:28:30,"and he was the leading philosopher of the 12th century,"
00:28:30,00:28:32,"really arrogant, bit of a pain,"
00:28:32,00:28:34,"argued with his teachers all the time,"
00:28:34,00:28:36,totally uninterested in women
00:28:36,00:28:38,"'cause all about his study,"
00:28:38,00:28:40,and then suddenly decided he really wanted
00:28:40,00:28:42,to be the best juicer on the face of the earth.
00:28:42,00:28:45,"So, fell in love with this woman called Eloise,"
00:28:45,00:28:48,and shagged her in the convent kitchen
00:28:48,00:28:52,"and in her uncle's bedroom, and then he married her,"
00:28:52,00:28:55,"but he also wanted to get a religious post,"
00:28:55,00:28:58,"so he married her in secret,"
00:28:58,00:29:02,and her uncle thought that he'd refused to marry her.
00:29:02,00:29:04,"There was all a bit of a misunderstanding,"
00:29:04,00:29:06,and her uncle did what any good uncle would do
00:29:06,00:29:08,"and sent some men round to chop his bulls off,"
00:29:08,00:29:09,and so--
00:29:09,00:29:12,- And they're now hanging in the penis museum in Iceland.
00:29:12,00:29:14,"- Here we go, leave it alone, Anna!"
00:29:14,00:29:16,"He missed the episode, get over it!"
00:29:16,00:29:18,(all laughing)
00:29:18,00:29:21,"- Sorry, Anna. - I'm perfectly preserved."
00:29:21,00:29:24,- This is why you like St. Anselm.
00:29:24,00:29:26,- Because he was an excuse for me to delve back
00:29:26,00:29:30,"into our vlog, my favourite person of the 12th century."
00:29:30,00:29:32,I just love that you've got your testicles chopped off
00:29:32,00:29:33,over a misunderstanding.
00:29:33,00:29:34,- That's terrible.
00:29:34,00:29:38,"- Yeah, St. Anselm's father was called Gandalf."
00:29:38,00:29:40,"- No, no, no. - No, stop it, yeah."
00:29:40,00:29:41,Gandalf. - No.
00:29:41,00:29:42,"- I guess we only think that's funny,"
00:29:42,00:29:44,"'cause Tolkien then went on to use the name,"
00:29:44,00:29:46,"'cause presumably, but that is hilarious."
00:29:46,00:29:49,"- Yeah, yeah, hands up, that's why I find that funny."
00:29:49,00:29:51,(all laughing)
00:29:51,00:29:56,I'm not gonna hide it.
00:29:56,00:29:59,"Gandalf, ironically though, loved his ceremonial star."
00:29:59,00:30:00,- That's true.
00:30:00,00:30:02,"- Whereas Anselm, of course, not a fan."
00:30:02,00:30:03,- That's true.
00:30:03,00:30:07,"- Anselm once was in church with Henry I,"
00:30:07,00:30:11,and he issued the decree of excommunication
00:30:11,00:30:13,"against people who had long hair,"
00:30:13,00:30:17,"because long curly hair had become fashionable in court,"
00:30:17,00:30:19,and he did a sermon that was so convincing
00:30:19,00:30:22,that several of the people with long hair in the church
00:30:22,00:30:25,burst into tears and pulled out their hair
00:30:25,00:30:30,"by its roots, and the king also started crying,"
00:30:30,00:30:34,and one of his assistants had a pair of scissors
00:30:34,00:30:37,and chopped off the king's hair there and then.
00:30:37,00:30:40,"- Wow, that's convincing, that's good rhetoric."
00:30:40,00:30:42,- That is.
00:30:42,00:30:46,- So just on these sort of medieval strange elections
00:30:46,00:30:49,"that happened, and sort of the strangeness of their structure,"
00:30:49,00:30:53,"and how, you know, have you guys heard about the elections"
00:30:53,00:30:55,in the Venetian Republic?
00:30:55,00:30:56,- No.
00:30:56,00:30:56,"- Oh, no."
00:30:56,00:31:01,"- Okay, so medieval Venice was led by the doge, DOGE,"
00:31:01,00:31:06,"and the doge was elected by the great council of Venice, okay?"
00:31:06,00:31:09,"This is a huge council, had lots and lots of members,"
00:31:09,00:31:11,"and it was run by a few noble families,"
00:31:11,00:31:13,"but it had, you know, hundreds of members,"
00:31:13,00:31:14,"and everyone wanted to be the doge,"
00:31:14,00:31:15,"obviously very powerful,"
00:31:15,00:31:18,but the system was designed very carefully
00:31:18,00:31:21,"to stop anyone gaining and keeping power, okay?"
00:31:21,00:31:23,So you had to stop people consolidating their authority
00:31:23,00:31:25,"once they were elected doge, you know?"
00:31:25,00:31:27,So it sort of keeps things in balance.
00:31:27,00:31:30,"So this is how they elected a doge, right?"
00:31:30,00:31:34,"You pick 30 members of the great council at random, okay?"
00:31:34,00:31:37,"Then you pick nine of those 30, also at random, okay?"
00:31:37,00:31:39,You're trying to pick the electing body here.
00:31:39,00:31:40,You've got nine people.
00:31:40,00:31:42,- How are you picking them at random?
00:31:42,00:31:45,You're just sort of throwing a bouquet or something.
00:31:45,00:31:46,"- Names out of a hat, yeah."
00:31:46,00:31:50,"- Those nine members, they then select 40 more members, right?"
00:31:50,00:31:54,"Then of those 40, 12 are randomly picked."
00:31:54,00:31:57,"Those 12 choose 25 more,"
00:31:57,00:31:59,"who are randomly cut down to nine, okay?"
00:31:59,00:32:02,"Those nine then choose another 45,"
00:32:02,00:32:03,of whom 11 are picked at random.
00:32:03,00:32:06,And then those 11 choose 41 more.
00:32:06,00:32:08,Those 41 then vote for the doge.
00:32:08,00:32:13,- Wow. - Exactly.
00:32:13,00:32:13,"- And can I ask,"
00:32:13,00:32:15,what proportion was done by postal voting?
00:32:15,00:32:17,"'Cause if there's any more than 10,"
00:32:17,00:32:19,I don't believe a word of it.
00:32:20,00:32:24,"- I, just reading into some of these mad elections,"
00:32:24,00:32:26,there was that classic one of
00:32:26,00:32:29,after Pope Clement IV died.
00:32:29,00:32:31,They spent three years trying to decide
00:32:31,00:32:32,on who the new Pope was.
00:32:32,00:32:34,And it took so long that eventually
00:32:34,00:32:37,"the citizens of the area got so angry, so pissed off,"
00:32:37,00:32:41,"they locked all of the people voting into a church,"
00:32:41,00:32:44,and they refused to feed them anything.
00:32:44,00:32:45,"So they're just like, get in there,"
00:32:45,00:32:47,"decide on this, no food, no water,"
00:32:47,00:32:49,and they even ripped off the roof of the church
00:32:49,00:32:52,"so that the elements could rain on them and so on,"
00:32:52,00:32:53,just until they had that decision.
00:32:53,00:32:56,And they finally did get that decision.
00:32:56,00:32:57,Pope Gregory X.
00:32:57,00:32:59,- We should say that that instance that you're describing
00:32:59,00:33:01,is the reason that paper elections and conclaves
00:33:01,00:33:03,"happen as they do today, right?"
00:33:03,00:33:05,Conclave means with keys.
00:33:05,00:33:07,And that goes back to that time
00:33:07,00:33:10,where they had to lock them in the bloody church.
00:33:10,00:33:12,"- So the new rule said that after three days of voting,"
00:33:12,00:33:16,"you then, you only get one meal per day from then on."
00:33:16,00:33:19,"Then after eight days, you only get bread and water,"
00:33:19,00:33:22,"plus a little wine, apparently, just softened it."
00:33:22,00:33:26,But the next two popes were elected under those rules.
00:33:26,00:33:29,"And amazingly, they both took under 10 days to decide"
00:33:29,00:33:32,"because the food rules have been changed, that was it."
00:33:32,00:33:36,"- But then in 1292, it took two years again to get a pope."
00:33:36,00:33:38,"- Yeah, the rules fell apart again."
00:33:38,00:33:39,"- They all, yeah. - So they instituted"
00:33:39,00:33:41,the rules and then they stopped obeying them
00:33:41,00:33:43,"for quite a long time. - Yeah, and then that time,"
00:33:43,00:33:45,they only elected a pope because a pissed off hermit
00:33:45,00:33:48,"wrote into them, warning them of divine vengeance"
00:33:48,00:33:50,"that if they didn't elect the pope,"
00:33:50,00:33:51,"and when his letter came in,"
00:33:51,00:33:53,"one of the brothers who picked it up went,"
00:33:53,00:33:54,"""Well, let's just make this guy the pope."""
00:33:54,00:33:56,"And they did, not the hermit."
00:33:56,00:33:59,"- Yeah, he tried to run away, didn't he?"
00:33:59,00:34:00,He genuinely didn't want to.
00:34:00,00:34:04,"I think he was legit, Pietro Damoroni, who was,"
00:34:04,00:34:07,"yeah, he wrote to them being like, decide, they picked him."
00:34:07,00:34:09,"He tried to flee, they stopped him,"
00:34:09,00:34:11,they forced him to go into power.
00:34:11,00:34:14,And only one edict that he passed
00:34:14,00:34:16,when he was in power as pope remained in force.
00:34:16,00:34:17,And that was the edict he passed
00:34:17,00:34:19,"that was the right for a pope to abdicate,"
00:34:19,00:34:21,which he did within five months.
00:34:21,00:34:22,- Yeah.
00:34:22,00:34:26,- Sometimes you can protest too much.
00:34:26,00:34:29,"In the 1190s, in very St. Edmunds,"
00:34:29,00:34:31,they were looking for a new abbot.
00:34:31,00:34:34,"And there was a few different candidates,"
00:34:34,00:34:35,"but of course they were all,"
00:34:35,00:34:37,"""Oh no, I don't want it, I don't want it."""
00:34:37,00:34:40,"But then one of them was really loudly and annoyingly saying,"
00:34:40,00:34:43,"""No, I don't want it, anyone, don't vote for me."""
00:34:43,00:34:46,"""Whatever you do, don't vote for me."""
00:34:46,00:34:47,"And everyone thought that really,"
00:34:47,00:34:49,he was actually campaigning
00:34:49,00:34:50,'cause he was like shouting a lot
00:34:50,00:34:52,and like making himself seen.
00:34:52,00:34:54,"And everyone thought that really,"
00:34:54,00:34:55,he was taking the piss a little bit.
00:34:55,00:34:58,"And then he was killed by a collapsing beam,"
00:34:58,00:35:01,"which all the other priests saw as a sign from God,"
00:35:01,00:35:03,"but yep, he was definitely,"
00:35:03,00:35:05,he was definitely taking the piss.
00:35:05,00:35:07,- Did all the other priests have to bury the chainsaws
00:35:07,00:35:10,that they brought to that meeting very quickly?
00:35:11,00:35:14,- I would love it if political campaigns
00:35:14,00:35:15,the day just involved the politicians
00:35:15,00:35:17,all insisting loudly they didn't want it.
00:35:17,00:35:18,- It would be fun.
00:35:18,00:35:19,- It would be fun.
00:35:19,00:35:21,- If they were trying to force your hand
00:35:21,00:35:22,onto the Bible at the inauguration
00:35:22,00:35:24,"and he was saying, ""No, I don't want, no,"
00:35:24,00:35:25,"I'm not touching it, no."""
00:35:25,00:35:27,(laughing)
00:35:27,00:35:29,- Used to be like that in America.
00:35:29,00:35:31,So when Horace Greeley ran against
00:35:31,00:35:33,"Ulysses S. Grant in 1872,"
00:35:33,00:35:36,"he was the first one who went across a whole country,"
00:35:36,00:35:38,kind of canvassing for votes.
00:35:38,00:35:40,"And all Grant's team, they just mocked him for it."
00:35:40,00:35:42,"And they said, ""Look, this is just,"
00:35:42,00:35:43,I can't believe what you're doing.
00:35:43,00:35:47,This is not the right way to want to become president.
00:35:47,00:35:49,"If you want a president who is a humble man,"
00:35:49,00:35:50,we don't want someone who's shouting
00:35:50,00:35:52,"from the rooftops that I'm the best."""
00:35:52,00:35:53,"- God, that's interesting."
00:35:53,00:35:54,And when was that?
00:35:54,00:35:56,That was kind of 1880 odd or?
00:35:56,00:35:58,"- 1872, yeah."
00:35:58,00:36:00,"- Sorry, okay, yeah."
00:36:00,00:36:02,"- And actually it's still the rule in America really,"
00:36:02,00:36:05,or it's supposed to be that if you're going to be
00:36:05,00:36:08,"the running mate of a potential president,"
00:36:08,00:36:10,then you're not supposed to campaign for that.
00:36:10,00:36:12,And that's now you're not supposed to do that.
00:36:12,00:36:15,"So whenever, yeah, when Joe Biden was looking"
00:36:15,00:36:16,"for his running mate and he said,"
00:36:16,00:36:18,"""I'm definitely going to have a woman."
00:36:18,00:36:19,"We don't know who it is yet,"
00:36:19,00:36:20,"but I'll definitely be a woman."""
00:36:20,00:36:22,Obviously all of the journalists would ask
00:36:22,00:36:25,"all of the main probable candidates,"
00:36:25,00:36:26,would you be up for it?
00:36:26,00:36:27,"And a couple of them said,"
00:36:27,00:36:28,"""Yeah, I'd definitely be up for it."""
00:36:28,00:36:31,"And then a lot of the commentators in America said,"
00:36:31,00:36:32,"""Well, that's not really on."
00:36:32,00:36:33,You're not really supposed to do that.
00:36:33,00:36:34,"You're supposed to say,"
00:36:34,00:36:37,"""Well, if it comes my way, I'll see what happens,"
00:36:37,00:36:40,"but I'm really, I'm concentrating on campaigning"
00:36:40,00:36:43,"for the president and stuff like that."""
00:36:43,00:36:44,"- I guess that still happens, doesn't it?"
00:36:44,00:36:46,"Like in British politics,"
00:36:46,00:36:47,"they say, ""Do you want to be prime minister?"""
00:36:47,00:36:50,"And they say, ""No, I'm doing the job."""
00:36:50,00:36:52,"- That's what Rishi Sunak says every week, isn't it?"
00:36:52,00:36:53,- Yeah.
00:36:53,00:36:55,(all laughing)
00:36:55,00:36:56,- It's so transparent.
00:36:56,00:36:58,I wonder if it was as grotesquely transparent
00:36:58,00:36:59,"as this in the olden days,"
00:36:59,00:37:02,"when even the nice ones, you know, AOC and people,"
00:37:02,00:37:04,"no, it wouldn't cross my mind, be president."
00:37:04,00:37:06,"No, I don't, I just, I'm just here for the people,"
00:37:06,00:37:07,for the do good thing.
00:37:07,00:37:08,"I wish someone would just say,"
00:37:08,00:37:10,the only reason I'm in this job
00:37:10,00:37:12,is to achieve ultimate power.
00:37:12,00:37:13,(all laughing)
00:37:13,00:37:15,- I've just got one more thing
00:37:15,00:37:17,about electoral malpractice.
00:37:17,00:37:19,"This is actually a recent story,"
00:37:19,00:37:21,got sent to me on Twitter by Kata Ovary.
00:37:21,00:37:23,So thank you to you.
00:37:23,00:37:26,"This is about the New Zealand Bird of the Year competition,"
00:37:26,00:37:29,which has identified 1500 fraudulent votes.
00:37:29,00:37:31,So there has been voter fraud in one election this year.
00:37:31,00:37:33,"- Can I just ask,"
00:37:33,00:37:36,how often in the New Zealand Bird of the Year
00:37:36,00:37:38,the competition does the Kiwi not win?
00:37:38,00:37:39,'Cause it feels like-
00:37:39,00:37:43,"- I had no idea, the field is wide open."
00:37:43,00:37:44,- Really? - It's amazing.
00:37:44,00:37:46,"Yeah, I mean, in this case,"
00:37:46,00:37:47,there was a lot of tampering
00:37:47,00:37:49,"on behalf of the little spotted Kiwi,"
00:37:49,00:37:52,"which got 1500 fraudulent votes,"
00:37:52,00:37:53,"got pushed to the top of the leaderboard,"
00:37:53,00:37:55,"they've been removed, but no, it's wide open."
00:37:55,00:37:57,"So, and this is not the first time"
00:37:57,00:37:59,this election has been tampered with.
00:37:59,00:38:01,"So there's a whole report about this in Vice,"
00:38:01,00:38:03,"which said this, in 2015,"
00:38:03,00:38:05,two teenage girls tried to rig the results
00:38:05,00:38:07,in favour of the cock-a-co.
00:38:07,00:38:10,"In 2017, a number of fake email accounts were created"
00:38:10,00:38:13,to boost the polls in favour of the white-faced Heron.
00:38:13,00:38:15,"And in 2018, someone voted for the shag"
00:38:15,00:38:17,"more than 3,000 times."
00:38:17,00:38:21,(all laughing)
00:38:21,00:38:23,- I didn't even know Boris Johnson was in New Zealand.
00:38:23,00:38:25,(all laughing)
00:38:25,00:38:27,"- That's the same guy Googling Shinga,"
00:38:27,00:38:29,"the British New Zealand West, I don't know."
00:38:29,00:38:32,(upbeat music)
00:38:35,00:38:37,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:38:37,00:38:38,And that is my fact.
00:38:38,00:38:41,My fact this week is that the reason America
00:38:41,00:38:45,"has a national anthem is down to Robert Ripley,"
00:38:45,00:38:46,believe it or not.
00:38:46,00:38:49,"- Mm, that's very clever wording,"
00:38:49,00:38:50,'cause who's gonna think we'll believe it or not?
00:38:50,00:38:53,"- I felt yucky saying that, it looked fine on the page."
00:38:53,00:38:55,"When it came out of my mouth, that was a bit weird."
00:38:55,00:38:59,"So, Robert Ripley, the creator of the very famous"
00:38:59,00:39:01,Believe It or Not series of books and museums
00:39:01,00:39:06,"around the world, wrote in 1929 that the star-spangled banner"
00:39:06,00:39:10,had never actually formally been adopted by America
00:39:10,00:39:12,as the national anthem.
00:39:12,00:39:14,"It was used in lots of ceremonies,"
00:39:14,00:39:17,"it was done everywhere, and he got a lot of angry mail"
00:39:17,00:39:18,"from that saying, ""How dare you say that?"""
00:39:18,00:39:21,"Until it was realized that actually constitutionally,"
00:39:21,00:39:23,it wasn't officially their anthem.
00:39:23,00:39:25,"So, five million people signed a petition"
00:39:25,00:39:27,that was forwarded onto Congress.
00:39:27,00:39:31,"And eventually in 1931, President Hoover signed a law"
00:39:31,00:39:33,to say this is officially recognized now.
00:39:33,00:39:35,"So, yeah, it's down to Ripley."
00:39:35,00:39:36,"- Amazing. - Thank you, Ripley."
00:39:36,00:39:38,"- Just thanks to Ripley, interestingly."
00:39:38,00:39:42,"So, it had to be proposed that law by a representative."
00:39:42,00:39:46,And it was the man who proposed that was called John Lindtikum.
00:39:46,00:39:48,"And he represented parts of Baltimore,"
00:39:48,00:39:50,"which is what this song is about, isn't it?"
00:39:50,00:39:53,"It's about a fort, Fort McHenry in Baltimore."
00:39:53,00:39:57,"So, get this, Lindtikum himself, the politician,"
00:39:57,00:40:02,"his first wife was a woman called Eugenia Mae Biden,"
00:40:02,00:40:04,who appears from what I can tell
00:40:04,00:40:07,"to be a relative of Joe Biden, distant relative."
00:40:07,00:40:09,- No way. - No way.
00:40:09,00:40:10,"- Yeah, I don't know about a distant relative."
00:40:10,00:40:12,"I mean, he is quite old,"
00:40:12,00:40:14,so she might just be his older sister or something.
00:40:14,00:40:17,(all laughing)
00:40:17,00:40:18,"But yeah, that's amazing."
00:40:18,00:40:20,- He should have made more of that in his campaign.
00:40:20,00:40:23,He might have actually clinched the bloody election properly.
00:40:23,00:40:26,He emphasizes connections to the national anthem.
00:40:26,00:40:29,"- Okay, Donald Jr."
00:40:29,00:40:31,(all laughing)
00:40:31,00:40:33,- It was actually signed as the national anthem
00:40:33,00:40:36,in an executive order by Woodrow Wilson
00:40:36,00:40:38,"about 20 years earlier, wasn't it?"
00:40:38,00:40:41,But it hadn't been properly rubber stamped by Congress.
00:40:41,00:40:44,And it was in 1931 that they rubber stamped it.
00:40:44,00:40:47,"So, it was kind of a half law when Ripley did this"
00:40:47,00:40:52,"and then it became a full, straight on law in 1931."
00:40:52,00:40:54,"- Yeah, and his piece that he did,"
00:40:54,00:40:57,"so this was, he used to do illustrations"
00:40:57,00:40:59,that would sort of have little bits of writing
00:40:59,00:41:01,around it to tell you this fact.
00:41:01,00:41:03,"And in his original illustration,"
00:41:03,00:41:04,"it was a bit controversial,"
00:41:04,00:41:05,"the wording that he used for it,"
00:41:05,00:41:08,"because he said, ""America has no national anthem."""
00:41:08,00:41:10,So that was his big headline statement.
00:41:10,00:41:13,"Then he said, ""The USA, brackets being a dry country,"""
00:41:13,00:41:15,"'cause of course prohibition at the time,"
00:41:15,00:41:17,"""has been using, without authorization,"
00:41:17,00:41:20,"""a vulgar old English drinking song."""
00:41:20,00:41:24,"So, he was sort of doubling down on not only is it not our song,"
00:41:24,00:41:28,but it's completely against what our government stands for
00:41:28,00:41:30,"at the moment, pencil the sort of outrage."
00:41:30,00:41:33,"- But wait, so then he petitioned to have the vulgar old"
00:41:33,00:41:36,English drinking song actually formally institutes.
00:41:36,00:41:37,"- No, that was separate to him."
00:41:37,00:41:39,"He just, this was him putting out a fact."
00:41:39,00:41:42,This was people randomly realizing we need to petition.
00:41:42,00:41:44,He didn't push that at all.
00:41:44,00:41:45,"- But then they did adopt the drinking song,"
00:41:45,00:41:46,"of course, didn't they?"
00:41:46,00:41:48,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:41:48,00:41:51,"- Because the Star Spangled Banner,"
00:41:51,00:41:54,the tune came from a society in the London Dintic
00:41:54,00:41:56,"called the Anacriotic Society,"
00:41:56,00:41:59,which was like a drinking club on the Strand
00:41:59,00:42:01,and in various parts of London.
00:42:01,00:42:03,And you would go down and you would drink
00:42:03,00:42:04,and you would sing this song.
00:42:04,00:42:05,- It sort of sounded like an 18th century
00:42:05,00:42:07,"Bullingdon Club a little bit, didn't it?"
00:42:07,00:42:08,- Yeah.
00:42:08,00:42:09,"- A gentleman hanging out drinking,"
00:42:09,00:42:10,"except for actually not as fun,"
00:42:10,00:42:12,because they met once a month.
00:42:12,00:42:14,"And it was fun on the one hand,"
00:42:14,00:42:17,but it did start with a three hour long instrumental concert
00:42:17,00:42:19,to have your supper.
00:42:19,00:42:20,- No.
00:42:20,00:42:21,"- Yeah, they dropped that."
00:42:21,00:42:24,- And then it only lasted a few years.
00:42:24,00:42:27,It came to an end when the Duchess of Devonshire
00:42:27,00:42:29,attended one of the meetings.
00:42:29,00:42:31,And then they started singing some of these
00:42:31,00:42:33,quite ribald songs.
00:42:33,00:42:36,And she was not very happy about it at all.
00:42:36,00:42:38,And it wasn't just that she wasn't very happy.
00:42:38,00:42:40,It was that the people singing them felt
00:42:40,00:42:42,that they couldn't really sing these rude songs
00:42:42,00:42:44,in front of a lady.
00:42:44,00:42:47,And so they slowly stopped singing them.
00:42:47,00:42:50,And then resigned one after another that same night.
00:42:50,00:42:53,"And just all went, no, no, actually,"
00:42:53,00:42:54,I'm not doing this anymore.
00:42:54,00:42:57,"And one after another, they all left until"
00:42:57,00:42:58,there was only a couple of people left
00:42:58,00:43:00,and the Duchess of Devonshire.
00:43:00,00:43:01,And the Duchess of--
00:43:01,00:43:01,- What a buzz kill.
00:43:01,00:43:03,"- I know, I know."
00:43:03,00:43:05,"I mean, the thing is that she really wasn't a buzz kill."
00:43:05,00:43:07,"Like Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire,"
00:43:07,00:43:10,"she was the great, great, great, great aunt"
00:43:10,00:43:12,of Diana Princess of Wales.
00:43:12,00:43:16,And she was really famous for being kind of a bit out there
00:43:16,00:43:18,as far as Duchesses were concerned.
00:43:18,00:43:22,"She was always drinking, she was gambling."
00:43:22,00:43:25,She got in real trouble in the election in 1974
00:43:25,00:43:29,because of claims that she was trading kisses for votes.
00:43:29,00:43:30,"- Oh, really?"
00:43:30,00:43:32,"- Guy Fox, yeah. - Not 1974, presumably."
00:43:32,00:43:33,1774?
00:43:33,00:43:35,"- Well, weirdly, it's 1784."
00:43:35,00:43:36,So I'm not sure.
00:43:36,00:43:40,I got the one in the far right in that.
00:43:40,00:43:42,- That's all that matters.
00:43:42,00:43:44,"- But yeah, apparently she said"
00:43:44,00:43:47,that she would kiss a particular butcher
00:43:47,00:43:49,if he voted for this Guy Fox.
00:43:49,00:43:52,"And then supporters of William Pitt said,"
00:43:52,00:43:55,"well, that is just basically a kins of prostitution."
00:43:55,00:43:57,So this is gonna be a massive scandal
00:43:57,00:43:58,and it became a massive scandal.
00:43:58,00:44:01,Although it seems when we look at it now
00:44:01,00:44:04,"from the future, it looks like perhaps it wasn't even her"
00:44:04,00:44:06,"who was saying this, it might have been her sister."
00:44:06,00:44:09,"- Wait, was her sister saying, I will kiss the butcher?"
00:44:09,00:44:10,"Or was she saying, I'll get my sister,"
00:44:10,00:44:13,"the Duchess of Devonshire to kiss you, Mr Butcher?"
00:44:13,00:44:16,"- What I believe happened is the sister said,"
00:44:16,00:44:18,I'll kiss the butcher if you vote for Fox.
00:44:18,00:44:22,And the papers thought it was the Duchess of Devonshire
00:44:22,00:44:22,who'd done this.
00:44:22,00:44:25,"- Oh, so the sister was like the dodgy relative"
00:44:25,00:44:28,who's dragging down a proper political campaign.
00:44:28,00:44:29,"- Kind of, yeah."
00:44:29,00:44:30,Although really it was just an excuse
00:44:30,00:44:32,"for the Pitt team to just, you know."
00:44:32,00:44:34,"- Yeah, it's such an ineffective method"
00:44:34,00:44:35,of winning an election as well.
00:44:35,00:44:38,"If you have to transport someone around the country,"
00:44:38,00:44:41,"kissing everyone, every butcher, yeah."
00:44:41,00:44:44,- Did this poor butcher end up getting a kiss for God's sake
00:44:44,00:44:46,from the Duchess or her sister?
00:44:46,00:44:47,That's what I wanna know.
00:44:47,00:44:49,Everyone forgets about the butcher in this story.
00:44:49,00:44:51,"- The butcher did, the butcher got a kiss."
00:44:51,00:44:53,"- Thank God. - And I think that was,"
00:44:53,00:44:56,"if she had just said, I might give you a kiss if you vote,"
00:44:56,00:44:58,"then it might not have been so bad,"
00:44:58,00:45:00,but it was the fact that she did the kiss
00:45:00,00:45:01,and then he voted.
00:45:01,00:45:04,"So they were like, yeah, that's bang on prostitution."
00:45:04,00:45:07,"- She was, she was a cool dude though."
00:45:07,00:45:10,It must have been a really bad song for it to put her off.
00:45:10,00:45:12,I think if you were ashamed to sing a song in front
00:45:12,00:45:14,"of the Duchess, then actually,"
00:45:14,00:45:16,you shouldn't have been singing the song in the first place.
00:45:16,00:45:18,"- Yeah, but it's very hard, isn't it,"
00:45:18,00:45:19,to sing the star-spangled banner.
00:45:19,00:45:21,"So I've never actually had a crack at it,"
00:45:21,00:45:23,but apparently it's got 19 semitones in it
00:45:23,00:45:25,and it's just such an inappropriate song
00:45:25,00:45:27,for almost everybody's vocal range.
00:45:27,00:45:28,"And mostly when you're watching someone sing it,"
00:45:28,00:45:30,"you're just thinking, are they gonna hit the high note"
00:45:30,00:45:31,or not?
00:45:31,00:45:32,- Yeah.
00:45:32,00:45:35,- I was written by a guy called John Stafford Smith
00:45:35,00:45:37,when he was still a teenager.
00:45:37,00:45:39,He was a lay vicar of Westminster
00:45:39,00:45:41,and he died at the age of 85
00:45:41,00:45:44,from a grape pip lodged in his windpipe.
00:45:44,00:45:45,- No.
00:45:45,00:45:48,"- Well, can I say something about this?"
00:45:48,00:45:49,- Yeah.
00:45:49,00:45:52,"- I wasted a day, I think, trying to track this down."
00:45:52,00:45:55,"So John Stafford Smith, who incidentally never claimed"
00:45:55,00:45:56,"that he'd written the anthem,"
00:45:56,00:45:58,"refused to acknowledge he'd written it,"
00:45:58,00:46:00,"even though everyone in the society was like,"
00:46:00,00:46:01,"yeah mate, you wrote this."
00:46:01,00:46:05,"Now, there's like various books say that the way he died"
00:46:05,00:46:09,"was aged 85 or 86, from a grape pip lodged in his throat."
00:46:09,00:46:12,"But the society, the Anachronian society,"
00:46:12,00:46:15,"was named after this ancient Greek poet, Anachron,"
00:46:15,00:46:19,"sixth century BC poet, who also, according to Pliny the Elder,"
00:46:19,00:46:23,died from choking on a grape pip at the age of 85 or 86.
00:46:23,00:46:27,"Now, this is too much of a coincidence to be possible."
00:46:27,00:46:28,"- No, come on."
00:46:28,00:46:30,- Someone has cocked up those sources.
00:46:30,00:46:31,- You're too skeptical.
00:46:31,00:46:34,"It's definitely, you know, they're both famous drinkers."
00:46:34,00:46:35,They drank wine.
00:46:35,00:46:37,What's wine made out of?
00:46:37,00:46:38,Great.
00:46:38,00:46:41,- It was one of the leading causes of death
00:46:41,00:46:43,"for the over 80s, quite recently."
00:46:43,00:46:45,"- For about 3,000 years, wasn't it?"
00:46:45,00:46:47,"It was, it was."
00:46:47,00:46:49,"Back in the days when you still had pips in the wine,"
00:46:49,00:46:53,"it's nice that we get pitted wine now, isn't it?"
00:46:53,00:46:54,"- So the old vicar, sorry,"
00:46:54,00:46:56,"he's the one who wrote the original,"
00:46:56,00:46:58,did he write the original lyrics?
00:46:58,00:46:59,Or did he write the tune?
00:46:59,00:47:00,"- He wrote the tune. - No, the tune."
00:47:00,00:47:01,"- Sorry, oh yeah."
00:47:01,00:47:03,"So when I was talking about the semitones thing,"
00:47:03,00:47:06,that's about the modern song.
00:47:06,00:47:07,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:47:07,00:47:11,So that was written by a guy called Francis Scott Key.
00:47:11,00:47:14,And he was 35 years old at the time
00:47:14,00:47:18,when he was on a British ship in the Baltimore Harbor
00:47:18,00:47:21,and there was the bombing of Fort McHenry.
00:47:21,00:47:24,And he was watching as all the bombs went down and so on.
00:47:24,00:47:25,And it was in the dawn's early light
00:47:25,00:47:27,"that he saw this massive flag,"
00:47:27,00:47:30,the stars and stripes still flying there
00:47:30,00:47:31,from this vantage point on the boat.
00:47:31,00:47:33,And he just found it so amazing
00:47:33,00:47:37,that he wrote down these lyrics for not that song
00:47:37,00:47:39,just as a poem and it got published in a paper
00:47:39,00:47:42,and it got adapted then by someone else
00:47:42,00:47:44,into that song that we now have.
00:47:44,00:47:46,- Seriously weird moment for him
00:47:46,00:47:47,"because the way it happened was he,"
00:47:47,00:47:51,"the war of 1812 was happening in 1814, as it did."
00:47:51,00:47:53,And he boarded a British ship
00:47:53,00:47:55,to try and negotiate the release of this doctor guy
00:47:55,00:47:56,"who was a good guy,"
00:47:56,00:47:58,who treated lots of British soldiers very well.
00:47:58,00:48:00,"So he boarded this British ship,"
00:48:00,00:48:03,"said, ""Look, give us our doctor back, he's a nice man."""
00:48:03,00:48:05,"And the British guy on the ship,"
00:48:05,00:48:06,"the British general, British Admiral said,"
00:48:06,00:48:09,"""Yeah, absolutely, you have the doctor."
00:48:09,00:48:11,"""Would you mind just waiting a day"
00:48:11,00:48:13,"""because we are about to bomb the absolute shit"
00:48:13,00:48:16,"""out of this harbor right in front of us?"""
00:48:16,00:48:18,And so he then has to sit on the ship
00:48:18,00:48:23,while all the Brits on there sort of flatten his homeland.
00:48:23,00:48:26,"And then, yeah, I guess what else can he do"
00:48:26,00:48:27,except write this poem.
00:48:27,00:48:30,"But the fun thing about it is the flag,"
00:48:30,00:48:32,probably wasn't actually the same flag
00:48:32,00:48:34,that was flying the next morning.
00:48:34,00:48:35,This is according to the History Channel.
00:48:35,00:48:36,"- No. - So when it's like,"
00:48:36,00:48:38,"you know, for just a second,"
00:48:38,00:48:41,"you see by the dawn's early light,"
00:48:41,00:48:42,the flag that you're looking at
00:48:42,00:48:45,is actually a new flag they erected that morning
00:48:45,00:48:49,because the actual flag was so massive
00:48:49,00:48:51,and it was pouring with rain the night of the battle.
00:48:51,00:48:54,"It would have been wet and it would have weighed 500 pounds,"
00:48:54,00:48:55,"well, then 500 pounds,"
00:48:55,00:48:57,which would have snapped the flagpole.
00:48:57,00:49:00,So actually they had to do a replacement mini flag
00:49:00,00:49:02,while the battle was going on.
00:49:02,00:49:07,"And then overnight, the flag erectors got the massive flag back"
00:49:07,00:49:09,and hauled it up the flagpole.
00:49:09,00:49:10,"And so in the morning,"
00:49:10,00:49:13,it was the replaced large flag that he was looking at.
00:49:13,00:49:16,So it hadn't even stayed there during the battle.
00:49:16,00:49:18,"It's a full song, guys."
00:49:18,00:49:20,- This show hasn't even gone out yet.
00:49:20,00:49:21,And already I can hear the fury
00:49:21,00:49:24,of the Americans listening to this episode.
00:49:24,00:49:26,I just hear it in my ears.
00:49:26,00:49:27,Let's get to get us right there.
00:49:27,00:49:29,"- Shall we talk about Ripley instead,"
00:49:29,00:49:30,who's a great American?
00:49:30,00:49:32,- Yeah.
00:49:32,00:49:36,"- So yeah, Ripley, believe it or not,"
00:49:36,00:49:39,"started as a cartoonist, had a bit of spare time"
00:49:39,00:49:43,and so drew some cartoons of crazy things
00:49:43,00:49:44,that athletes had done.
00:49:44,00:49:45,"And that became really, really popular."
00:49:45,00:49:47,And so the next year he did another one.
00:49:47,00:49:48,"And then a few years later,"
00:49:48,00:49:49,he started doing more and more and more
00:49:49,00:49:52,"of these amazing, unbelievable feats"
00:49:52,00:49:54,that people had done and illustrating them himself.
00:49:54,00:49:56,"And then eventually that became, believe it or not."
00:49:56,00:50:00,"- He's basically a one-man QI, it's so interesting."
00:50:00,00:50:03,"And he loved doing the thing that QI loves to do,"
00:50:03,00:50:06,"which is to debunk commonly accepted truths,"
00:50:06,00:50:07,hence the national anthem thing.
00:50:07,00:50:11,"But the brilliant thing about him was how much post he got,"
00:50:11,00:50:14,"'cause he was known as Rip, Robert Ripley."
00:50:14,00:50:17,And people would write to him in a series
00:50:17,00:50:17,of elaborate codes.
00:50:17,00:50:19,So they would write his address backwards
00:50:19,00:50:21,"or upside down or in Braille,"
00:50:21,00:50:24,or they'd draw it on in semaphore flags.
00:50:24,00:50:27,Some people apparently would put a very slight tear
00:50:27,00:50:31,"in the letter, right, i.e. a small rip."
00:50:31,00:50:34,And they would then post that and see if it got to him.
00:50:34,00:50:35,"Anyway, this became so popular"
00:50:35,00:50:38,that the US Postmaster General had to announce
00:50:38,00:50:41,that the Postal Service would no longer be deciphering codes
00:50:41,00:50:42,for people.
00:50:42,00:50:44,"They said, ""No, stop all this bullshit."
00:50:44,00:50:47,"""We just write the address on like normal people."""
00:50:47,00:50:50,- But he was so famous that they tended to know
00:50:50,00:50:50,to send it to him.
00:50:50,00:50:52,"- Yeah, absolutely, yeah."
00:50:52,00:50:54,"- Although I do imagine if that ripping is true,"
00:50:54,00:50:56,that was he also getting loads of letters
00:50:56,00:50:58,"that were loving letters of daughters to mothers,"
00:50:58,00:51:00,which had accidentally got a bit ripped in the post.
00:51:00,00:51:01,- Problems.
00:51:01,00:51:03,- Must be one for Rob.
00:51:03,00:51:06,- And also whenever anyone sent like some flowers
00:51:06,00:51:09,"saying RIP on them, did he get all those as well?"
00:51:09,00:51:11,"- Yeah, he thought he was much more loved"
00:51:11,00:51:12,than he actually was.
00:51:12,00:51:15,- You say he was a one-man QI.
00:51:15,00:51:18,"I think he sort of was, James."
00:51:18,00:51:19,The life he lived was essentially
00:51:19,00:51:21,"traveling around the world,"
00:51:21,00:51:23,"but not going to the normal places most of us travel,"
00:51:23,00:51:25,going to the really weirdo places.
00:51:25,00:51:28,So he could come back and talk about the weird shit he'd seen.
00:51:28,00:51:30,He went to Norway. - Was that a compliment?
00:51:30,00:51:31,'Cause I'm not sure it was.
00:51:31,00:51:34,- I think it is.
00:51:34,00:51:35,- It kind of felt like a compliment
00:51:35,00:51:36,until the word weirdo came in.
00:51:36,00:51:38,And then I wasn't sure.
00:51:38,00:51:39,- It's a QI compliment.
00:51:39,00:51:42,I'm gonna leave you to take it as you see fit.
00:51:42,00:51:45,He went to Norway and immediately visited
00:51:45,00:51:47,"a place called Hel, which is a tiny Norwegian village,"
00:51:47,00:51:48,just for the sake of coming back
00:51:48,00:51:50,and saying he'd been to hell.
00:51:50,00:51:52,"And he went around finding,"
00:51:52,00:51:54,I guess people who before the internet existed
00:51:54,00:51:58,"would have been complete extraordinary people,"
00:51:58,00:52:00,"just people from different cultures,"
00:52:00,00:52:03,"from different tribes, and then reporting on them."
00:52:03,00:52:04,And no one believed him.
00:52:04,00:52:06,"It was like, ""QI, every time he announced something,"
00:52:06,00:52:08,"everyone refused to believe him, didn't they?"""
00:52:08,00:52:12,"- He announced some pretty fruity stuff, in my opinion."
00:52:12,00:52:13,- Oh yeah.
00:52:13,00:52:16,"- Yeah, I mean, he claimed things like,"
00:52:16,00:52:19,"""A Frenchman once drank 13 pints of wine in one breath."""
00:52:19,00:52:21,"And you think, ""Hmm..."""
00:52:21,00:52:22,- Did he? - Okay.
00:52:22,00:52:24,"- Well, believe it or not."
00:52:24,00:52:25,"- The tragic thing was,"
00:52:25,00:52:27,the tragic thing about that was
00:52:27,00:52:29,"that there was a single pit, a great pit,"
00:52:29,00:52:30,right at the end of the party time.
00:52:30,00:52:32,He would have done 40.
00:52:32,00:52:37,"- Okay, that's it."
00:52:37,00:52:38,That is all of our facts.
