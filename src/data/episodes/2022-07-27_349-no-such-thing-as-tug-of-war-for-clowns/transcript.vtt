00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.020
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.260
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.660
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.900
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.260
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.480
 and James Harkin.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.960
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.840
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.760
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.440
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.140
 - My fact is that museums need visitors' breath

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.440
 in order to preserve their exhibits properly.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.280
 - Interesting.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.880
 - Museums rely on the moisture from our bodies

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.660
 to keep their things nice.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.720
 'Cause when you breathe out,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.840
 it's more moist than when you breathe in.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.680
 You breathe in normal air and it takes a bit

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.320
 of your internal juice and it transports it to the outside.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.680
 - Don't say internal juice, that's horrible.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.840
 It's, sorry, Andy, can I just ask with, at the moment

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.480
 with COVID happening, not many people going to museums,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.000
 is there a way that we can donate our internal juice?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.840
 - Yeah, the British Museum is taking donations.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.600
 You just say free post British Museum

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.640
 and you slap that on a big bag of juice.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.920
 And they'll release it among the, yeah.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.720
 So this is according to a curator at the British Museum,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.120
 which has been closed for the longest time in its history.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.880
 And normally they would get about 17,000 visitors a day

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.880
 and all those people and their breath

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.520
 help keep the right level of humidity in the air.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.720
 'Cause they've got so many objects

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.400
 which require certain levels of humidity,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.280
 things that can dry out easily.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.120
 Maybe the object's made of bone,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.560
 which might crack if it gets too low.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.280
 And this is a problem.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.760
 Objects have been at risk of cracking out.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.800
 - So when we all are able to return to museums,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.000
 you're suggesting maybe we should go around

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.760
 spitting on the exhibits?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.160
 - Yes, I am, absolutely.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.400
 - We all have a lot of friends who work in museums.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.000
 So I thought I'd contact a few of those

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.880
 to see if they have the same problems in other museums.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.480
 So one of our friends is Paolo Viscardi

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.360
 at the National Museum of Ireland.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.480
 And he said that this is spot on.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.400
 Their problem is less with people breathing out so much,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.080
 but more that when you open the door normally,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.120
 it would bring in a lot of moisture from outside

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.400
 because it's always pissing it down and doubling.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.800
 And so basically you would open the door

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.320
 and that would bring in moisture from outside

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.880
 and no one's opening the door at the moment.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.360
 So that's a problem.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.240
 I also spoke to our friends at the Penis Museum in Iceland

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.720
 to see if they have any problems with humidity

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.440
 at the moment and Thorda wrote back to me and said,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.080
 they've not had problems with conservation

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.480
 due to lack of humidity.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.480
 We have discontinued stuffing our penises

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.640
 because it led to considerable shrinkage

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.120
 which may prove problematic when you're in the penis business.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.080
 But the few taxidermy specimens we have

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.960
 have actually fared a little bit better due to COVID,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.480
 mainly due to the lack of people touching them.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.320
 - Right.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.000
 - So people aren't touching his penises as much

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.320
 and so things are a bit better for him under COVID.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.320
 - Blessing.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.400
 - And just a reminder for anyone who visits the museum,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.400
 don't spit on them when it's open again.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.560
 People are penises alone.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.040
 Can I just interject here to say how angry I was

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.160
 that you chose the one week I was away

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.840
 to discuss the Icelandic Penis Museum?

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.680
 - Oh, sorry.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.520
 - I just want to mention that that was quite thoughtless.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.160
 I discovered this week when I was listening back,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.960
 you let Sandy Talks speak about it instead of me.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.280
 - I'm really sorry about that.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.760
 When lockdown's over, just come, you can come round

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.080
 and we'll get a bottle of wine out.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.800
 We can talk about the Icelandic Penis Museum.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.760
 - Honestly, Anna. - James, that means so much to me.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.160
 - Anna, we didn't know you listened to the podcast.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.200
 - We thought you did, we of course.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.120
 - I tried to avoid it.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.120
 Someone else had it on in the background.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.480
 But I don't think you did mention

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.400
 they've got their only human penis quite recently.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.200
 - Don't turn this into a penis museum, Jack.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.840
 - I'm getting it back to the penis museum.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.400
 I will make up for that lost time.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.600
 No, I did enjoy a quote from the penis museum

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.720
 when I was looking at how they preserved their objects

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.400
 and they got their first human penis in 2011

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.600
 from the 95-year-old, Pally Arison,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.120
 who promised it, I think, 15 years ago.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.880
 I don't think you mentioned this.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.080
 So he promised it 15 years ago to his friend as the curator,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.280
 lived for an extra 15 years, which possibly wasn't expected.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.320
 And there was an interview with the curator

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.800
 who was looking down at this 95-year-old man's penis,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.440
 which he now has preserved.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.160
 And the independent reporting on it said,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.960
 "Glancing down at the glass container,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.280
 "holding a grayish-brown shriveled mass,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.600
 "he admitted that the preservation had not been successful."

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.200
 (laughing)

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.520
 - Oh, dear.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.200
 - I remember that story because I think there was a race

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.880
 to get the first human penis into the penis museum.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.880
 And it was between this 95-year-old guy

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.840
 and some 27-year-old bloke,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.600
 and whichever of them died first

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.040
 was going to donate their penis.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.640
 - That is a brilliant plot for a murdered novel, isn't it?

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.920
 (laughing)

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.960
 - Right, anyway, anyway.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.520
 - Sorry, I've got that out of my system now.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.480
 You can go back to proper use.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.080
 Anyway, we'll edit that into the previous episode.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.680
 (laughing)

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.840
 - I'd appreciate that.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.160
 - But it's a big, it's a huge problem,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.480
 and it's not the only problem they have.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.040
 So in June, you remember it was a very hot summer this year,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.880
 the British Museum had to specifically send in a curator

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.400
 because they thought that Oliver Cromwell's death mask

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.520
 might melt because it's made of wax,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.360
 and it was so hot in the museum that,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.280
 and that obviously is a very rare and precious thing.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.600
 - But so I assume that even during lockdown,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.200
 there were one or two caretakers

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.320
 that were able to walk around the museum,

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.160
 because for example, with the problem of no one breathing

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.640
 and creating that humidity,

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.840
 they do have sensors, over 700 all around the museum,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.840
 that go off when the temperatures and humidity

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.800
 are not at the right level.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.960
 So they can adjust them.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.800
 They can press buttons to make sure that it regulates.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.080
 It's not entirely reliant on humans breathing on them.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.760
 So I would have assumed there just would have been someone

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.040
 there to put a hat on Oliver Cromwell's death mask

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.880
 or something.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.520
 - I think there are people who can do that.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.400
 They have a few people who go in.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.280
 There's a brilliant interview with James McClain,

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.400
 who I think Dan definitely knows, I would say.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.480
 I'm not sure if you guys know him,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.880
 who's the fish curator at the Natural History Museum.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.640
 And it's been his job during lockdown for some of the time

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.880
 to go and have a look around

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.200
 and make sure that everything's okay.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.960
 So he's had to look after the flesh-eating beetles,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.000
 for instance.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.400
 So they have these beetles there,

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.880
 which strip down the bones.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.280
 Whenever you get a new little animal,

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.320
 you put it in and the beetles eat all the meat off it

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.400
 and you come out with a perfect bone.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.920
 And he's had to feed them so that they don't go looking

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.400
 for other things to eat.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.480
 So he has to give them some conger eel heads

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.640
 to keep them happy.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.480
 - Oh my God.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.640
 - And he said something else in this.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.880
 This is not about conservation,

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.680
 but I thought it was really interesting.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.640
 He says he monitors the alcohol supply system

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.520
 in the Natural History Museum.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.800
 And apparently in the Natural History Museum,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.400
 there is a series of pipes that go through the whole museum.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.280
 Like they're powered by steam power

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.920
 and they fire alcohol through the whole museum.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.680
 And there are little taps in all the rooms

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.120
 where you can just get little bits of pure alcohol

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.000
 if you need it for preservation.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.400
 Isn't that amazing?

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.920
 - That is so cool.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.760
 - It's so cool.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.600
 - Can you drink that?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.440
 Or is that too intense?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.840
 - No, it's pure ethanol.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.760
 So I would advise against it.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.200
 If you ever get stuck in the Natural History Museum,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.240
 then probably, you know, there might be--

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.240
 - Don't check the tap.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.360
 - Don't check the tap.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.960
 Go to check out the staff canteen

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.320
 if you need some alcohol, probably, rather than the taps.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.880
 Otherwise, you've drunk from an ethanol tap,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.960
 you're absolutely hammered

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.160
 and you're in a room surrounded by dead,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.000
 stuffed, giant, extinct animals,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.440
 which sounds like something out of a nightmare.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.360
 - That movie, "The Nice at the Museum"

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.720
 is very different if you've been drinking pure ethanol

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.560
 the night before.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.440
 - It's quite dangerous having all that ethanol there

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.040
 for preservation in the Natural History Museum.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.120
 They have to be careful with bigger animals.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.280
 So I think the head of fish curation,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.560
 who's called Oliver Crimin,

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.960
 or he claims to be the head,

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.800
 but maybe your friend is his rival.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.640
 - They work together.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.040
 Ollie and James work together, yeah.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.400
 - Okay, work together, rivals,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.320
 whatever you wanna call it.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.000
 (laughing)

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.680
 They stuffed their largest fish recently.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.240
 So they've got 900,000 dead fish in there

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.560
 and it was a blue marlin, which was four meters long.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.120
 It washed up in Wales in 2016.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.720
 And I just love the fact that within 24 hours,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.120
 Oliver's there on the beach,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.520
 on the Pembrokeshire coast immediately.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.360
 And it needed 10,000 litres of ethanol,

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.720
 which is what you'd normally preserve it in,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.600
 but that's incredibly flammable and very dangerous.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.040
 That would explode the entire museum if a flame got to it.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.480
 So they had to sort of create this new solution for it,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.320
 glycerol.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.280
 But it's very cool. - 10,000 litres.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.720
 - Yeah, it's big.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.240
 - How big is a marlin?

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.400
 - They're much bigger than I realised.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.120
 They-- - It's like a size of a tuna,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.120
 isn't it, a marlin?

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.920
 - Yeah, marlins are massive.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.000
 - I guess, just that's amazing.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.360
 That is really extraordinary.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.520
 Is one of them, does one of them do the heads of the fish

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.120
 and the other one does the tails of the fish?

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.040
 - Yeah, but they flip for it on the start of each day

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.040
 to see what does it do.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.720
 (laughing)

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.200
 - Just back to the British Museum very quickly.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.600
 What do you suppose the two most popular things

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.040
 in the museum, what do you think the two most popular things

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.200
 are? - Okay.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.120
 - And I'm getting this from a British Museum blog

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.080
 from 2017, so it might have changed since then.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.280
 - Like the mummies, I would say people always go

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.560
 for the mummies, don't they?

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.400
 - I'd say one of the mummies.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.600
 - Boom, number one, Egyptian collection mummies

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.120
 is the number one most searched for thing

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.600
 on their website that people wanna find out about.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.440
 So what's number two?

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.040
 - For number two, I would say maybe the--

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.400
 - Is that a stone, is that in there?

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.680
 - Yeah. - Oh, there is a stone, is there?

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.440
 - I would say the-- - I'd say the Fiji mermaid.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.760
 - Oh, is that the-- - Is that the Elgin marbles?

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.640
 - Oh, the Elgin marbles, yeah, good cool.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.640
 It's actually Japanese erotica, so shunger it's called

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.120
 and these are on panels.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.880
 It's a painting of very erotic Japanese

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.400
 kind of karma sutra-esque looking drawings

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.680
 and there was a big exhibition in 2014,

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.440
 the second most searched for thing on their website,

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.320
 more so than the opening hours,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.280
 it's called Japanese erotica.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.600
 - No way.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.880
 - It's no good knowing the opening hours

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.840
 if you don't know the way to the Japanese erotica.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.280
 - That's what you constantly see,

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.480
 very disappointed looking slightly horny people

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.520
 at two in the morning,

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.720
 looking really angry outside the British Museum.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.840
 Didn't realize they weren't open.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.600
 - Yeah, 40,000 annual searches for shunger on their website

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.400
 and the Egyptian collection gets 53,000.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.400
 - Do we know if that's 40,000 different people

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.280
 or is it one unbelievably horny?

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:49.280
 One cool thing during this whole breath thing,

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.920
 one of the collections of,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.160
 the head of collections care is a woman called Sandra Smith

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.800
 and she said about the breath crisis at the museum,

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.120
 she said, "It was not alarming, that's a bit scaremongering,

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.720
 "but it's fair to say that when we started

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.080
 "watching the moisture dropping,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.440
 "we were all holding our breath

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.880
 "and wanting it to normalize."

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.280
 (laughing)

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.800
 - What, stop it, you idiot.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.400
 (upbeat music)

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:20.160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.000
 - Okay, well, before I say my fact this week,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.200
 I just want to warn any more squeamish listeners

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.000
 that it is kind of gruesome,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.320
 but I want to reassure them that it has a happy ending.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.760
 So, steal yourselves.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.960
 - My fact this week is that in 1997,

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.360
 a mass tug of war went so badly wrong

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.840
 that it ripped two of the contestants' arms off.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.960
 - Anna, no.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.000
 - I'm sorry, all of your guys' faces

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.320
 are making me regret this.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.480
 - We knew what you were gonna say, Anna.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.640
 - Exactly, it doesn't make it any better.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.600
 - As I hear it, it gets worse, actually.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.240
 I'm just gonna say immediately,

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.440
 before I go anywhere near the rest of this,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.600
 that they had some very extensive microsurgery

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.400
 and their arms were reattached

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.240
 along with extensive nerve grafting

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.600
 and they regained their hand functions, okay?

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.200
 So, we're okay to talk about this,

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.440
 a tug of war ripped their arms off.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.040
 And that can happen.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.560
 It was actually meant to be a day of celebration.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.520
 It was in Taiwan and it was the anniversary

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.880
 of the end of Japanese rule.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.680
 It was to celebrate that.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.720
 And 1600 people took part

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.080
 and people don't realize how dangerous tug of war is.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.640
 So, that ended up putting 80,000 kilograms of force

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.120
 on this five centimeter wide nylon rope

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.520
 that could only bear 26,000.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.160
 So, it was kind of impressive that it hung on that long.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.160
 And the rope snapped and the rebound force of it snapping

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.600
 seems to have just torn off the left arms

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.320
 of the two people at the front of each row.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.280
 So, it's kind of amazing physics, I guess.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.720
 That massive force is sitting in the rope

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.040
 when it's being pulled.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.960
 And as soon as the rope breaks,

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.360
 that force has to go somewhere,

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.720
 that energy goes somewhere.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.800
 And so, it immediately goes straight into the body

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.720
 of the person who's at the front of the row

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.880
 who essentially pulls his body away from his arm.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.600
 - I'm so squeamish that I actually didn't do

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.720
 any further research on this specific incident

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.560
 that happened.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.800
 And so, I assumed that it was just that they got tugged

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.040
 at the wrong moment or that like the other 3,000 people

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.600
 on the other team all pulled at the same time

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.600
 and only one person had turned up for their own tea

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.920
 or whatever.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.320
 (laughing)

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.360
 - It was not that.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.560
 - It was interesting 'cause it was a slightly different

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.000
 to the normal tug of war, I think, that we have

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.600
 in that there were lots of branches that came off the rope.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.400
 So, it wasn't just like, let's say it was 16,000 people.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.480
 It wasn't 8,000 people pulling on one end of the rope

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.520
 and 8,000 people on the other.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.240
 All the rope had loads of kind of bits coming off it

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.160
 that people would pull on the side.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.960
 'Cause that's the way they do it in Taiwan.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.120
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.960
 Depending on your level of squeamishness,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.080
 there is a really good Snopes article on it.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.880
 The picture in which I found extremely confusing.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.920
 So, it does show a man lying on the ground

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.200
 after the tug of war next to his arm.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.000
 And then the only other person in shot is a cameraman

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.480
 who's sitting there with his back to this man,

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.680
 pointing the camera in a completely different direction.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.760
 Now, what I wanna know is, what in God's name

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.440
 is he taking a photo of?

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.440
 That is more interesting than that.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.440
 - Oh, man.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.360
 Well, there were two guys, right?

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.480
 Maybe it's the other guy.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.920
 - There were two guys on the arm.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.360
 Imagine coming around after extensive microsurgery,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.920
 hearing the surgeon saying, don't worry,

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.040
 we have brilliant medical science these days.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.280
 We've managed to reattach your arm.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.480
 You look down and you think, that's not my watch.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.440
 - This happens a lot, right?

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.000
 And not enough that it's a sort of public announcement

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.240
 to say, stop doing tug of war.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.200
 But this isn't a one-off.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.560
 There are cases that you can read.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.800
 - Don't say one-off.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.640
 (all laughing)

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.000
 - But sadly, in these mass tug of wars,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.120
 people do lose hands.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.960
 In some cases, sadly, some people have died.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.400
 But it's only with these mega, these mega tug of wars.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.880
 - I think one of the problems is that

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.400
 in professional tug of war, they have rules, right?

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.240
 They have very strict rules of what you're allowed to do

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.520
 and what you're not allowed to do.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.240
 If you just get a load of people,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.880
 like 1600 people pulling on a bit of rope,

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.800
 they're not gonna necessarily follow

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.240
 all the health and safety things.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.760
 The main problem is when you wrap it around yourself

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.400
 to kind of pull.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.480
 And that's obviously a problem.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.960
 In a professional tug of war,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.600
 you're not allowed to do that at all.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.240
 - It's amazing how widespread tug of war seems to have been

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.560
 throughout history and all around the world, isn't it?

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.400
 So in Thailand, it happens at Buddhist funerals,

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.200
 I think, in Thailand and Burma.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.320
 And it's only if you're a really high up Buddhist,

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.040
 if you're a really senior monk,

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.640
 then there's a massive tug of war over your corpse.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.520
 - Not over your actual corpse.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.440
 - Okay, well, it's over your hearse with the corpse on it.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.080
 And this is, it sounds kind of fun.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.440
 Your body's put on a cart and it's pulled to this field

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.520
 and it's gonna be cremated.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.240
 But first of all, all the villagers gather around

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.240
 and they pull at the cart on either side.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.200
 Sometimes this goes on for days

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.200
 of just pulling the cart one way

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.480
 and then the rope snaps

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.760
 and the other team pull it a long way the other way.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.080
 And they get cheerleaders and they have megaphones

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.680
 with people kind of egging one team on.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.560
 And with just with this Buddhist monk's body

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.280
 rollicking around on the cart for a while.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.120
 - Wow.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.600
 - And I think the idea is that it's a way

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.120
 of getting all the goodness out of the monk,

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.320
 all the merit they call it before you cremate him.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.920
 And it sounds like an absolute laugh.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.440
 (all laughing)

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.800
 - I was reading about professional tug of war

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.400
 and the world championships and stuff like that.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.840
 And the best women's team is from Taiwan.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.360
 They are unbelievably good.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.480
 They've won every single world championship to date.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.440
 - Right, wow.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.520
 - But they go under the name of Chinese Taipei

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.280
 because obviously there's political things

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.000
 between China and the Taiwanese.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.980
 And so they compete under the name Chinese Taipei.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.680
 But whenever they play China,

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.920
 they always want to absolutely smash them, okay?

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.680
 I read an interview with one of the players

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.360
 called Chen Lihui.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.160
 And she said that when she played against the Chinese,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.400
 they could have beaten them really, really quickly.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.960
 And she says, "But instead we tortured them slowly

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.160
 before making them lose."

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.560
 So they just kind of make it look like

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.880
 they're gonna win, look like they're gonna win,

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.720
 look like they're gonna win.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.560
 And then they smashed them.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.880
 - Oh, my goodness.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.880
 - That's amazing.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.080
 - Yeah, I watched a professional tug of war match

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.320
 just this morning and it was very different

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.040
 to how I pictured it would be.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.720
 As in I thought you would have the gun or whatever go, go off.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.920
 And it would be kind of just kind of a lot of pulling,

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.720
 a lot of just, come on, let's do this, a lot of tugging.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.640
 But what happens in the one that I saw

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.400
 and this was a finals and it was, I think it was England

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.920
 and someone else, they basically, they started it

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.680
 and they go completely rigid.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.240
 They put their feet in, they lock down and they hold

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.040
 and they're pulling really hard,

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.560
 but there's no movement whatsoever.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.480
 And this match lasted nine minutes long

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.120
 and for the first five or so minutes,

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.800
 it was just them basically holding firm.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.480
 I think with a tension that I guess it just tires you out

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.840
 a bit and then you make your move.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.160
 So it's a sort of, but it's very boring

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.440
 for the first five minutes.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.400
 You're just staring at people leaning backwards.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.320
 - I read, it's not a good spectator score.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.560
 Yeah, it's just motionless, motionless, motionless.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.840
 Oh, a load of people have fallen over the end.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.960
 I read one article and this was in the physics website.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.800
 So they weren't going on the sporting side of it,

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.440
 but they reckoned that it's just basically about friction.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.480
 It's not even about how strong you are.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.160
 Because if you think about it, if you're pulling on a rope

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.600
 which is attached to a wall, you can pull it

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.600
 as hard as you want.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.400
 And if you pull and pull and pull, all you're gonna do

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.080
 is move yourself closer to the wall.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.080
 You're not gonna move the wall

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.720
 because the wall is stuck there.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.160
 And so the idea is that if the other team

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.760
 has got a really good face and really stuck

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.960
 on the floor with good friction with nice solid boots

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.160
 and you're on ice, you could be a million times

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.560
 stronger than them, but all you're gonna do

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.800
 is pull yourself closer to them.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.760
 You're not gonna pull them closer to you.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.440
 - So I read a lot of the Tug of War International

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.880
 Federation Rulebook in preparation for this recording.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.400
 Oh my God, they're called TWIFT for short.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.960
 And their rules are so good.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.160
 They're so interesting.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.320
 So there are all kinds of rules.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.520
 There's a whole page about doping in Tug of War.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.280
 Not allowed.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.680
 And there's not much anyway, 'cause why would you?

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.520
 - But the rules about shoes--

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.280
 - What? 'Cause it makes you stronger, Charlie.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.080
 - Well, but it doesn't give you more friction.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.120
 It doesn't, you know. - Oh, you can't take--

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.800
 - You can't take a drug that makes you rough.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.200
 Yeah. (laughing)

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.400
 - It would need to be a stickiness.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.720
 You want sticky feet, don't you?

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.480
 - Well, this is exactly, this is why the shoes section

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.560
 of TWIFT rules is so enormous and comprehensive.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.200
 You aren't allowed to have shoes

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.680
 that are more than 20% longer than your feet.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.120
 Because when you think about it, that is--

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.200
 - That's why the clouds won the first five Olympics

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.640
 didn't they? (laughing)

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.640
 - They would win, wouldn't they?

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.280
 Because they've just got so much more surface

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.800
 in contact with the ground.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.760
 Like, what?

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.720
 And there are all these things you could be banned for.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.280
 You could be banned for sitting down.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.440
 That's happened in, when it was an Olympic sport,

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.200
 actually, the British team ones got banned for sitting.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.240
 It's not really sitting down.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.960
 It's falling over. - Well, actually,

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.160
 the first ever rules, I read them and explicitly,

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.680
 it says sitting on another member of your team

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.040
 is not permitted. (laughing)

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.600
 - Fair, that is fair.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.360
 - But also not trying hard enough

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.800
 is a disqualifiable offense.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.640
 - Really?

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.200
 - So it says in the rules,

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.280
 teams failing to actively engage in the competitive effort

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.720
 during a pull leading to a prolonged stalemate

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.280
 which could bring the sport into disrepute.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.280
 - But that's what I was saying, basically,

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.160
 what the Chinese Taipei/Taiwanese team were doing.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.560
 Like, deliberately not trying hard to try and make it.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.560
 - Well, they gotta watch out then, yeah.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.760
 - That's very interesting.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.920
 TWIFT is a wonderful website, by the way.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.760
 - I read the latest newsletter.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.680
 They've just celebrated their 60th anniversary

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.200
 as the Tug of War International Federation.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.640
 Sadly, due to COVID, aren't able to meet up

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.600
 to be there with each other.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.440
 So they're gonna do it next year.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.280
 - It's the perfect sport.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.120
 It's the perfect sport

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.440
 for keeping people at fixed two-meter intervals.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.680
 (laughing)

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.320
 - Yeah, so they're gonna be meeting up next year

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.320
 for their 60th plus one anniversary in 2021.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.360
 And I was reading their mission statement

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.400
 and the mission statement basically is,

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.000
 their main objective is they want this

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.520
 to become an Olympic sport again.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.920
 They're desperate to get it back in the Olympics

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.160
 'cause in the early Olympics,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.240
 they were five Olympics that they were a part of,

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.480
 I think, was it?

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.640
 1920, I think, was the last that they ever did.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.080
 And Britain, the holders of the,

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.720
 well, not necessarily Britain, the holders,

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.720
 because it's actually a very specific bit of Britain.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.000
 It is the city of London police

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.840
 who are the reigning Olympic champions of tug of war.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.520
 And yeah, and they're constantly trying

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.560
 to get it back into the Olympics,

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.600
 but it's not happened yet.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.200
 And I think it should go back in.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.560
 It's no different to the discus.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.440
 It's no different to, yeah, I think it's quite a...

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.680
 - Yeah, but it's no different to egg and spoon race

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.320
 or that race where you run across,

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.040
 put a different item of clothing on each time

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.480
 until you look like a farmer.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.000
 That's not the answer.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.040
 - It requires much, much less skill than those.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.360
 It requires being fat and having spikes in your shoes.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.840
 - No, no, no, no.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.840
 It is, it's not just about strength, as we know.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.480
 It's skill as well.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.680
 - No, that's what I'm saying.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.440
 It's not about, it's nothing to do with strength.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.040
 It's about standing there and being heavy.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.080
 - Heavy is nothing to do with it.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.280
 - I found it really interesting

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.760
 that we've got two people,

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.520
 me and Anna on the side of tug of war is not a skill spot.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.600
 And then we've got you two on the other side

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.080
 pulling in your direction.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.520
 - Only one way to settle it.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.640
 - I am pro of the Olympic claim

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.440
 because Great Britain did seem to absolutely smash it.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.640
 'Cause not only did the police team win,

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.200
 we were allowed to submit various teams.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.880
 And I think Great Britain won all three medals in 1908,

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.240
 as well as winning various medals in the race.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.440
 - But it wasn't just Great Britain

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.800
 winning all three medals.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.240
 It was specific police forces from Britain winning all three.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.080
 So the city of London took gold,

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.320
 Liverpool's police force won silver,

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.440
 and then more other London policemen took the bronze medal.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.000
 It could not have been a more decent thing.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.160
 - It was quite controversial though,

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.840
 because the Liverpool team,

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.240
 there is a suggestion that they were wearing

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.240
 such enormous shoes.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.600
 And according to some people who wrote about it at the time,

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.960
 their shoes were so heavy

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.160
 that they could only just lift their feet off the floor

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.160
 after they had to leave the arena.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.600
 - Well, so if you read the latest newsletter

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.680
 from the TWIFT website,

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.120
 there's an actual breakdown

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.000
 of how a lot of these problems were solved

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.920
 by one of the founding members who helped us solve it,

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.320
 which is when they had their first international matches,

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.200
 every different country had different rules

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.160
 for what they were allowed to do,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.160
 different size shoes, different grips,

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.880
 different laying down on stuff.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.840
 And so it was this guy who writes his historical piece

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:04.680
 in the newsletter,

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.040
 who says that he got together with everyone

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.600
 and they sort of internationalized the rules for tug of war,

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.280
 so that there's now one solid way

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.160
 that if you enter this competition,

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.320
 you can only perform it.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.000
 - I really hope that the TWIFT website

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.600
 gets a massive spike in visitors.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.560
 If you're listening to this,

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.480
 just please go to the TWIFT website

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.160
 'cause I want whoever runs the TWIFT website

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.000
 to say, like, phone his colleagues,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.520
 it's finally happening, we're doing it.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.720
 - TWIFT just sounds like a swear word you use

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.960
 when you've got a toddler around

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.960
 so you can't say the actual word, doesn't it?

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.640
 It's an absolute TWIFT.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.640
 I think that there should just be the prerequisite

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.760
 that if you cannot mount the podiums to claim your medal

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.240
 'cause your shoes are too heavy,

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.560
 that's automatic disqualification.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.480
 - I'll just chuck it down here, that's fine.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:55.280
 - Imagine the very start of the Olympics

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.880
 where they're all marching around the stadium

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.480
 with a big flag and you've just got the tug of war

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.360
 so you're dragging their feet along.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.960
 Here they come, the tug of war competitors.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.040
 It always slows down for this bit.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.040
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.320
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in medieval elections,

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.120
 you were supposed to object to any suggestion

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.640
 that you wanted to win.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.080
 When he became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1093,

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.880
 St. Anselm refused to accept the ceremonial staff

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:37.040
 so they had to break his fingers to force it into his hand.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.880
 - Come on.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.760
 - This is, and if you go on Snopes,

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.680
 you can see photographs of the hand being broken.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.640
 - No, obviously not.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.840
 - There's a scribe looking at something else.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.840
 What is he looking at?

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:57.000
 - So I read this from BBC History Magazine.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.480
 It's an article by Professor Bjorn Weiler

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.320
 from Aberystwyth University

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.880
 and it's about medieval elections

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.920
 that took place around that time.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.080
 And there were always elections for things like bishops

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.000
 and archbishops and popes and councils and stuff like that.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.680
 Sometimes also kings, some kings were elected,

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.720
 which I didn't know.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.560
 But the idea was that whoever won

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.560
 was gonna be whatever God wanted.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.720
 And you shouldn't really want to have power over other people

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.840
 if you're a holy good person.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.240
 And so you wouldn't try and go around

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.520
 getting people to vote for you or anything like that.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.320
 It was really, really looked down on.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.720
 You should just accept the nomination, accept the win

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.920
 and say, well, I didn't really want this,

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.160
 but since you insist, I'm gonna do it.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.640
 And then Saint Anselm, he got the archbishopship of Canterbury

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.600
 and they had to give him the staff as part of the ceremony,

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.720
 but he was like, no, I'm still gonna pretend

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.240
 that I don't want this.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.080
 And they had to break it.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.120
 - You'll have to force that ceremonial staff

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.520
 into my dead hands.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.040
 - Oh, so he was definitely acting?

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.960
 - Well, actually probably not, 'cause he was a saint.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.320
 And if you believe all the stories about Saint Anselm,

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.120
 he was an extremely pious man who didn't want any...

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.600
 It's funny 'cause he's quite a famous saint

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.000
 and he did lots of cool stuff, but all the way through,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.080
 it's like, oh, no, I don't really want anyone

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.040
 to know who I am, oh, no.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.000
 Like he deliberately went to become the number two

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.760
 of a very famous monk, because the other guy was so famous,

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.960
 he thought that will deflect all the fame off me.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.320
 - He's like the two fish curators

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.520
 at the Natural History Museum is what we're saying.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.120
 (all laughing)

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.520
 I love, it's such a funny, although he wouldn't have been

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.720
 a saint at the time, I guess.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.560
 He would have just been Mr. Anselm.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.920
 - So, yeah, probably not Mr. Anselm.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.680
 - Yeah, Mr. Anselm.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.560
 - We should just say, he obviously set an example

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.160
 that a lot of world leaders follow today

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.800
 in his reluctance for power.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.720
 I like Anselm because he's the father of scholasticism,

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.080
 so which was a massive deal,

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.040
 which was basically the biggest intellectual movement

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.480
 of the late middle ages.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.640
 Stop laughing, Andy, that's not why I like him.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.460
 (all laughing)

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.700
 - I'm not an absolute no, okay?

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.720
 So, scholasticism was this very important new wave thing,

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.100
 which was using logic and reason and debate

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.640
 to justify religious arguments

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.840
 instead of just monasticism

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.600
 where you bought everything you read in the Bible

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.640
 without questioning it.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.220
 Anyway, the reason I raise it is

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.180
 'cause the most famous scholastic

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.600
 is one of my favorite people, who's Peter Abelard,

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.880
 who was the guy who was inspired by Anselm,

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.700
 and he was the leading philosopher of the 12th century,

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.420
 really arrogant, bit of a pain,

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.400
 argued with his teachers all the time,

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.280
 totally uninterested in women

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.400
 'cause all about his study,

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.480
 and then suddenly decided he really wanted

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.320
 to be the best juicer on the face of the earth.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.160
 So, fell in love with this woman called Eloise,

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.120
 and shagged her in the convent kitchen

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.200
 and in her uncle's bedroom, and then he married her,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.040
 but he also wanted to get a religious post,

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.760
 so he married her in secret,

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.460
 and her uncle thought that he'd refused to marry her.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.380
 There was all a bit of a misunderstanding,

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.140
 and her uncle did what any good uncle would do

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.900
 and sent some men round to chop his bulls off,

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:09.740
 and so--

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.180
 - And they're now hanging in the penis museum in Iceland.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.380
 - Here we go, leave it alone, Anna!

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.220
 He missed the episode, get over it!

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.800
 (all laughing)

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.540
 - Sorry, Anna. - I'm perfectly preserved.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.300
 - This is why you like St. Anselm.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.420
 - Because he was an excuse for me to delve back

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:30.560
 into our vlog, my favourite person of the 12th century.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.640
 I just love that you've got your testicles chopped off

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.960
 over a misunderstanding.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.800
 - That's terrible.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.020
 - Yeah, St. Anselm's father was called Gandalf.

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.280
 - No, no, no. - No, stop it, yeah.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.480
 Gandalf. - No.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.640
 - I guess we only think that's funny,

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.840
 'cause Tolkien then went on to use the name,

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.720
 'cause presumably, but that is hilarious.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.360
 - Yeah, yeah, hands up, that's why I find that funny.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.940
 (all laughing)

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:56.040
 I'm not gonna hide it.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.200
 Gandalf, ironically though, loved his ceremonial star.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.040
 - That's true.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.480
 - Whereas Anselm, of course, not a fan.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.320
 - That's true.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.180
 - Anselm once was in church with Henry I,

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:11.340
 and he issued the decree of excommunication

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.740
 against people who had long hair,

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:17.420
 because long curly hair had become fashionable in court,

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.700
 and he did a sermon that was so convincing

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.700
 that several of the people with long hair in the church

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.380
 burst into tears and pulled out their hair

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:30.380
 by its roots, and the king also started crying,

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:34.040
 and one of his assistants had a pair of scissors

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.140
 and chopped off the king's hair there and then.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.540
 - Wow, that's convincing, that's good rhetoric.

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.180
 - That is.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:46.360
 - So just on these sort of medieval strange elections

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.760
 that happened, and sort of the strangeness of their structure,

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.360
 and how, you know, have you guys heard about the elections

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.320
 in the Venetian Republic?

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.160
 - No.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:56.980
 - Oh, no.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:01.980
 - Okay, so medieval Venice was led by the doge, DOGE,

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:06.860
 and the doge was elected by the great council of Venice, okay?

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.100
 This is a huge council, had lots and lots of members,

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.500
 and it was run by a few noble families,

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.260
 but it had, you know, hundreds of members,

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.660
 and everyone wanted to be the doge,

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:15.820
 obviously very powerful,

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.260
 but the system was designed very carefully

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.140
 to stop anyone gaining and keeping power, okay?

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.900
 So you had to stop people consolidating their authority

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.960
 once they were elected doge, you know?

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.680
 So it sort of keeps things in balance.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.520
 So this is how they elected a doge, right?

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:34.040
 You pick 30 members of the great council at random, okay?

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.640
 Then you pick nine of those 30, also at random, okay?

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.440
 You're trying to pick the electing body here.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.960
 You've got nine people.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.240
 - How are you picking them at random?

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.680
 You're just sort of throwing a bouquet or something.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.920
 - Names out of a hat, yeah.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.880
 - Those nine members, they then select 40 more members, right?

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.260
 Then of those 40, 12 are randomly picked.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.220
 Those 12 choose 25 more,

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.860
 who are randomly cut down to nine, okay?

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.220
 Those nine then choose another 45,

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.780
 of whom 11 are picked at random.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.620
 And then those 11 choose 41 more.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.920
 Those 41 then vote for the doge.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:13.100
 - Wow. - Exactly.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:13.940
 - And can I ask,

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.740
 what proportion was done by postal voting?

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.780
 'Cause if there's any more than 10,

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.300
 I don't believe a word of it.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:24.260
 - I, just reading into some of these mad elections,

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.260
 there was that classic one of

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.100
 after Pope Clement IV died.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.100
 They spent three years trying to decide

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.260
 on who the new Pope was.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.340
 And it took so long that eventually

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.900
 the citizens of the area got so angry, so pissed off,

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.960
 they locked all of the people voting into a church,

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.500
 and they refused to feed them anything.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:45.780
 So they're just like, get in there,

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.900
 decide on this, no food, no water,

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.900
 and they even ripped off the roof of the church

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.340
 so that the elements could rain on them and so on,

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.740
 just until they had that decision.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.140
 And they finally did get that decision.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.620
 Pope Gregory X.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.580
 - We should say that that instance that you're describing

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.980
 is the reason that paper elections and conclaves

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.340
 happen as they do today, right?

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.900
 Conclave means with keys.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.140
 And that goes back to that time

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.100
 where they had to lock them in the bloody church.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.980
 - So the new rule said that after three days of voting,

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:16.020
 you then, you only get one meal per day from then on.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.220
 Then after eight days, you only get bread and water,

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.980
 plus a little wine, apparently, just softened it.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:26.380
 But the next two popes were elected under those rules.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.860
 And amazingly, they both took under 10 days to decide

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.660
 because the food rules have been changed, that was it.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.660
 - But then in 1292, it took two years again to get a pope.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.500
 - Yeah, the rules fell apart again.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.420
 - They all, yeah. - So they instituted

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.060
 the rules and then they stopped obeying them

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.500
 for quite a long time. - Yeah, and then that time,

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.820
 they only elected a pope because a pissed off hermit

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.940
 wrote into them, warning them of divine vengeance

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.220
 that if they didn't elect the pope,

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.500
 and when his letter came in,

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.020
 one of the brothers who picked it up went,

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.500
 "Well, let's just make this guy the pope."

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.620
 And they did, not the hermit.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.060
 - Yeah, he tried to run away, didn't he?

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.740
 He genuinely didn't want to.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.540
 I think he was legit, Pietro Damoroni, who was,

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.180
 yeah, he wrote to them being like, decide, they picked him.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.700
 He tried to flee, they stopped him,

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.180
 they forced him to go into power.

00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:14.060
 And only one edict that he passed

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.700
 when he was in power as pope remained in force.

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:17.980
 And that was the edict he passed

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:19.620
 that was the right for a pope to abdicate,

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.420
 which he did within five months.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.260
 - Yeah.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:26.540
 - Sometimes you can protest too much.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.180
 In the 1190s, in very St. Edmunds,

00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:31.700
 they were looking for a new abbot.

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.100
 And there was a few different candidates,

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.500
 but of course they were all,

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.340
 "Oh no, I don't want it, I don't want it."

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.380
 But then one of them was really loudly and annoyingly saying,

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:43.860
 "No, I don't want it, anyone, don't vote for me."

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.100
 "Whatever you do, don't vote for me."

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.700
 And everyone thought that really,

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.100
 he was actually campaigning

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.740
 'cause he was like shouting a lot

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.660
 and like making himself seen.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.300
 And everyone thought that really,

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.900
 he was taking the piss a little bit.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.740
 And then he was killed by a collapsing beam,

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.780
 which all the other priests saw as a sign from God,

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.380
 but yep, he was definitely,

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.220
 he was definitely taking the piss.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.700
 - Did all the other priests have to bury the chainsaws

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.700
 that they brought to that meeting very quickly?

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.180
 - I would love it if political campaigns

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.540
 the day just involved the politicians

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.300
 all insisting loudly they didn't want it.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.660
 - It would be fun.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.700
 - It would be fun.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.220
 - If they were trying to force your hand

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.820
 onto the Bible at the inauguration

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.500
 and he was saying, "No, I don't want, no,

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.980
 I'm not touching it, no."

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.980
 (laughing)

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.260
 - Used to be like that in America.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.500
 So when Horace Greeley ran against

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.740
 Ulysses S. Grant in 1872,

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.700
 he was the first one who went across a whole country,

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.380
 kind of canvassing for votes.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:40.940
 And all Grant's team, they just mocked him for it.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.780
 And they said, "Look, this is just,

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:43.900
 I can't believe what you're doing.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.100
 This is not the right way to want to become president.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.020
 If you want a president who is a humble man,

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.780
 we don't want someone who's shouting

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.740
 from the rooftops that I'm the best."

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:53.980
 - God, that's interesting.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:54.820
 And when was that?

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.860
 That was kind of 1880 odd or?

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.260
 - 1872, yeah.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.060
 - Sorry, okay, yeah.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.860
 - And actually it's still the rule in America really,

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.260
 or it's supposed to be that if you're going to be

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.540
 the running mate of a potential president,

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.300
 then you're not supposed to campaign for that.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.020
 And that's now you're not supposed to do that.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:15.580
 So whenever, yeah, when Joe Biden was looking

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.940
 for his running mate and he said,

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.340
 "I'm definitely going to have a woman.

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.180
 We don't know who it is yet,

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:20.460
 but I'll definitely be a woman."

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.860
 Obviously all of the journalists would ask

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.100
 all of the main probable candidates,

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.300
 would you be up for it?

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.260
 And a couple of them said,

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.500
 "Yeah, I'd definitely be up for it."

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.300
 And then a lot of the commentators in America said,

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.300
 "Well, that's not really on.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.460
 You're not really supposed to do that.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.300
 You're supposed to say,

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.580
 "Well, if it comes my way, I'll see what happens,

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.620
 but I'm really, I'm concentrating on campaigning

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.020
 for the president and stuff like that."

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.340
 - I guess that still happens, doesn't it?

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.020
 Like in British politics,

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.860
 they say, "Do you want to be prime minister?"

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.140
 And they say, "No, I'm doing the job."

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.420
 - That's what Rishi Sunak says every week, isn't it?

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.260
 - Yeah.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.100
 (all laughing)

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.380
 - It's so transparent.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.300
 I wonder if it was as grotesquely transparent

00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.500
 as this in the olden days,

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.580
 when even the nice ones, you know, AOC and people,

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.300
 no, it wouldn't cross my mind, be president.

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.740
 No, I don't, I just, I'm just here for the people,

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:07.740
 for the do good thing.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:08.980
 I wish someone would just say,

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.420
 the only reason I'm in this job

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.100
 is to achieve ultimate power.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.940
 (all laughing)

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.020
 - I've just got one more thing

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.860
 about electoral malpractice.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.220
 This is actually a recent story,

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.700
 got sent to me on Twitter by Kata Ovary.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.340
 So thank you to you.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.020
 This is about the New Zealand Bird of the Year competition,

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.980
 which has identified 1500 fraudulent votes.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.900
 So there has been voter fraud in one election this year.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.300
 - Can I just ask,

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.220
 how often in the New Zealand Bird of the Year

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.460
 the competition does the Kiwi not win?

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.820
 'Cause it feels like-

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.940
 - I had no idea, the field is wide open.

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:44.780
 - Really? - It's amazing.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.540
 Yeah, I mean, in this case,

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:47.540
 there was a lot of tampering

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.620
 on behalf of the little spotted Kiwi,

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.060
 which got 1500 fraudulent votes,

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.580
 got pushed to the top of the leaderboard,

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.780
 they've been removed, but no, it's wide open.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.700
 So, and this is not the first time

00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.780
 this election has been tampered with.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.700
 So there's a whole report about this in Vice,

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.740
 which said this, in 2015,

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.780
 two teenage girls tried to rig the results

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.620
 in favour of the cock-a-co.

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.780
 In 2017, a number of fake email accounts were created

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.340
 to boost the polls in favour of the white-faced Heron.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.900
 And in 2018, someone voted for the shag

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.940
 more than 3,000 times.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.100
 (all laughing)

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.460
 - I didn't even know Boris Johnson was in New Zealand.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.580
 (all laughing)

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.500
 - That's the same guy Googling Shinga,

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.820
 the British New Zealand West, I don't know.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.400
 (upbeat music)

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.660
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:38.900
 And that is my fact.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.300
 My fact this week is that the reason America

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:45.140
 has a national anthem is down to Robert Ripley,

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.540
 believe it or not.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.260
 - Mm, that's very clever wording,

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.980
 'cause who's gonna think we'll believe it or not?

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.180
 - I felt yucky saying that, it looked fine on the page.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.820
 When it came out of my mouth, that was a bit weird.

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:59.300
 So, Robert Ripley, the creator of the very famous

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.880
 Believe It or Not series of books and museums

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:06.880
 around the world, wrote in 1929 that the star-spangled banner

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.420
 had never actually formally been adopted by America

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.460
 as the national anthem.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.940
 It was used in lots of ceremonies,

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.120
 it was done everywhere, and he got a lot of angry mail

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.860
 from that saying, "How dare you say that?"

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.020
 Until it was realized that actually constitutionally,

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.480
 it wasn't officially their anthem.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.540
 So, five million people signed a petition

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.320
 that was forwarded onto Congress.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:31.060
 And eventually in 1931, President Hoover signed a law

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.000
 to say this is officially recognized now.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.060
 So, yeah, it's down to Ripley.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.960
 - Amazing. - Thank you, Ripley.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.520
 - Just thanks to Ripley, interestingly.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.640
 So, it had to be proposed that law by a representative.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.280
 And it was the man who proposed that was called John Lindtikum.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.400
 And he represented parts of Baltimore,

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.480
 which is what this song is about, isn't it?

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.240
 It's about a fort, Fort McHenry in Baltimore.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.880
 So, get this, Lindtikum himself, the politician,

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.540
 his first wife was a woman called Eugenia Mae Biden,

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.660
 who appears from what I can tell

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.660
 to be a relative of Joe Biden, distant relative.

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.420
 - No way. - No way.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:10.900
 - Yeah, I don't know about a distant relative.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.060
 I mean, he is quite old,

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.420
 so she might just be his older sister or something.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.460
 (all laughing)

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.740
 But yeah, that's amazing.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.780
 - He should have made more of that in his campaign.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.300
 He might have actually clinched the bloody election properly.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.860
 He emphasizes connections to the national anthem.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.120
 - Okay, Donald Jr.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.320
 (all laughing)

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.920
 - It was actually signed as the national anthem

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.320
 in an executive order by Woodrow Wilson

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.320
 about 20 years earlier, wasn't it?

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.920
 But it hadn't been properly rubber stamped by Congress.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.360
 And it was in 1931 that they rubber stamped it.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.800
 So, it was kind of a half law when Ripley did this

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:52.400
 and then it became a full, straight on law in 1931.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.680
 - Yeah, and his piece that he did,

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.940
 so this was, he used to do illustrations

00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.860
 that would sort of have little bits of writing

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.300
 around it to tell you this fact.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.460
 And in his original illustration,

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.420
 it was a bit controversial,

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.740
 the wording that he used for it,

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.580
 because he said, "America has no national anthem."

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:10.340
 So that was his big headline statement.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.180
 Then he said, "The USA, brackets being a dry country,"

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.220
 'cause of course prohibition at the time,

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.620
 "has been using, without authorization,

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.940
 "a vulgar old English drinking song."

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.920
 So, he was sort of doubling down on not only is it not our song,

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:28.140
 but it's completely against what our government stands for

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.820
 at the moment, pencil the sort of outrage.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:33.420
 - But wait, so then he petitioned to have the vulgar old

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.920
 English drinking song actually formally institutes.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.940
 - No, that was separate to him.

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.680
 He just, this was him putting out a fact.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.440
 This was people randomly realizing we need to petition.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.260
 He didn't push that at all.

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.760
 - But then they did adopt the drinking song,

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.760
 of course, didn't they?

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.880
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.100
 - Because the Star Spangled Banner,

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:54.200
 the tune came from a society in the London Dintic

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.740
 called the Anacriotic Society,

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.840
 which was like a drinking club on the Strand

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.800
 and in various parts of London.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.120
 And you would go down and you would drink

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.440
 and you would sing this song.

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.880
 - It sort of sounded like an 18th century

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.720
 Bullingdon Club a little bit, didn't it?

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.560
 - Yeah.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.480
 - A gentleman hanging out drinking,

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.960
 except for actually not as fun,

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.480
 because they met once a month.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.360
 And it was fun on the one hand,

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.440
 but it did start with a three hour long instrumental concert

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.040
 to have your supper.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.080
 - No.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.680
 - Yeah, they dropped that.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.400
 - And then it only lasted a few years.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.000
 It came to an end when the Duchess of Devonshire

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 attended one of the meetings.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.240
 And then they started singing some of these

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.200
 quite ribald songs.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.040
 And she was not very happy about it at all.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.840
 And it wasn't just that she wasn't very happy.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.680
 It was that the people singing them felt

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.720
 that they couldn't really sing these rude songs

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.040
 in front of a lady.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:47.040
 And so they slowly stopped singing them.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.200
 And then resigned one after another that same night.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.600
 And just all went, no, no, actually,

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.880
 I'm not doing this anymore.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.200
 And one after another, they all left until

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.640
 there was only a couple of people left

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.280
 and the Duchess of Devonshire.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.120
 And the Duchess of--

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:01.960
 - What a buzz kill.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.040
 - I know, I know.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.840
 I mean, the thing is that she really wasn't a buzz kill.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.800
 Like Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire,

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.000
 she was the great, great, great, great aunt

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.080
 of Diana Princess of Wales.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.600
 And she was really famous for being kind of a bit out there

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.600
 as far as Duchesses were concerned.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.040
 She was always drinking, she was gambling.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.240
 She got in real trouble in the election in 1974

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.240
 because of claims that she was trading kisses for votes.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.080
 - Oh, really?

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.280
 - Guy Fox, yeah. - Not 1974, presumably.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.560
 1774?

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.360
 - Well, weirdly, it's 1784.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.400
 So I'm not sure.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.120
 I got the one in the far right in that.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.240
 - That's all that matters.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.640
 - But yeah, apparently she said

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.200
 that she would kiss a particular butcher

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.840
 if he voted for this Guy Fox.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.400
 And then supporters of William Pitt said,

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.040
 well, that is just basically a kins of prostitution.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.160
 So this is gonna be a massive scandal

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.640
 and it became a massive scandal.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.160
 Although it seems when we look at it now

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.040
 from the future, it looks like perhaps it wasn't even her

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.360
 who was saying this, it might have been her sister.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.000
 - Wait, was her sister saying, I will kiss the butcher?

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.800
 Or was she saying, I'll get my sister,

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.160
 the Duchess of Devonshire to kiss you, Mr Butcher?

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.720
 - What I believe happened is the sister said,

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.960
 I'll kiss the butcher if you vote for Fox.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.120
 And the papers thought it was the Duchess of Devonshire

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:22.960
 who'd done this.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.480
 - Oh, so the sister was like the dodgy relative

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.320
 who's dragging down a proper political campaign.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.200
 - Kind of, yeah.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.840
 Although really it was just an excuse

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.920
 for the Pitt team to just, you know.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.360
 - Yeah, it's such an ineffective method

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.920
 of winning an election as well.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.520
 If you have to transport someone around the country,

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.600
 kissing everyone, every butcher, yeah.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.480
 - Did this poor butcher end up getting a kiss for God's sake

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.720
 from the Duchess or her sister?

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:47.760
 That's what I wanna know.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.880
 Everyone forgets about the butcher in this story.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.960
 - The butcher did, the butcher got a kiss.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.600
 - Thank God. - And I think that was,

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.880
 if she had just said, I might give you a kiss if you vote,

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.320
 then it might not have been so bad,

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.640
 but it was the fact that she did the kiss

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.640
 and then he voted.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.240
 So they were like, yeah, that's bang on prostitution.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.480
 - She was, she was a cool dude though.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.360
 It must have been a really bad song for it to put her off.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.200
 I think if you were ashamed to sing a song in front

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.040
 of the Duchess, then actually,

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.720
 you shouldn't have been singing the song in the first place.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.080
 - Yeah, but it's very hard, isn't it,

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.440
 to sing the star-spangled banner.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.680
 So I've never actually had a crack at it,

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.920
 but apparently it's got 19 semitones in it

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.440
 and it's just such an inappropriate song

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.240
 for almost everybody's vocal range.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.920
 And mostly when you're watching someone sing it,

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.720
 you're just thinking, are they gonna hit the high note

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.880
 or not?

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:32.720
 - Yeah.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.560
 - I was written by a guy called John Stafford Smith

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.440
 when he was still a teenager.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.240
 He was a lay vicar of Westminster

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.400
 and he died at the age of 85

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.480
 from a grape pip lodged in his windpipe.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.320
 - No.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.160
 - Well, can I say something about this?

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.080
 - Yeah.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.800
 - I wasted a day, I think, trying to track this down.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.960
 So John Stafford Smith, who incidentally never claimed

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:56.880
 that he'd written the anthem,

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.280
 refused to acknowledge he'd written it,

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.160
 even though everyone in the society was like,

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.800
 yeah mate, you wrote this.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.800
 Now, there's like various books say that the way he died

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:09.960
 was aged 85 or 86, from a grape pip lodged in his throat.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.640
 But the society, the Anachronian society,

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.320
 was named after this ancient Greek poet, Anachron,

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:19.560
 sixth century BC poet, who also, according to Pliny the Elder,

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:23.840
 died from choking on a grape pip at the age of 85 or 86.

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:27.600
 Now, this is too much of a coincidence to be possible.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.440
 - No, come on.

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.040
 - Someone has cocked up those sources.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.080
 - You're too skeptical.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.840
 It's definitely, you know, they're both famous drinkers.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:35.880
 They drank wine.

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.240
 What's wine made out of?

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.080
 Great.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.440
 - It was one of the leading causes of death

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.720
 for the over 80s, quite recently.

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.480
 - For about 3,000 years, wasn't it?

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.800
 It was, it was.

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.880
 Back in the days when you still had pips in the wine,

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:53.000
 it's nice that we get pitted wine now, isn't it?

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.920
 - So the old vicar, sorry,

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.560
 he's the one who wrote the original,

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.160
 did he write the original lyrics?

00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.200
 Or did he write the tune?

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.520
 - He wrote the tune. - No, the tune.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:01.720
 - Sorry, oh yeah.

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.400
 So when I was talking about the semitones thing,

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.320
 that's about the modern song.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.480
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:11.800
 So that was written by a guy called Francis Scott Key.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.080
 And he was 35 years old at the time

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:18.360
 when he was on a British ship in the Baltimore Harbor

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.160
 and there was the bombing of Fort McHenry.

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:24.320
 And he was watching as all the bombs went down and so on.

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.880
 And it was in the dawn's early light

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.960
 that he saw this massive flag,

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.240
 the stars and stripes still flying there

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.920
 from this vantage point on the boat.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.640
 And he just found it so amazing

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:37.240
 that he wrote down these lyrics for not that song

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.600
 just as a poem and it got published in a paper

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.120
 and it got adapted then by someone else

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.600
 into that song that we now have.

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.080
 - Seriously weird moment for him

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.960
 because the way it happened was he,

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:51.200
 the war of 1812 was happening in 1814, as it did.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.880
 And he boarded a British ship

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.920
 to try and negotiate the release of this doctor guy

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.760
 who was a good guy,

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.680
 who treated lots of British soldiers very well.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.320
 So he boarded this British ship,

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.240
 said, "Look, give us our doctor back, he's a nice man."

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:05.400
 And the British guy on the ship,

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.960
 the British general, British Admiral said,

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.000
 "Yeah, absolutely, you have the doctor.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.520
 "Would you mind just waiting a day

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.800
 "because we are about to bomb the absolute shit

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.320
 "out of this harbor right in front of us?"

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.840
 And so he then has to sit on the ship

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:23.800
 while all the Brits on there sort of flatten his homeland.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.520
 And then, yeah, I guess what else can he do

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.960
 except write this poem.

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.280
 But the fun thing about it is the flag,

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.800
 probably wasn't actually the same flag

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.160
 that was flying the next morning.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.880
 This is according to the History Channel.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.960
 - No. - So when it's like,

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.560
 you know, for just a second,

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.360
 you see by the dawn's early light,

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.920
 the flag that you're looking at

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.680
 is actually a new flag they erected that morning

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:49.360
 because the actual flag was so massive

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.720
 and it was pouring with rain the night of the battle.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.400
 It would have been wet and it would have weighed 500 pounds,

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.240
 well, then 500 pounds,

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.000
 which would have snapped the flagpole.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.680
 So actually they had to do a replacement mini flag

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.160
 while the battle was going on.

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:07.160
 And then overnight, the flag erectors got the massive flag back

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.440
 and hauled it up the flagpole.

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.640
 And so in the morning,

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.680
 it was the replaced large flag that he was looking at.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.200
 So it hadn't even stayed there during the battle.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.600
 It's a full song, guys.

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.320
 - This show hasn't even gone out yet.

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.920
 And already I can hear the fury

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.120
 of the Americans listening to this episode.

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.280
 I just hear it in my ears.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.720
 Let's get to get us right there.

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.280
 - Shall we talk about Ripley instead,

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.560
 who's a great American?

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.400
 - Yeah.

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.520
 - So yeah, Ripley, believe it or not,

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.240
 started as a cartoonist, had a bit of spare time

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:43.080
 and so drew some cartoons of crazy things

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.240
 that athletes had done.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.760
 And that became really, really popular.

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.240
 And so the next year he did another one.

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.440
 And then a few years later,

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:49.840
 he started doing more and more and more

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.400
 of these amazing, unbelievable feats

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.920
 that people had done and illustrating them himself.

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.880
 And then eventually that became, believe it or not.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.160
 - He's basically a one-man QI, it's so interesting.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.240
 And he loved doing the thing that QI loves to do,

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.280
 which is to debunk commonly accepted truths,

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.720
 hence the national anthem thing.

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:11.840
 But the brilliant thing about him was how much post he got,

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.640
 'cause he was known as Rip, Robert Ripley.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.040
 And people would write to him in a series

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:17.920
 of elaborate codes.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.800
 So they would write his address backwards

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.960
 or upside down or in Braille,

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.920
 or they'd draw it on in semaphore flags.

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.720
 Some people apparently would put a very slight tear

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:31.520
 in the letter, right, i.e. a small rip.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.240
 And they would then post that and see if it got to him.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.920
 Anyway, this became so popular

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:38.040
 that the US Postmaster General had to announce

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:41.920
 that the Postal Service would no longer be deciphering codes

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:42.760
 for people.

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.440
 They said, "No, stop all this bullshit.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:47.960
 "We just write the address on like normal people."

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:50.040
 - But he was so famous that they tended to know

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:50.880
 to send it to him.

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.300
 - Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.600
 - Although I do imagine if that ripping is true,

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.480
 that was he also getting loads of letters

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.440
 that were loving letters of daughters to mothers,

00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:00.880
 which had accidentally got a bit ripped in the post.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:01.720
 - Problems.

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.680
 - Must be one for Rob.

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.720
 - And also whenever anyone sent like some flowers

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.640
 saying RIP on them, did he get all those as well?

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.160
 - Yeah, he thought he was much more loved

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.240
 than he actually was.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:15.680
 - You say he was a one-man QI.

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.280
 I think he sort of was, James.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.800
 The life he lived was essentially

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.160
 traveling around the world,

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.360
 but not going to the normal places most of us travel,

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:25.080
 going to the really weirdo places.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.400
 So he could come back and talk about the weird shit he'd seen.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.200
 He went to Norway. - Was that a compliment?

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.560
 'Cause I'm not sure it was.

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:34.080
 - I think it is.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.080
 - It kind of felt like a compliment

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.840
 until the word weirdo came in.

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.600
 And then I wasn't sure.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.920
 - It's a QI compliment.

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.280
 I'm gonna leave you to take it as you see fit.

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:45.520
 He went to Norway and immediately visited

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.800
 a place called Hel, which is a tiny Norwegian village,

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:48.840
 just for the sake of coming back

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.280
 and saying he'd been to hell.

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.080
 And he went around finding,

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.720
 I guess people who before the internet existed

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:58.680
 would have been complete extraordinary people,

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.760
 just people from different cultures,

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.560
 from different tribes, and then reporting on them.

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.480
 And no one believed him.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.360
 It was like, "QI, every time he announced something,

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.280
 everyone refused to believe him, didn't they?"

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:12.160
 - He announced some pretty fruity stuff, in my opinion.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.000
 - Oh yeah.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.040
 - Yeah, I mean, he claimed things like,

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:19.920
 "A Frenchman once drank 13 pints of wine in one breath."

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.840
 And you think, "Hmm..."

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.920
 - Did he? - Okay.

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.320
 - Well, believe it or not.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.680
 - The tragic thing was,

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.040
 the tragic thing about that was

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.400
 that there was a single pit, a great pit,

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.920
 right at the end of the party time.

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.160
 He would have done 40.

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:37.360
 - Okay, that's it.

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.400
 That is all of our facts.

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.760

 We'll see you then.

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:14.880
 Goodbye.
