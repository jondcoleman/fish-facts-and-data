00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.960
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.560
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.760
 Anna Tyshinski and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.240
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.680
 Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.880
 My fact is that for years scientists thought Starfish had no heads.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.080
 It now turns out they have no bodies.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 [Laughter]

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.080
 Wow.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.080
 All head.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.760
 Or even the arms heads, no.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.760
 Yeah.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.920
 I think what this shows is that it's actually quite hard to describe Starfish in terms of

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.920
 human anatomy.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920
 Yeah.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.920
 [Laughter]

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.720
 So what's the difference between head and body according to this definition?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.720
 Okay.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.880
 This is the result of a new study from Stanford University and I think maybe one or two other

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.880
 places.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.560
 And it's about the genetic code that sort of programmes Starfish because Starfish are

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.600
 really, really weird bodily as in they start out with bilateral symmetry, which is what

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.160
 humans have as in you've got two sides, you've got a left and a right and it's sort of the

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.600
 same, you know, you're mirrored.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.400
 So Starfish start out like that when they're first born and then they kind of grow out

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.720
 of it and they become the starfish shape that we know.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.800
 And so what this study is, it looked at the genetic code which kind of programmes head

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.040
 like territory and it turns out that they have that in each of their arms and the middle,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.320
 the middle bit, which joins all the arms together, has more head like genetics.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.120
 Not one bit of the starfish contains the genetic programme which we associate in our

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.280
 own bodies with a trunk or a torso.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.960
 Are they one entity or the arms, mini heads?

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 Okay.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.960
 So it's not like one big orbiting head?

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.680
 It's a bit like that.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.000
 Like we used to think it was imagine your body, but then we cut off your head and so you're

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.560
 just the middle with some arms and legs sticking out.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.960
 But now what it turns out is imagine someone took off your arms and legs and super glued

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.960
 them to your head.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.960
 That's it.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.840
 Although, I read, and I don't know if this is one of the guys involved in the study,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.600
 a biologist called Thurston Lakali, which is just a really cool name.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.920
 He said we should be thinking of them as a disembodied head walking about the sea floor

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.680
 on its lips.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.520
 So are you saying the legs are the lips?

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.520
 Legs.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.000
 Well, yeah, kind of, except that also Dan, in this example where we've removed your arms

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.800
 and legs, we've also super glued your anus to the back of your head.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.720
 So yes, you are walking out of your mouth too.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.520
 Dan, you're becoming more and more attractive by the minute.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.360
 Please fan art, send to Andy.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.760
 Basically, what the main headline is is that there's no way for a starfish to sing the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.840
 song head, shoulders, knees and toes.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.200
 There's just no analogy for that.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.960
 That's his head, head, head, lips, feet.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.960
 Anus.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.960
 Anus.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.760
 Anus, head, head, lips and feet.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760
 Lips and feet.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.760
 Amazing.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.760
 That's incredible.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.640
 Is this why they have that feature that I think we must have mentioned before, where

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.400
 even if you cut off the main circular bit that looks like a body to us and just are

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.680
 left with a leg, they can regrow and regenerate their entire self from just a leg.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.080
 Maybe is that related to the fact that each leg actually has this genetic head material

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.360
 in it that can sprout everything.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.360
 Yeah.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.360
 And you.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.360
 But it's a cool thing to be able to do anyway.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.480
 Imagine someone just cutting all of your body off except your finger and then your finger

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.760
 grow a whole new body on it.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.760
 It's mental.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.760
 It's absolutely crackers.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.920
 The regeneration thing is insane because as you say, like a tiniest bit can be chopped

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.000
 off and they can grow into a whole new starfish and that's really messed up a lot of fishermen

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 back in the day.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.440
 So there's areas of the world where they would eat the local oyster population.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.500
 This is the starfish and they were depleting it.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.400
 So what fishermen used to do is when they got a starfish out, they'd kill it and they'd

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.960
 kill it by slashing it into two or five or whatever and then just chucking them back into

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.120
 the ocean, not realizing they were creating a giant army of starfish.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.840
 Like what I imagine the gremlins were if I ever watched that movie.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.080
 Is that what happens?

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.440
 You put water on them and they all double in.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.680
 Is that what happens when they multiply?

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.680
 I can't remember.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.680
 I haven't seen it.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.680
 Guys, what are you?

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.680
 What are you?

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.680
 Yeah, of course.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.680
 Dan, I'm really disappointed in you.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.680
 Sorry.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.840
 Do the gremlins get chopped up into smaller pieces and then create more gremlins?

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.240
 If you put water on them, they multiply.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.800
 If you feed them after midnight, they become evil.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.920
 If you expose them to sunlight, they die.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.880
 How many anuses do they have?

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.280
 That is very vexed doctrine.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.920
 There is a big debate among us gremlin heads.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.160
 There's an amazing thing that they do as well when they're eating.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.640
 Starfish will basically send their stomach to go and get the meal.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.360
 So say if they're eating something like there's a thing called the sand dollar, which is quite

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.120
 a flat little species and you find it on the floor of the ocean, they'll send their stomach

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.520
 out, they'll surround it and they'll melt down the body of it into the food, bring it

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.840
 back in and just leave the skeleton.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.840
 You know what?

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.440
 If we did that, then probably the job of delivering a screwdriver would be quite bad.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.560
 My delivery screwdriver is don't stick around and watch me eat my meal.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.240
 Yeah, but you'll have to because instead of you coming to the door, your stomach would

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.680
 come to the door and when they handed you the food, your stomach would kind of envelope

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.360
 around the bag of Chinese takeaway.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.480
 Leaving only the plastic Tupperware behind.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.560
 I can't believe yours don't watch you eat Anna.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.280
 Maybe I'm tipping generously enough that they do, but they always stick around through

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280
 the letterbox.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.080
 What interesting thing about this stomach inside out thing is that you know oxytocin,

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.560
 they call it the love chemical.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.200
 Very important in childbirth, it's like what stimulates a lot of changes in the body when

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.320
 you have a baby and stuff like that.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.200
 I think I want to go on about it, don't they?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.280
 Oh my God, lights and scented candles, play some music, oh that'll get your oxytocin

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.280
 going.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.080
 Literally, if you ever go to one of those things where they teach you how to be a parent, if

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.200
 they ask you any question, just say oxytocin and that is always the answer, doesn't matter

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200
 what it is.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.920
 But anyway, not if you're a starfish.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.160
 If you're a starfish, oxytocin makes your stomach go inside out.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.080
 So it's in starfish world, it's known as the stomach inside out hormone, not the love

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.240
 hormone.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.640
 And they go to special lessons, don't they, about how to eat their first meal and it's

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.840
 well, lighter scented candle, difficult underwater, but you can do it.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.400
 So it's good for, as in it's not in a bad way, as in it's not bad for them.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.400
 Yeah, it's good.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.240
 It's the chemical which they release when they're hungry so that it kind of sets into

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.080
 motion this thing that Dan described.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.840
 And so we kind of use it for something different?

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.000
 Yeah, we use it to feel love.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.600
 Yeah, to make changes in the body to help you to procreate.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.600
 Yeah.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.600
 Okay, I'm seeing the difference in romantic stuff that you two say to your partners.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.040
 Andy says, "I love you."

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.120
 And James says, "I'm having changes in my body that are helping me to procreate towards

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.120
 you right now."

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.880
 Can we say what some starfish do in exactly this?

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.880
 Now we're kind of on their love life.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.200
 Have you heard of pseudo-copulation?

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.200
 Pseudo-copulation.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.200
 Have I?

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.760
 That's all the copulation that I've ever done.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.880
 I'm so glad we've reached, like, 70s comedian.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.680
 It actually is quite like that because normally, or loads of species of starfish operacy, there

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.640
 are dozens and dozens, normally they release sperm and eggs near each other and they then

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.840
 meet up and you know, there's no sex as we understand it at all, but pseudo-copulation

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.840
 is kind of similar.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.480
 So a male and a female, they form a pair and the male, quite sweetness, puts all his

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.840
 arms between the female's arms so they're kind of cuddled and then she releases eggs

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.280
 right there and he simultaneously releases all his sperm.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.680
 So it's like a very intense cuddle, basically.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.680
 Oh, okay.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.680
 That's nice.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.000
 Did you say that's how a particular species does it, sorry?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.080
 It's how some species do it, yeah, not all of them.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.960
 Do you guys happen to know, I'm only thinking of this because Andy's brought this up, but

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.920
 if you chop a starfish in half and it regenerates into a new starfish, does it carry the same

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.060
 age or does it start fresh?

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.680
 Because you know, they can live up to like 35 years roughly.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.360
 I think they can start fresh because for some of them, that's actually how they procreate

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.560
 is just by dividing, even more sexless.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.560
 That's what I mean.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.520
 They don't need copulation really, they just lob an arm off and they're good.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.440
 Well, they don't necessarily need it, but it's good for genetic diversity copulation.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.240
 That's why I always say to my wife, so this will be good for the genetic diversity of our

00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.040
 species darling.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.040
 Oh, Valentine's Day for Mark and Elsa.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.840
 There are some very cool versions.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.000
 I think I really like the cushion starfish because it's not actually star shaped.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.360
 If you look at it, it's like it forgot to sprout its lips/legs, it's just a pentagon

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.360
 really.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.360
 And when it's young, it starts out as a pentagon and it just gets bigger and bigger and then

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.720
 it ends up as a big blob, like a cushion.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.720
 That's nice.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720
 And it's quite nice.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.560
 There are about 2,000 of them, 2,000 species and we're in dangerous times.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:35.360
 So back in episode 45, James mentioned a thing which was the starfish wasting syndrome,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.720
 which is this really horrible disease that has just been sweeping through the oceans and

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.760
 within hours of a starfish getting this disease, they are dying and they're dying in really

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.760
 weird ways.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.360
 So as James mentioned, one of the arms sort of dislodges itself and just walks off into

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.560
 the distance.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.160
 So they keep finding these arms everywhere, just laying on the seabed and then a completely

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:00.320
 gooey, yucky starfish that's just been eaten by this disease.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.640
 And we are losing billions at a time at the moment.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.600
 It's so huge, it's so bad.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.000
 And as far as I can tell, the leading scientists who are trying to work out what's going on

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.480
 are studying it in a tank.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.000
 And do you know where this tank is?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.400
 It's in Star City, no, it's in the Madame Tussauds.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.680
 It's in the Pentagon and it's got Pentagon starfish in it.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.680
 Very nice.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.680
 That's lovely.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.800
 How are we supposed to know that?

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.760
 It's in one of those restaurants where you go and they've got all those lobsters sort

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.000
 of sad looking and lobsters hanging around and it's in there.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 It's not that.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 I'll give you a clue.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 It's in the Mexican Aquarium where Free Willy was based.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.140
 Oh, that's great.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.400
 You were basically there.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:45.600
 It is literally in a warehouse right behind the place where Keiko was held, where Free

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.600
 Willy was held.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.600
 Holy shit.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.600
 Oh my god, that was such a good guess.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.600
 Yeah.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.600
 That's great.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.340
 Yeah, so they're studying them there and they've found a method which is kind of helping

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.800
 them but you can't get that into the oceans right now.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.800
 It's insane.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.800
 There's nothing we can do.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.800
 But what's causing it?

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.800
 Is it?

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.800
 They think it's a bacteria.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800
 Is it?

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800
 Yeah.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.800
 But they don't actually know and James mentioned this close to 10 years ago and we're still

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.800
 none the wiser.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.800
 It's ridiculous.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.480
 What's the point of me bringing these subjects to light if they're not going to do anything

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.480
 in nine years?

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.840
 Honestly, you guys, listen back to episode 45, 46, 47.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.840
 Yeah.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.040
 I was always bringing up these really important things and everyone just ignored me, like

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.040
 Cassandra.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.040
 Yeah.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.040
 It's hard to know what to do about it, isn't it?

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.920
 As you're everyday man on the street, maybe we need a free starfish, you know, Free Willy

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.920
 sequel.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:36.000
 Oh yeah, flinging it into the ocean, I don't know.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.640
 Since 2013, five billion have died from this disease and they're down population wise by

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.640
 90%.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.640
 It's mad.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.640
 Oh my goodness.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.800
 That's terrible.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.880
 You can also eat starfish.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.880
 Can you?

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.880
 Yes.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.480
 Some places in the Far East do.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.560
 There's a place called Qingdao where it's quite common that they eat starfish.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.720
 I've seen a blog of people making them and eating them.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.880
 What you do is you kind of break off the leg and then you open it up and then the meat

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.880
 is inside.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:12.080
 And it looks like, if you can imagine a baby's nappy when they've first gone on to solids,

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.480
 it looks a bit like that.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.760
 Why did you get fired as the restaurant menu description writer for this place, James?

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.760
 I don't know.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:25.320
 I thought it was a visual way of describing it and apparently the taste is the same as

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.600
 a beach smells low tide.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.600
 Right.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.600
 Wow.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.480
 They eat them in Qingdao, but to be honest, these days it's mostly a thing for tourists

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.480
 who got to Qingdao.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.600
 The locals don't really eat anymore.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.440
 If you ordered it for dinner and you ate sort of like three quarters of it and asked for it

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:47.680
 in a doggy bag, by the time you got home, would you have a full meal again?

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.840
 They leave footprints wherever they go.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.320
 So very bad criminals.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.320
 Lip prints.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.520
 Lip prints.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.520
 Sorry.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520
 Yes.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:00.360
 This was actually an interesting study that I read about on a blog called the Echino blog.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.280
 It's this guy called Christopher Ma, who calls himself the starfish guy.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:10.520
 He's written multiple entries a month on just starfish for 10 years, stopped in 2018.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:15.560
 So literally just hundreds and hundreds of entries just about starfish.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.480
 And he reported that they don't have suction cups on their feet, which is what everyone

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.480
 always says.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.480
 Yeah, right.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.480
 They stick to things by suction.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.480
 Yes.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.160
 It's actually more like glue.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.320
 So they have a fuzzy coat, what's called a fuzzy coat on each foot.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.560
 They've got hundreds and hundreds of feet on each leg.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.680
 So on each foot they've got a fuzzy coat and when that touches the ground, they push this

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.960
 kind of gluey film through it, which forms a mesh and that sticks them to the ground.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.480
 And then when they lift their leg up again, they leave the fuzzy coat behind.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.920
 And you can track a starfish across the sea floor if it's shop lifted because they leave

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.080
 these constant, every single one of their little suction things, leaves a little fuzzy

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.080
 coat behind.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.040
 And then you have to take a lip print, which is quite sexy.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.320
 You have an underground group who would do you Botox in your lips, like if you'd just

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.520
 a prime, they'd be able to hide.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.520
 Like face off.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.520
 Yeah.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.520
 It's like face off, but just with lips.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.520
 Lips off.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.520
 Yeah.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.520
 Lips off.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.520
 Oh, and is it Travolta and Nicolas Cage?

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.520
 They have to swap lips.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.520
 Just the lips.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.520
 Just the lips.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.520
 Yeah.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.000
 I think I would watch that film if it was Mick Jagger and Michael Gove.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.680
 Like you want two people with very different types of lips, don't you?

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.680
 Oh, yes.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.680
 Yeah.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.360
 And I mean, we are getting into the realm of a body swap comedy here, where Gove has

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.360
 to live as Jagger and vice versa.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.360
 Yeah.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:41.160
 It's weird, you say vice versa, because the body swap comedy genre, which includes what,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:46.720
 like, Free Free Friday, all that stuff, it began in the 19th century with a book called

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.720
 vice versa.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.720
 Oh.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.720
 First ever one.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.720
 Superb knowledge.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.260
 Father and the son who swap places.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:58.080
 And the story goes that Anthony Trollop was reading this book out to his friends, and

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.280
 he found a bit, which was so funny that he just got into a laughing fit and he died.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.280
 No.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.280
 Trollop died of laughing?

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.280
 I mean, no, he didn't really.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.280
 Let's be clear on that.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.280
 He did.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.280
 He did.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.280
 Well, he died of a stroke.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.000
 He died of a stroke, which he had due to intense laughter, and he died a few weeks later.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.640
 But I think that is true, actually.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.640
 What?

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.640
 Hold on.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.640
 He laughed intensely.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.920
 And then he had a stroke immediately, and then he died a few weeks later.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.920
 Sorry.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.480
 It wasn't like he had a stroke a few weeks later, and they went, remember, when he laughed

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.600
 a couple of months ago, but it was that.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.600
 That's a better story.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.600
 Yeah.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.600
 Yeah.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.280
 Basically, Freaky Friday killed Anthony Trollop.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.280
 Wow.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.240
 Now, that's a fact.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:44.840
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.680
 My fact this week is that one of the best times for Dracula to suck your blood is while

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.080
 you are watching a Dracula movie.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.080
 Oh.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.080
 No.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:59.560
 Is that because it's so thrilling normally to watch a Dracula movie that you'll be distracted?

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:05.160
 Or is it because you're watching the Dracula movie, then if you see Dracula in your house,

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.840
 you think, oh, that's normal because it's happening on the TV, so it's happening here

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.080
 as normal as well.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.880
 We stumbled into the confusion of the fact immediately, which is, do you mean the best

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.100
 time for Dracula or the best time for you?

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.240
 Because often what's good for a vampire is not good for the person the vampire is sucking

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.240
 on.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.120
 Or is it mutually good for everyone?

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.640
 No, it's never good for the person being sucked unless they want to become a vampire,

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.080
 which often does happen within that world.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.040
 But it's fantastic for Dracula.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.040
 The fictional world.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.040
 The fictional world.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:39.480
 It's fantastic for Dracula himself because he loves blood, and your blood is at its thickest,

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.480
 or at least it's much thicker when you're watching a vampire movie, a horror movie, anything

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.640
 with scares in it.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.640
 So.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.640
 Okay, two things.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.640
 Yeah.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.640
 Does he like thicker blood?

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.640
 Exactly.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.520
 Like if your milkshake gets too thick, you can't get it through the straw.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.320
 Oh, great point.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:01.080
 But if it's too thin, you send back your cup of milk, don't you?

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.080
 That's true.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.080
 So maybe it's just right.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.800
 And secondly, you said much thicker.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.360
 It's presumably not so thick it can't get through your veins and arteries.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.360
 It's like tar.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.360
 Yeah, exactly.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.360
 Okay.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.360
 Yeah.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.600
 No, it's just a bit thicker.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.320
 So it's a nice meal for Dracula.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.640
 This is a study that was done at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and basically they wanted

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:28.760
 to analyze blood samples from volunteers who had watched a horror movie, and then at another

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:34.320
 point watch a very distinctly very unfrightening movie, a documentary.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.840
 And so what they did was they found two different movies to show them.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.880
 They found the 2010 horror movie Insidious, which they showed to them.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.480
 And then a week later, they showed them a very, as they call it, non-alarmic documentary

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.520
 called A Year in Champagne.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.720
 What they found is that the people who sat through Insidious had high levels of the blood

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.920
 clotting protein, which is called Factor 8.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.800
 Did you know that this is pretty unrelated to the subject of this fact?

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:06.880
 But Champagne in Russia now can only be called Champagne if it's made not in Champagne, if

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.960
 it's made in Russia.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.720
 I think so everywhere else we're only allowed to call Champagne Champagne if it's made in

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.800
 the Champagne region.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.800
 It's one of those.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.760
 Whereas Russia has changed trademark laws so that it can only be if it's Russian Champagne.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.840
 So if not in America as well, you're allowed to call whatever you want Champagne in America.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.840
 Really?

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:29.480
 Yeah, because it was in the decision to call things Champagne, that rule, was in the Treaty

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.480
 of Versailles.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.280
 And the Americans never ratified the Treaty of Versailles.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.560
 They had their own treaty against the Germans.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.560
 Sorry.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:43.040
 Why are there being bolt-ons added to the Treaty of Versailles about Champagne nomenclature?

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.160
 I mean, shouldn't we be just focusing on, should we just fix on the water and the wars and

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.840
 bring that safely to a conclusion?

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.040
 I kind of feel like we're going quite a long way away from Danzbach to Dracula here.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.040
 Yeah, fine.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.440
 But yeah, basically it was because Germans were making sparkling wine as well.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:02.320
 And also the Champagne region had been quite badly hit by the war.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.320
 Vampires?

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.320
 Yeah.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.320
 Can we talk about real vampires for a bit?

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.320
 Yeah, go on.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.320
 But then proper...

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.320
 Not real.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.320
 The people who live in the world are vampires.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.320
 Sure.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.320
 Yeah.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.320
 So I was reading about them.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.580
 Basically, most of them don't drink blood.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:21.240
 There are a few, the Sanguinarians, but even they are really careful, obviously, because

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.200
 you can get all sorts of diseases from drinking blood.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:30.460
 But I think the vast majority are apparently psychic energy drainers who go along to places

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:35.720
 and feel the energy at places like concerts and then suck the life force from that.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.240
 But we all know people who, when you talk to them, you feel like you're having the life

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.640
 force suck from you.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.200
 And I just thought those were boring people.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.000
 But it turns out they might actually be vampires.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Is that right?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.880
 I think they also give massages.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:54.720
 I think the idea is like, if you give someone a massage, you can suck up their energy from

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.720
 that.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.720
 So rub it out of them.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.720
 Wow.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.240
 Well, also, if someone's going to suck away my psychic energy, then I want to be getting

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.280
 something in return for it, I guess.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.560
 So a massage seems like a fair deal.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.560
 That is a good deal.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.320
 Let's reverse Reiki instead of putting your good energy into someone, you're taking it

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.320
 out.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.320
 Reiki?

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.320
 OK.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.320
 I don't really know Reiki.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.320
 No, not really.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.160
 We've got into some ropey territory here, haven't we?

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.400
 Some non-fact-based territory.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.720
 It's pseudoscience, but it's quite famous.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.720
 Oh, sorry.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.040
 Let's get back to vampires and sucking psychic energy.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.040
 Yeah.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:31.600
 Well, you do get fang smiths as well, people who make prosthetic fangs for other vampires.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.960
 I read an interview with a bloke who's called Father Sebastian, so it's Sebastian, but with

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.680
 two As at the end in the final bit.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.320
 It's very touching, actually, that he's a fang smith because his grandfather was an orthodontist.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.320
 Oh.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.320
 Really?

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.520
 And so he stayed in the family business, but he's just catering for a slightly more niche

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.520
 audience.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.520
 Only makes canines, basically.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.520
 Yeah.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.400
 You can't do incisors, mate.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400
 Sorry.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.120
 Real vampires refer to themselves sometimes as 'hemosexuals', which I find quite funny.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.120
 That's nice.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.120
 That's quite good.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.120
 Apart from...

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.560
 It's not implied that you're attracted to blood, sexually.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.280
 Well, and they're very clear that they're not attracted to blood, sexually.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.280
 That's a completely different thing.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.240
 Well, why do they call themselves 'hemosexuals'?

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.120
 It's a funny quip, all right?

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.120
 It's just a...

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.480
 Yeah, I like that they're doing themselves any favours of people thinking they're just

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.480
 people.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.480
 No.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.760
 So maybe it's a nickname coined from outside the vamp community, I don't know.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:28.000
 They should focus really on the fact that we are in the minority as blood drinkers in

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 history, really, because there are just so many instances of people drinking blood, which

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.880
 I suppose makes sense.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:41.080
 It was quite available, but it's always the blood of criminals, it seems to me.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.920
 And so there's been this belief for thousands of years that blood drinking cured epilepsy.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:50.120
 I don't know where that came from, but it's right from ancient Rome, and people would

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:55.480
 drink the blood of vanquished gladiators, or more commonly, they'd drink the blood of

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.680
 beheaded criminals.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.400
 And this ran all the way up to, you know, 1500 years later.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.400
 In fact, in 1860, there was a source that reported epileptics would still stand around

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.800
 the executioner's block in Alaskan islands with cups in hand, waiting for the blood to

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.920
 spew out so that they could drink it.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.480
 It was always said that medically the blood that was best for curing epilepsy was the

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.160
 blood of criminals, which does seem quite convenient that it's also the blood that happens to be

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.480
 likely to flow from the executioner's block.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.000
 Yes, that's true.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.920
 I read one article on this subject, which I think made a good point, which is, if you

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:36.200
 see someone bleeding, God forbid they're bleeding to death, they're getting weaker

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.440
 and weaker as they lose the blood.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.440
 And so it does kind of make logical sense that ingesting blood would make you stronger,

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.280
 and that's probably why people have done it for most of history.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.280
 Right.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.280
 Right.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.640
 So if you see someone dying of loss of blood on the ground, should you hand over your arm

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.040
 and just let them gnaw on it until help comes?

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.040
 No.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.160
 They're a very, very, very scary film, and it will clot fast enough that actually they'll

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.160
 be fine.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.160
 Yeah.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:09.240
 Or try and maybe put some pressure on the large veins, maybe try and stop the bleeding.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.240
 Yeah.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.240
 Hopefully there's two of you.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.960
 So one of you can do the boo, and the other one can do the tourniquet.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.840
 I'll just re-enact a Dracula film while I'm...

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.840
 Yes.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.680
 Oh, one last thing, vampire bats.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.760
 So they do, you know how we were talking at the top of this fact about how would Dracula

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.440
 prefer to have thicker blood, would that not be too thick?

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:37.280
 So vampire bats have a saliva that contains an enzyme which is called draculin, and it

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:42.360
 basically prevents blood clotting, so that when it releases this thing, it goes into

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.380
 the bloodstream, which means the blood can just all flow much quicker.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.040
 So obviously directly named after Bram Stoker's creation.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.160
 How did you pronounce it, then?

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.160
 Draculin.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.720
 I think it's pronounced draculin, ah, ah, ah, ah, sorry.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.720
 Yes.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.960
 There's a silent "ha, ha, ha" in the writing here.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.120
 But yeah, and so what they've worked out is if they can take this enzyme, and there's

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.320
 tests that have been going on, there may be new results, but from when I last read it,

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:14.720
 it was still in the research stage, it can be applied to help stroke victims by breaking

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.760
 down blood clots, and stroke is an anagram of Stoker.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.560
 Dun, dun, dun, that is...

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.000
 Wow, you really beat that together.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 I love it.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.160
 I've got shivers down my spine and I can feel my blood thickening as you speak.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.040
 It goes all the way to the top.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:40.920
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:47.560
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1554, thousands of people in London were convinced that they

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:59.840
 heard an angel talking to them from behind a wall and slagging off the Queen.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:05.920
 Sorry, is that what an angel would do, though, if it came down to her?

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:12.000
 Well, if the Queen was Queen Mary, Bloody Mary, who was doing terrible things in the

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.340
 name of religion, then you might do, I don't know.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.160
 No, maybe you would as an angel.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:21.600
 So yeah, that's spoiler alert, the Queen that I'm referring to, Bloody Mary, who was on

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:28.080
 the throne at the time, obviously lots of upheaval in Europe about Protestantism and Catholicism

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.880
 and stuff like that.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:38.200
 The Queen was about to marry Philip, the second, I think, of Spain, and there were lots of

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:43.840
 people in England who weren't very happy about this because he was a big old Catholic, and

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.240
 so they tried to do whatever they could to stop it.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.560
 One of the things would be to rouse up the rabble, and one of the ways that they thought

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.880
 to do this was to pretend that there was an angel in a wall, and the angel in question

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:02.580
 was a woman called Elizabeth Crofts, who, according to the Dictionary of National Biography,

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:08.720
 nothing is known of her before 1554, and nothing was heard of her after 1554.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.320
 She just comes into history, does this amazing thing, and then disappears again.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.320
 It's incredible.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.320
 You've got a lot on, haven't you?

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.320
 Yeah.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.760
 I read a blog by a history writer called Susan Abernethy, and she was saying that they believe

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:28.480
 she might have been born in 1535 because there's details written that she was of a certain age,

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.400
 and so they've just pieced it back that way.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.760
 They believe that she was working in a house at the time as a maid, and so she was put behind

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.760
 this wall.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.800
 She was given a whistle so that she could make weird whistling noises, and then she also

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:46.880
 began to speak sort of anti-Catholic propaganda, and people started calling her the angel or

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.400
 a bird that was in the wall.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.020
 So it could have been a bird, is the other option, by the way.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.640
 Still crazy if a bird is saying stuff about the Queen's forthcoming marriage.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.600
 I would still stop on the street and listen to that, and they hid people in the crowd,

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.600
 unless it was Parrot Andy, who's going, "Parrot?

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.600
 Parrot?"

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.600
 Yeah, that's interesting.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.320
 I'm sort of now wondering what I would stop on the street for, as in if a parrot was doing

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.500
 quite convincing sectarian propaganda.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.840
 I would probably pause.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:19.680
 But even if you're in a rush, you're five minutes late for the podcast already, we're

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.320
 going to have no sympathy if it's, "Oh, I stopped on the street because there's a parrot giving

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.080
 anti-Catholic propaganda."

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.560
 Yeah, if I was in a rush, I'd probably just sort of hope it would still be there when

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:34.240
 I came back the other way, which I think she was, wasn't she, Elizabeth Crosses?

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.680
 She had to be stuck in, I think she was in the wall sort of, like she was hidden inside

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.680
 the wall.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.200
 Well, it was like a facade wall, yeah, that was put out in front of the main wall, I think,

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.800
 and she was sort of in between.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.920
 And it lasted days.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.040
 So yeah, did she sleep there?

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.040
 Did she go home?

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.800
 Was there a door in the other wall that she could go through?

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:51.800
 There must have been a way of getting her out.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.800
 So many questions.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.880
 I think the point though, Anna, is that it's saying it's a bird or an angel.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.240
 That would be the debate, Andy would be going by and he would just have an opinion going,

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.240
 "What's obviously a parrot?"

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.920
 And they're saying, "No, we think it might be an angel."

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.320
 You know, there's mystery there.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.320
 I see.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.320
 I see.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:09.440
 Well, we called up Ra in the end and they went to the mayor of London and the mayor

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.160
 of London said, "Well, why don't we just knock down the wall and see whether it's a bird

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.800
 or an angel or what?"

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:20.040
 And they knocked down the wall and sure enough, it was this woman, Elizabeth Crosses.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.240
 This just reminds me so much of when I tanned essays in late and I just wouldn't have a plan

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.280
 for when the teacher said, "Where's your essay?"

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.520
 It's like, surely the people who know that there's a girl behind the wall are watching

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.800
 the demolition men knocking brick after brick and saying, "How are we going to deal with

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.800
 this?"

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.800
 Yeah.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:40.560
 They should have put her in like either an angel or a parrot costume, shouldn't they?

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.560
 Yeah.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.560
 Yeah.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.560
 Exactly.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.560
 Or a brick costume.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.560
 Oh, brilliant.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.560
 Yes.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.560
 Oh, no.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.560
 But that's dangerous.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.840
 That's dangerous as someone comes in with a sledgehammer hitting bricks.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.840
 You don't want to be dressed as a brick.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.560
 But she can just say, "I'm a talking brick.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:58.120
 I'm a magical talking brick who's got strong opinions about the Queen's religious faith."

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.120
 Yeah.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.040
 You wouldn't dare destroy that, would you?

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.040
 No.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.960
 You could just say sort of quickly the context like why is all that, I mean James you've

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.440
 already said a bit of it, but basically England had been through a right old nightmare in

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:14.680
 the previous decades where England was Catholic and then Henry VIII, Mary's dad broke with

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.040
 the church and dissolved the monasteries and then his son Edward VI took England even further

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:25.560
 away from the Catholic church and then he died aged about 16 and then Mary, his half-sister

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.760
 became Queen and she was very Catholic, you know.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.760
 Dragged it back.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.240
 I mean poor old Edward who always gets accused of introducing a very Protestant regime and

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.240
 the guy was nine.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:42.240
 I mean there were just lots of old men behind him saying, "Say this now, I would say that."

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.720
 And the wall was very pro Queen Elizabeth, the future Queen Elizabeth.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.720
 The wall?

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.720
 The wall.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.080
 Yeah, the angel referred in the wall because they would cry out things like, "God save

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:56.440
 Queen Mary" and the wall would stay silent and then they'd say, "God save Lady Elizabeth"

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.560
 and the wall would say, "So be it."

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.680
 So they really wanted her to get into power because she would have kept it Protestant

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.000
 according to what they believed at the time.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.160
 You know that Pink Floyd song, "Break in the Wall" is actually based on this incident

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.160
 in 1554.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.160
 Yes.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.320
 You know, you're just another "Break in the Wall" is addressed to Elizabeth Croft.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:23.120
 And then what happened was because she was just a maid who don't need no education, she

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:28.200
 was let go basically, they decided that she must have been, there must have been other

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.120
 people behind it and must have been other people who talked her into it and probably

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.960
 she was just a pawn in their scheme and they let her go.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.080
 I think she was in prison for a couple of weeks and then...

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:44.120
 Was she doing it for any money, which is of course another very famous Pink Floyd song?

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:49.560
 I hope she didn't suffer any brain damage as a result of the wall being broken in on.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.560
 Is that another one?

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.560
 It is.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.560
 I think it is, yeah.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.560
 Yeah, anyway.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:31:01.120
 I always think it must be so awkward in the Tudor era when, as you say, there was Elizabeth,

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.920
 who was the daughter of Anne Boleyn, obviously, and then there was Protestant, and then there

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.840
 was Mary, who was very Catholic, and then there was Edward, who was Protestant.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.640
 But they all hung out together as well.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:15.360
 I mean, Mary was essentially sent away from the royal household when Henry divorced Catherine

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.720
 of Aragon, but then she was sort of brought back in a bit of a disgrace because she was

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.600
 Catholic, but brought back in, she's hanging out with Elizabeth, but at the same time,

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.960
 they both know that they're on opposite sides.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:27.960
 They also...

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:33.380
 Elizabeth also lived with Lady Jane Gray, which I didn't realize, which for internationalists

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.800
 is as famous here as the Nine-Day Queen.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.800
 And she's...

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.920
 She's the Liz Truss of the monarchy, isn't she?

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.920
 She's...

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.680
 Famous is such a generous way of putting it, Anna.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.400
 I mean, Lady Jane Gray is not...

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.280
 We're not all going around talking about Lady Jane Gray today.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.280
 She's pretty obscure.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.280
 She's a huge celeb.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.960
 Lady Jane Gray and the Kardashians are very much forefront of everyone's mind.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.120
 No, okay, maybe she's famous in year 10 history classes.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:01.320
 So basically, she was the Protestant, who Edward and the people behind Edward wanted

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.320
 on the throne.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.320
 Right.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.320
 And then Mary had her executed.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.320
 Yeah.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.320
 And then Mary had her executed.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.360
 Which was kind of par for the course, because you've got to have the people who acclaimance

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.360
 to the throne...

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.360
 Yeah.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.360
 You know, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.360
 Yeah.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.360
 I do...

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.600
 Mary, Queen Mary, Bloody Mary, has a really, really bad reputation, and I think a lot of

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:21.920
 it is a deeply inherited propaganda, as in you're just kind of assumed, "Oh, just that

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.040
 she was the awkward awful bit before Queen Elizabeth came in and sorted it all out."

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:30.140
 But her teenage years were really, I just think of how embarrassed you are as a teenager.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:36.240
 And basically, firstly, your parents break up, okay, then your dad changes the entire

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.600
 religious structure of the country so that he can remarry.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.600
 That must be tough as well.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.600
 And then...

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.600
 Exactly.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.400
 And then he annulls his marriage to your mum.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:50.000
 So suddenly, your parents were never married, so now she's illegitimate, and you are downgraded

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.680
 from a princess to a lady.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.680
 So I mean...

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.680
 Yeah, but she's always...

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.180
 It must have been very embarrassing.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:59.160
 But whenever she's whinging about that, she's always got little sister Elizabeth there

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.480
 putting her hand up, going, "Uh, mate, our dad killed my mum."

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.480
 Yeah.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.480
 Chopped her head off.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.480
 So keep your mouth shut, love.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:10.080
 But I read that she had to then become part of the sort of servant crew for Elizabeth.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.580
 So she didn't even just get demoted.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.160
 She was actively then sort of like, "Here's your breakfast."

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.160
 Little sister.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.160
 Yeah.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.160
 Yeah.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.160
 Oh.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.160
 Harsh.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.440
 It is funny that she's remembered as Bloody Mary still now, even though that is anti-catholic

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.440
 propaganda, really.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.640
 Or it's the fact that Protestantism or the Church of England won over.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:35.520
 And also there was that very famous book, Fox's Book of Martyrs, that was...

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.080
 I mean, it's hard to underestimate how popular this book was.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.160
 It was published in 1563, so shortly after Mary had died.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:46.080
 And it was basically the book of all the great Christian martyrs who had died for their faith

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.080
 throughout time.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.960
 And it ended with all of Mary's martyrs.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:54.280
 So she killed about 260 people, I think, burned at the stake.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.960
 And so this was a great piece of propaganda against Mary.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.440
 But it sold like 150 million copies.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.440
 No.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.440
 Hang on.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.440
 Hang on.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.840
 That's greater than the world's population.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.360
 It was over many hundreds of years.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.780
 So for about 300 years, it was the best-selling book alongside the Bible.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.400
 And it was so gory.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.840
 I mean, there's got to be a reason it was so popular.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:20.280
 And I think it was the amazing detail of how these people died.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.200
 Like Anne Askew, do you know Anne Askew?

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:27.560
 Well, she called Anne Askew before she died, or did the Askew bit come after whatever happened

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.400
 to her?

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:34.040
 She was the first English woman ever to demand a divorce because she was Protestant.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.440
 Her husband was Catholic.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.240
 She didn't like that.

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:42.020
 And she refused to accept transubstantiation, so refused to believe that the bread was the

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.580
 body of Christ.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:48.540
 And we should say of all these people, I think if they'd recounted, they wouldn't have been

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.540
 burned.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.540
 Oh, yeah.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.540
 It's their fault.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.540
 Oh, take this.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.540
 Take the side of Bloody Mary.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.540
 Go on.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.540
 Die, don't you?

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:56.540
 Show a bit of balance.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:00.420
 She was put on the rack and stretched, which is always nice when you hear about one of

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:05.700
 these really sort of torture instruments you learn about at primary school being used.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.400
 And she was stretched, and all of her limbs were dislocated.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.680
 So that will make you Askew, I mean.

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:14.640
 She was right Askew, yeah, fitting.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.760
 And then she was executed, and she had to be carried to the stake on a chair because she

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:23.640
 couldn't walk understandably, I imagine sort of flopping over this chair.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640
 Lovely.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.520
 Yeah, so it's that kind of stuff you can see why it's a bestseller.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:31.240
 Yeah, I think another, I mean, obviously the 200 years of propaganda in England defining

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:35.040
 itself specifically as being a non-Catholic country will have played into it, but I think

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.620
 another thing was that the burning at the stake, Elizabeth had loads of people executed.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:44.580
 She had loads of religious heretics executed as well, but she tended to execute them as

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.660
 traitors instead of heretics.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:51.140
 So it was seen as more of a political thing, or it's easier to write off as a political

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:55.380
 decision rather than Bloody Mary, the religious, you know, religious.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:36:02.260
 I mean, Henry VIII, like what, 60,000 probably, compared to a few hundred for Bloody Mary.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.720
 But yeah, they're just like, "Oh, well, they weren't birds at the stake.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.720
 It wasn't heresy."

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.720
 So...

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:13.480
 I was trying to think if, because I knew nothing about Mary and the Bloody Mary name.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.880
 Is that where we get the name for the drink?

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.920
 I sort of had a quick look into that.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.080
 Well, no, there's no idea.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.360
 Lots of theories about what it could be.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.360
 Bloody Mary is obviously one of them.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.360
 She's included in there.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.800
 There's a thought that it might be the Hollywood star Mary Pickford.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:31.400
 But one of the main ones is that, and this is quite a famous bar called Harry's New York

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.060
 bar, which I, you know, weirdly is in Paris.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.020
 But according to the manager...

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:41.380
 I'd run by a guy called Jeff.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.460
 According to the manager, there used to be a cocktail waitress called Mary, who used

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:52.020
 to work in a Chicago bar called the Bucket of Blood, and supposedly it was that.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.020
 Yeah.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.020
 That's cool.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.020
 We don't know.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.140
 Yeah, probably after that rather than the really famous historical figure who was just

00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.140
 called Bloody Mary.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:03.720
 It is amazing all those cocktails because they're all within memory of people, you know, they're

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:09.320
 all within a couple of generations, but almost every cocktail, the name is lost to the mists

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.800
 of time, isn't it?

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.640
 It's because everyone's pissed, aren't they?

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.800
 As soon as they've invented it, no one can remember how it happened.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:23.280
 I was looking up the sort of propaganda at the time, and it was the big age of the pamphlet.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:28.200
 I kind of hope it comes back one day, the pamphlet, because it's a right old ass writing

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.200
 a book.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.620
 Have you tried recently, James?

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.820
 Oh, yeah, I have actually.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:38.380
 Anna and I, in fact, wrote everything to play for the QI Book of Spots, but, you know, far

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.380
 beyond from me.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:43.980
 I just wrote a pamphlet version, which I think you incorporate into your larger book.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.700
 But yeah, it's basically there was such good propaganda, pamphlets.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:47.700
 I don't mean your book.

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:52.060
 I'm sure your book is scrupulously even-handed.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.340
 You can print them in a couple of days.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.100
 You can distribute them fast and cheap.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.520
 It was like people having sub-stacks today.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.160
 I found out this is slightly later.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.320
 This is a later anti-Catholic document from 1624 called The Travels of Time, right?

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:10.240
 And it was printed, again, as a sort of regal monarchy commentary.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:16.720
 So Charles I, who was seen as being quite pro-Catholic, was going to marry the Spanish

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.840
 Infanta, which was a princess, not an infant.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.840
 I mean, given the time, she might also have been eight, but I don't know.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:30.060
 But the marriage collapsed and people printed, I find this so, again, it's quite gossipy,

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:33.940
 but they just printed these pamphlets to celebrate the collapse of the marriage, the prospective

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.540
 marriage between the two of them.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.820
 And again, if people were doing that about me, I'd be hurt.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.660
 But there were all these allegorical images.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.660
 That was a huge thing.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.900
 And people got all the allegories in these pamphlets.

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:47.860
 So one of the images in this pamphlet showed the Spanish ambassador to England, Don Diego

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:53.120
 Samiento de Akuma Gondemar, using his buttocks to incubate locust eggs.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:58.200
 And that was an acceptable political point to make at the time.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.200
 That is quite good though.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.080
 What's the political, hold on, what do the locust eggs represent?

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.280
 Is that the spawn of the devil?

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.680
 I think they might represent papacy, popism, you know, that kind of stuff.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.680
 And it was incredibly rude.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:14.440
 This is quite an obscure historical paper, I found this then, because he was, and I'm

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.780
 quoting here, the renowned sufferer of an anal fistula.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:22.780
 So it was especially funny to show him with locust eggs in his bum.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:23.780
 Ouch.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:24.780
 I know.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.780
 That's a tough one.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.720
 What a terrible part of your bio that gets used for, like, chat shows.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.620
 Famous sufferer of anal fistula.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:39.420
 He prefers to talk about Anglo-Spanish diplomacy, but of course, we know he's Mr. Fistula.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.820
 Welcome to the stage.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:47.600
 Mr. Fistula does sound like quite a good music hall name for someone, does it?

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.600
 Yeah.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:55.320
 Until 1910, when you became king or queen, you had to swear that you repudiated Catholicism

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.160
 as superstitious and idolatrous.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.560
 Isn't that amazing?

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.220
 Until the 20th century, you had to do that.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:08.520
 And then Edward VII said, Edward VII did do it, but he insisted on whispering the words,

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:12.100
 because he thought it would be an insult to any Catholics who were living in the country

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.100
 at the time.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.100
 It does sound like it was.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.100
 Yeah.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:19.820
 Who were famously hard of hearing, weren't they?

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:28.620
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:34.460
 My fact this week is that this year, a woman was injured when she was attacked twice.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:39.920
 Once by a five-foot-long snake that fell from the sky, then immediately afterwards by the

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.880
 hawk that dropped it.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:46.160
 This was really some idol maternity leave reading, actually.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.640
 I think I read it in the week.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.760
 It's just the most incredible story.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:55.720
 It's a woman called Peggy Jones in Texas who was mowing her lawn, and a large snake fell

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.720
 out of the sky.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:02.440
 Her husband estimated later that it was 4.5 feet long, which is large, and it wrapped

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.640
 itself around her arm.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.520
 I'm kind of imagining, you know those things that you used to slap your arm with as a kid,

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.020
 and they wrapped around them.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.020
 They'd wrap around, yeah.

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:13.020
 Yeah, I'm sort of imagining it did that as it fell, and she tried to shake it off, and

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:18.500
 it got tighter and tighter, and the hawk that had been carrying the snake in its mouth plunged

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:22.540
 down and started attacking it to try and get the snake back, and they both managed to

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:27.060
 inflict multiple injuries, so the hawk was flying at her and grabbing for the snake and

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:32.620
 slapping her with its wings and clawed these deep cuts in her arm.

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:37.440
 The snake, meanwhile, was striking her in the face and chipping her glasses, and apparently

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.920
 spewing a liquid.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.620
 And I love her husband, Wendell, got to her by riding over on his mower.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.620
 Yeah, I'm imagining.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:46.620
 Oh wow.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:47.620
 Hurry up, Wendell!

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.620
 Go into fifth gear!

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.120
 What a scene.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:58.200
 So she's one of the first people to have been involved in a snake and bird incident since

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:05.380
 just two years ago when Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson was, I mean it was a minor celebrity

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:09.500
 story, he was temporarily barricaded in his home because there was a snake right outside

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:13.700
 his front door, which was busy being eaten by a large hawk, which was busy eating the

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:14.700
 snake.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:18.620
 And whenever he kind of got near it, it was threatening and flapping at him.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.620
 Wow.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.120
 Miner celebrity.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.240
 Probably one of the highest paid actors on earth.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:27.280
 Sorry, I don't mean to call him a minor, I mean the story is a minor story about a major

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.180
 celebrity, but I think we can all agree it's not one of the main things in his life, this

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.180
 story.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.180
 What a rowback.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:40.180
 I just don't want to smell what he's cooking, and I'm very happy to say he's a big deal,

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.180
 you know?

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.980
 He's in "Jumanji" for heaven's sake, the new one, not the original.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:48.100
 The new one, by the way, which has a body swap part in it, which reminds me of an old

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.060
 book called "Ice Person".

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:58.640
 Several attacks, they happen way more than I realized, as in if you just do a new search,

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.520
 there are multiple stories globally that are just pumped out every single day.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:08.320
 So just 24 hours ago, when I was, you know, looking at these facts, an Australian farmer,

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:13.480
 he described himself to the BBC and other outlets as "lucky to be alive" after repelling

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:17.160
 a crocodile by biting the crocodile back.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:23.940
 So he found his face leaning against the crocodile's head, and he bit the eyelid of the crocodile,

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:28.180
 making the crocodile freak out, it let go of its bite, and he was able to escape, but

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:33.180
 it was only by biting the crocodile back that he was able to get out there.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.180
 So many news articles.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:38.900
 Look, this is literally the last three days, "Arizona Woman", fatally trampled by elk,

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:43.540
 she might have been trying to feed, "Pornstar's Pet Python", "Bite's Partner's Penis" and

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.540
 "Horocene", "Blood Everywhere".

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:51.060
 Yeah, I mean, the animal world is famously dangerous, Dan, but on things that you don't

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.280
 expect to attack you, I think of otters.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.960
 Well, otters, I think, are the cutest animals alive.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:03.840
 And so I was very surprised about an otter attack on someone called Lea Hillier.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:08.560
 This was a few years ago, and it's really incredible that it was in Minnesota on this

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:13.920
 remote lake, and she always went for a swim in the lake, she was staying at her dad's

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.780
 lake house with her kids, always went for a swim in the lake, she swam a mile a day,

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:22.900
 felt one day something bite her leg, and then about 20 feet away, really quickly, an otter

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:27.300
 bobbed its head up, and then it kept swimming back to her leg and biting her leg again,

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.340
 and then swimming away and then bobbing its head up and looking at her.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:36.500
 And it bit her 25 times, and like properly, it pierced her ankle bone, it pierced through

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:43.900
 her calf muscle, just an otter, and she was screaming for help, and her dad, her poor dad

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:48.120
 had heard these screams and tried to start the motorboat to get to her, and in his panic,

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.760
 he flooded the engine of the motorboat, and he also had to get the kids, she had two kids

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:56.800
 who were two and four, so he had to get the kids on the boat, so he got another boat started,

00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:03.760
 got out to her, dragged these poor kids' blood drenched mother out of the water, and the

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:07.640
 maddest thing for me is she got out of the water, got to hospital, was given a rabies

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:12.160
 shot in every single one of the 25 bites, which made her vomit.

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.940
 Two weeks later, she got back in the lake.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:20.060
 The otter's still in it, the otter's just there, bobbing away, which I feel like I wouldn't

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.060
 go swimming again.

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.060
 That's bullseye.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:28.460
 You see a few otter stories of them attacking people, there was a minor celebrity story,

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:33.180
 and I actually will say this is about a minor celebrity, an actor called Crystal Finn, who

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:37.820
 was in succession, but one of the quite minor characters in succession, I'm sure she's an

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:42.500
 amazing actor, but I'd never heard of her before, she got beaten on her backside and

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:47.360
 on her leg this year by otters, there was a guy called Graham George Spencer, who was

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:53.220
 bitten 26 times in 10 seconds by otters, isn't that amazing?

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.420
 Was that multiple otters?

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.600
 It was a pack of otters, yeah.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:00.280
 I don't know what the record is for the world's fastest draw, but that would be up there.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:07.000
 His friend ran over screaming to try and scare off the otters, and they swam away, but then

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.460
 the pair said they ran towards the visitor centre to get help, still pursued by the

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:12.460
 otters.

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.460
 Oh no.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:17.700
 Exit pursued by an otter.

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:21.540
 I was reading an article about why animals don't attack us more than they already do,

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:25.060
 and obviously, most of the time, when animals attack humans, it's because we're in their

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:30.540
 space, or because they're protecting their young nearby, or because we're on their territory.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:35.460
 Because we're bipedal, we look bigger, we don't look bigger than we are, but we look

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:39.120
 bigger than we would if we were on all fours.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.440
 That's kind of a little bit of a bluff.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:45.080
 It makes us look a bit tougher, and also, it does mean we're slower.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.000
 You can't outrun a cat.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.120
 That's kind of maybe perceived as a bit of a show of strength.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:56.320
 I don't need to be able to outrun a cat because I'm so tough.

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.960
 That's risky, isn't it?

00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:58.960
 I don't know if that's...

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:05.040
 That way, your MMA career is going so well, indeed, because you're like, "I'm so good

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.040
 at MMA.

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.420
 I don't even have to work out.

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:09.140
 I don't have to get buff.

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.300
 I don't have to be strong-looking."

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.300
 Yeah.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.740
 No one has ever turned up to a fight with me in the MMA ring because they're so terrified

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:20.980
 of this quite average-looking bloke who seems to have done no exercise.

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:21.980
 Yeah.

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.820
 I'm always really skeptical about the older, "Make yourself look bigger by putting your

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:25.820
 arms out."

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.780
 I guess it must be true because it does work, but it is like, are bears blind?

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.580
 Can they not see that once we put our arms out?

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:36.120
 It's just two small spindly things sticking out of us.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.160
 Why do they suddenly go, "Oh my God, he's absolutely massive?"

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.960
 I've never noticed before.

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:46.440
 If you're bipedal, you're bigger looking to something that's looking at you from the

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:53.400
 side, but worms probably think we're smaller than we are because from a worms-eye view,

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.080
 if we were on our old foes, we'd be much bigger.

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.080
 Yeah.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.080
 And hawks, actually.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.680
 Maybe this one was attacked by a hawk because...

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.680
 That's true.

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.900
 They're gone for hawks, actually, rather than worms.

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:04.900
 No, I like worms.

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:05.900
 I think that's good.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:09.900
 That's why you get so many worm attacks in these days.

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:10.900
 They cover them up.

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:11.900
 You do.

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:12.900
 We just wouldn't know.

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:13.900
 Worms are attacking us all the time.

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:14.900
 We've just got no idea.

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.500
 Just headbutting us for a bill.

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:21.580
 The Hitchcock film, The Worms, was a complete commercial and critical flop, wasn't it?

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.740
 You know, Aeschylus.

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:28.260
 So we mentioned before, ancient Greek playwright who was killed when a bird dropped a tortoise

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:29.260
 on his head.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:30.260
 Oh, yeah.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:35.640
 So what the idea was that the hawks dropped turtles on rocks to open them up so they can

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.640
 eat the delicious turtle inside, and they thought his head was a rock because he was

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.640
 so bald.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.640
 That was the claim.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.640
 That is the claim.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.640
 Yeah.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.480
 So I just sort of looked him up because I don't think we mentioned anything really

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.840
 more about him at the time, just he was an ancient Greek playwright.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.800
 And so I found out this about him.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.680
 There is a theory that he invented people talking to each other on stage.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:58.680
 Oh.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.260
 He was a pretty early dramatist.

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:03.120
 And this is a claim by Aristotle.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.820
 So you know, pinch of salt and some earlier sources will have been lost, blah, blah, blah.

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:11.540
 But Aristotle claims that basically he invented characters who had conflict between each other.

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:15.020
 And before that, characters could only speak to the chorus, and everyone was speaking to

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:17.860
 the chorus and not to each other on stage.

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:18.860
 What an innovation.

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:19.860
 What a moment.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.980
 Yeah, that must have been huge.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:25.180
 And if he hadn't come up with that, we would still all have to be talking to the chorus.

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:26.180
 Everything would be to the chorus.

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:27.180
 Yeah.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.180
 Yeah.

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:32.100
 It's hard to have invented the chorus element first, though, because it seems less of it.

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:36.560
 Because in normal life, it's not like when I chat to someone, it's always mediated by

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.400
 a group of 12 people singing annoying songs.

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.840
 I just do it direct.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:41.840
 It's quite odd, isn't it?

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.760
 No, but then maybe that's what separated it as fantasy from real life.

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.480
 Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to tell the difference, maybe.

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.560
 He's like Ricky Gervais inventing the office.

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.120
 Suddenly, sitcom is just...

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:56.600
 Eucalus, the Ricky Gervais of his time.

00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:00.620
 Back to snakes that have been attacking people.

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:06.100
 I read a story about a guy who's called Valentin Grimaldo from Texas.

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:10.580
 A coral snake came up and bit him on his hand.

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:11.780
 He grabbed the snake.

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:18.180
 He bit its head off and then used the snake as a band around his arm to cut off.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:19.180
 No.

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:20.180
 Yeah.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.180
 Like what they call the tonic.

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:22.180
 Tonic.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.180
 Yeah.

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:24.180
 Yeah.

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:26.300
 He used that around his arm and then they went off to the hospital's emergency room and

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:27.300
 he was fine.

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.360
 He's still got the head as a keepsake.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.520
 Wow.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.520
 That's really ignominious.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.520
 That's wild.

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.520
 That's a snake, isn't it?

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.520
 How embarrassing.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.520
 You know dragons.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.520
 Sure.

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.520
 Yeah.

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:38.520
 Not real.

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:42.360
 There is a theory and I think it is a true theory that basically dragons are just sexed

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.360
 up snakes.

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:45.520
 To what extent is it true theories, Ori?

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.720
 I think it's true.

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:51.760
 I think when you look at like people writing about dragons, especially in the Middle Ages,

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:58.820
 they start off being these worm-like creatures with no legs that have stripes on their body

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:00.220
 and forked tongues.

00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:05.100
 And then as the Middle Ages progresses to the Renaissance, they just become more and

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:09.820
 more fantastical that they can fly and breathe fire and stuff like that.

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:15.940
 And so what we reckon is because the kind of story started off in the Southern Europe

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:21.680
 and Egypt and whatever where there were plenty of snakes and then they came up into Europe

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.340
 where there weren't so many snakes.

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:26.800
 People just started adding stuff because they didn't know what snakes were like really.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:31.240
 In the Iliad, the original or the earliest version of the Iliad that we have, it says

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:36.920
 that the dragon could be eaten by eagles, which obviously the modern day dragon, you

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.040
 would not be possibly to do that.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.040
 No.

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.440
 Bizarrely, on an earlier fact, I had to think about the Odyssey, which I didn't say.

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:46.300
 Which is that the Odyssey features the first appearance in literature of black pudding.

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.300
 Oh, does it?

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.980
 It was about people eating blood.

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.180
 I think that was why I was on that tangent.

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.180
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:54.380
 It's a sort of goatee blood sausage that they have and it is clearly a black pudding.

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.380
 Oh, wow.

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:56.380
 And that's in the Odyssey.

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:58.780
 What's the bigger innovation, do you think, Andy, the introduction of black pudding or

00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:00.740
 chatting to each other on stage?

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:01.740
 Interesting.

00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:02.740
 Gosh.

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:03.740
 They're both massive, aren't they?

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:07.040
 They're both huge deals, but in such different spheres of endeavour.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:11.260
 I reckon most people on Earth could say they could live without one.

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.360
 I could live without black pudding.

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.360
 That's the one I think, Anna, is.

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:19.040
 No, no, no, I think some people would say they could live without drama but not black

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.040
 pudding.

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.600
 You know, I'm sure there are people in the people.

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.600
 In the North.

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.040
 Yeah, say it, Anna, people in the North.

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:32.720
 It was actually, it was going to go as far as Scotland, in fact, in my stereotyping.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:36.120
 Do we still get Coronation Street and black pudding?

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.120
 Can we say that at least?

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:41.240
 You can get Coronation Street, but everything is mediated through the character of Emma

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.460
 Elsie Tanner, who plays the chorus.

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:44.460
 Yeah.

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:49.620
 Speaking of snakes, have you guys ever seen, and I address this mainly to Dan, a documentary

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:53.700
 on the Discovery Channel in 2014 called Eaton Alive?

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:59.980
 Is this where the guy decided to be eaten by a snake and ingested?

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:00.980
 I knew you know about him.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:01.980
 Yeah.

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:02.980
 Well, because he went in the wrong way, I think, is the story.

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:03.980
 He went in head first.

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:04.980
 He went in first.

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:05.980
 Oh, sorry.

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:09.140
 He didn't crawl up the snake's arse.

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:10.140
 Sorry.

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:13.680
 I've gone in the wrong way, guys.

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:24.960
 It's such a mad, stupid thing to do, and Paul Rosalie was his name, and he, first of all,

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:29.360
 he was on an expedition in the Amazon to find the biggest anaconda there was, a biggest

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.600
 green anaconda there was.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.600
 Yeah, cool.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.600
 He'd heard tell that existed.

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:33.600
 It would be over 24 feet long.

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:34.600
 It would be the world's longest.

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.880
 And once he got there, he was going to let it eat him.

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:38.880
 And this--

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.580
 Was there a day that he was in a sleeping bag or something, or that he was in some kind

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:43.460
 of sack, which he could then wriggle out of?

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:47.380
 He wore a special suit so he could survive it, and then he was going to be extracted

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:48.380
 from the snake.

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:49.380
 So he wouldn't be digested, yeah.

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:50.380
 And--

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:51.380
 Did he go into the--

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:52.380
 He totally screwed up.

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:56.620
 So first of all, he didn't find the big anaconda, so he had to be supplied with a 20-foot one

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.420
 from a zoo.

00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:03.060
 Then he had this suit, which they drenched in pig's blood, to make the snake want to

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:04.060
 eat him.

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:05.060
 Yeah, yeah.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:08.960
 And then he said, he saw the snake's mouth open, everything went black, I think his head

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.720
 went into the snake, his shoulders maybe went into the snake.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:16.840
 What about his knees and toes?

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.820
 And then he was a starfish, so it became very confusing.

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:23.680
 That is going to be a real-- when I listen back to that edit and see which of us got

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:26.120
 it burst with that one, it was a real--

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:27.120
 Photo finish.

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.120
 Yeah.

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:32.360
 So wait, sorry, his head went into the snake and everything went black.

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:33.360
 How mysterious.

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.360
 Yeah.

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:35.580
 So then, yeah, then what?

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:36.580
 I mean, I think he--

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:37.580
 Well, then, yeah.

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:38.580
 He tapped out.

00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:43.500
 The snake started twisting his body and started wrenching his arm around a bit, and he suddenly

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:48.740
 thought, oh, this hurts, my arm's hurting, and started shouting to the technical assistants,

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.220
 can you get me out now, please?

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.100
 He wasn't on his own, so he was shouting from inside the snake, get me out, I'm done.

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:56.940
 And so they managed to extract him from the snake.

00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:57.940
 Wow.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:58.940
 Yeah.

00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:01.220
 Did he shout, I'm a minor celebrity, get me out of here?

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:04.720
 He's not the rock.

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:08.880
 He said it was all to raise awareness about the plight of wildlife in the Amazon, about

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:11.520
 which there's some skepticism from me.

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:15.000
 Well, he just has, because now we've got some message.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 No one's coming away from this podcast thinking, oh, the plight of animals in the Amazon, that's

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 why I remembered.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:29.080
 They're thinking idiot shoved his head in a snake.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.200
 OK, that's it.

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.200
 That is all of our facts.

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.380

00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:35.640

 place where the fans get together called Discord.

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.080
 It's a great place.
