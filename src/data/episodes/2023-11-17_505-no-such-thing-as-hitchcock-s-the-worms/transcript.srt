00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:19,400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,960
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,560
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,760
 Anna Tyshinski and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,240
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,680
 Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,880
 My fact is that for years scientists thought Starfish had no heads.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,080
 It now turns out they have no bodies.

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,080
 [Laughter]

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
 Wow.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
 All head.

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,760
 Or even the arms heads, no.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
 Yeah.

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,920
 I think what this shows is that it's actually quite hard to describe Starfish in terms of

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
 human anatomy.

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
 Yeah.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
 [Laughter]

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,720
 So what's the difference between head and body according to this definition?

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
 Okay.

21
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,880
 This is the result of a new study from Stanford University and I think maybe one or two other

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,880
 places.

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,560
 And it's about the genetic code that sort of programmes Starfish because Starfish are

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,600
 really, really weird bodily as in they start out with bilateral symmetry, which is what

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,160
 humans have as in you've got two sides, you've got a left and a right and it's sort of the

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,600
 same, you know, you're mirrored.

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,400
 So Starfish start out like that when they're first born and then they kind of grow out

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,720
 of it and they become the starfish shape that we know.

29
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,800
 And so what this study is, it looked at the genetic code which kind of programmes head

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,040
 like territory and it turns out that they have that in each of their arms and the middle,

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,320
 the middle bit, which joins all the arms together, has more head like genetics.

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,120
 Not one bit of the starfish contains the genetic programme which we associate in our

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,280
 own bodies with a trunk or a torso.

34
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,960
 Are they one entity or the arms, mini heads?

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
 Okay.

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
 So it's not like one big orbiting head?

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,680
 It's a bit like that.

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,000
 Like we used to think it was imagine your body, but then we cut off your head and so you're

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,560
 just the middle with some arms and legs sticking out.

40
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,960
 But now what it turns out is imagine someone took off your arms and legs and super glued

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
 them to your head.

42
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,960
 That's it.

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,840
 Although, I read, and I don't know if this is one of the guys involved in the study,

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,600
 a biologist called Thurston Lakali, which is just a really cool name.

45
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,920
 He said we should be thinking of them as a disembodied head walking about the sea floor

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,680
 on its lips.

47
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,520
 So are you saying the legs are the lips?

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
 Legs.

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,000
 Well, yeah, kind of, except that also Dan, in this example where we've removed your arms

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,800
 and legs, we've also super glued your anus to the back of your head.

51
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,720
 So yes, you are walking out of your mouth too.

52
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,520
 Dan, you're becoming more and more attractive by the minute.

53
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,360
 Please fan art, send to Andy.

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,760
 Basically, what the main headline is is that there's no way for a starfish to sing the

55
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,840
 song head, shoulders, knees and toes.

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,200
 There's just no analogy for that.

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,960
 That's his head, head, head, lips, feet.

58
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
 Anus.

59
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
 Anus.

60
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,760
 Anus, head, head, lips and feet.

61
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,760
 Lips and feet.

62
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
 Amazing.

63
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
 That's incredible.

64
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,640
 Is this why they have that feature that I think we must have mentioned before, where

65
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,400
 even if you cut off the main circular bit that looks like a body to us and just are

66
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,680
 left with a leg, they can regrow and regenerate their entire self from just a leg.

67
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
 Oh, yeah.

68
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,080
 Maybe is that related to the fact that each leg actually has this genetic head material

69
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,360
 in it that can sprout everything.

70
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
 Yeah.

71
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
 And you.

72
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
 But it's a cool thing to be able to do anyway.

73
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,480
 Imagine someone just cutting all of your body off except your finger and then your finger

74
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,760
 grow a whole new body on it.

75
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
 It's mental.

76
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
 It's absolutely crackers.

77
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,920
 The regeneration thing is insane because as you say, like a tiniest bit can be chopped

78
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,000
 off and they can grow into a whole new starfish and that's really messed up a lot of fishermen

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 back in the day.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,440
 So there's areas of the world where they would eat the local oyster population.

81
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,500
 This is the starfish and they were depleting it.

82
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,400
 So what fishermen used to do is when they got a starfish out, they'd kill it and they'd

83
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,960
 kill it by slashing it into two or five or whatever and then just chucking them back into

84
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,120
 the ocean, not realizing they were creating a giant army of starfish.

85
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,840
 Like what I imagine the gremlins were if I ever watched that movie.

86
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,080
 Is that what happens?

87
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,440
 You put water on them and they all double in.

88
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,680
 Is that what happens when they multiply?

89
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
 I can't remember.

90
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
 I haven't seen it.

91
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
 Guys, what are you?

92
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
 What are you?

93
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
 Yeah, of course.

94
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
 Dan, I'm really disappointed in you.

95
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
 Sorry.

96
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,840
 Do the gremlins get chopped up into smaller pieces and then create more gremlins?

97
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,240
 If you put water on them, they multiply.

98
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,800
 If you feed them after midnight, they become evil.

99
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,920
 If you expose them to sunlight, they die.

100
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,880
 How many anuses do they have?

101
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,280
 That is very vexed doctrine.

102
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,920
 There is a big debate among us gremlin heads.

103
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,160
 There's an amazing thing that they do as well when they're eating.

104
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,640
 Starfish will basically send their stomach to go and get the meal.

105
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,360
 So say if they're eating something like there's a thing called the sand dollar, which is quite

106
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,120
 a flat little species and you find it on the floor of the ocean, they'll send their stomach

107
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,520
 out, they'll surround it and they'll melt down the body of it into the food, bring it

108
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,840
 back in and just leave the skeleton.

109
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
 You know what?

110
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,440
 If we did that, then probably the job of delivering a screwdriver would be quite bad.

111
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,560
 My delivery screwdriver is don't stick around and watch me eat my meal.

112
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,240
 Yeah, but you'll have to because instead of you coming to the door, your stomach would

113
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,680
 come to the door and when they handed you the food, your stomach would kind of envelope

114
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,360
 around the bag of Chinese takeaway.

115
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,480
 Leaving only the plastic Tupperware behind.

116
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,560
 I can't believe yours don't watch you eat Anna.

117
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,280
 Maybe I'm tipping generously enough that they do, but they always stick around through

118
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
 the letterbox.

119
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:00,080
 What interesting thing about this stomach inside out thing is that you know oxytocin,

120
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,560
 they call it the love chemical.

121
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,200
 Very important in childbirth, it's like what stimulates a lot of changes in the body when

122
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,320
 you have a baby and stuff like that.

123
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,200
 I think I want to go on about it, don't they?

124
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,280
 Oh my God, lights and scented candles, play some music, oh that'll get your oxytocin

125
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
 going.

126
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,080
 Literally, if you ever go to one of those things where they teach you how to be a parent, if

127
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,200
 they ask you any question, just say oxytocin and that is always the answer, doesn't matter

128
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
 what it is.

129
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,920
 But anyway, not if you're a starfish.

130
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,160
 If you're a starfish, oxytocin makes your stomach go inside out.

131
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,080
 So it's in starfish world, it's known as the stomach inside out hormone, not the love

132
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,240
 hormone.

133
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,640
 And they go to special lessons, don't they, about how to eat their first meal and it's

134
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,840
 well, lighter scented candle, difficult underwater, but you can do it.

135
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,400
 So it's good for, as in it's not in a bad way, as in it's not bad for them.

136
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
 Yeah, it's good.

137
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,240
 It's the chemical which they release when they're hungry so that it kind of sets into

138
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,080
 motion this thing that Dan described.

139
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,840
 And so we kind of use it for something different?

140
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,000
 Yeah, we use it to feel love.

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,600
 Yeah, to make changes in the body to help you to procreate.

142
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
 Yeah.

143
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,600
 Okay, I'm seeing the difference in romantic stuff that you two say to your partners.

144
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,040
 Andy says, "I love you."

145
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,120
 And James says, "I'm having changes in my body that are helping me to procreate towards

146
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
 you right now."

147
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,880
 Can we say what some starfish do in exactly this?

148
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,880
 Now we're kind of on their love life.

149
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,200
 Have you heard of pseudo-copulation?

150
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
 Pseudo-copulation.

151
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
 Have I?

152
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,760
 That's all the copulation that I've ever done.

153
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,880
 I'm so glad we've reached, like, 70s comedian.

154
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,680
 It actually is quite like that because normally, or loads of species of starfish operacy, there

155
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,640
 are dozens and dozens, normally they release sperm and eggs near each other and they then

156
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,840
 meet up and you know, there's no sex as we understand it at all, but pseudo-copulation

157
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
 is kind of similar.

158
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,480
 So a male and a female, they form a pair and the male, quite sweetness, puts all his

159
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,840
 arms between the female's arms so they're kind of cuddled and then she releases eggs

160
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,280
 right there and he simultaneously releases all his sperm.

161
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,680
 So it's like a very intense cuddle, basically.

162
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
 Oh, okay.

163
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
 That's nice.

164
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,000
 Did you say that's how a particular species does it, sorry?

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,080
 It's how some species do it, yeah, not all of them.

166
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,960
 Do you guys happen to know, I'm only thinking of this because Andy's brought this up, but

167
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,920
 if you chop a starfish in half and it regenerates into a new starfish, does it carry the same

168
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,060
 age or does it start fresh?

169
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,680
 Because you know, they can live up to like 35 years roughly.

170
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,360
 I think they can start fresh because for some of them, that's actually how they procreate

171
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,560
 is just by dividing, even more sexless.

172
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
 That's what I mean.

173
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,520
 They don't need copulation really, they just lob an arm off and they're good.

174
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,440
 Well, they don't necessarily need it, but it's good for genetic diversity copulation.

175
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,240
 That's why I always say to my wife, so this will be good for the genetic diversity of our

176
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,040
 species darling.

177
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,040
 Oh, Valentine's Day for Mark and Elsa.

178
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,840
 There are some very cool versions.

179
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,000
 I think I really like the cushion starfish because it's not actually star shaped.

180
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,360
 If you look at it, it's like it forgot to sprout its lips/legs, it's just a pentagon

181
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
 really.

182
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,360
 And when it's young, it starts out as a pentagon and it just gets bigger and bigger and then

183
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,720
 it ends up as a big blob, like a cushion.

184
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
 That's nice.

185
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
 And it's quite nice.

186
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,560
 There are about 2,000 of them, 2,000 species and we're in dangerous times.

187
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,360
 So back in episode 45, James mentioned a thing which was the starfish wasting syndrome,

188
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,720
 which is this really horrible disease that has just been sweeping through the oceans and

189
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,760
 within hours of a starfish getting this disease, they are dying and they're dying in really

190
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
 weird ways.

191
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,360
 So as James mentioned, one of the arms sort of dislodges itself and just walks off into

192
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,560
 the distance.

193
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,160
 So they keep finding these arms everywhere, just laying on the seabed and then a completely

194
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,320
 gooey, yucky starfish that's just been eaten by this disease.

195
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,640
 And we are losing billions at a time at the moment.

196
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,600
 It's so huge, it's so bad.

197
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,000
 And as far as I can tell, the leading scientists who are trying to work out what's going on

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,480
 are studying it in a tank.

199
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,000
 And do you know where this tank is?

200
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,400
 It's in Star City, no, it's in the Madame Tussauds.

201
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,680
 It's in the Pentagon and it's got Pentagon starfish in it.

202
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
 Very nice.

203
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,680
 That's lovely.

204
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,800
 How are we supposed to know that?

205
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,760
 It's in one of those restaurants where you go and they've got all those lobsters sort

206
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,000
 of sad looking and lobsters hanging around and it's in there.

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 It's not that.

208
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 I'll give you a clue.

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 It's in the Mexican Aquarium where Free Willy was based.

210
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,140
 Oh, that's great.

211
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,400
 You were basically there.

212
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,600
 It is literally in a warehouse right behind the place where Keiko was held, where Free

213
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
 Willy was held.

214
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
 Holy shit.

215
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
 Oh my god, that was such a good guess.

216
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
 Yeah.

217
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
 That's great.

218
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,340
 Yeah, so they're studying them there and they've found a method which is kind of helping

219
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,800
 them but you can't get that into the oceans right now.

220
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
 It's insane.

221
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
 There's nothing we can do.

222
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
 But what's causing it?

223
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
 Is it?

224
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
 They think it's a bacteria.

225
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
 Is it?

226
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
 Yeah.

227
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
 But they don't actually know and James mentioned this close to 10 years ago and we're still

228
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
 none the wiser.

229
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
 It's ridiculous.

230
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,480
 What's the point of me bringing these subjects to light if they're not going to do anything

231
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
 in nine years?

232
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,840
 Honestly, you guys, listen back to episode 45, 46, 47.

233
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
 Yeah.

234
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,040
 I was always bringing up these really important things and everyone just ignored me, like

235
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
 Cassandra.

236
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
 Yeah.

237
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
 It's hard to know what to do about it, isn't it?

238
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,920
 As you're everyday man on the street, maybe we need a free starfish, you know, Free Willy

239
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
 sequel.

240
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,000
 Oh yeah, flinging it into the ocean, I don't know.

241
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,640
 Since 2013, five billion have died from this disease and they're down population wise by

242
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
 90%.

243
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
 It's mad.

244
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
 Oh my goodness.

245
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,800
 That's terrible.

246
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,880
 You can also eat starfish.

247
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
 Can you?

248
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
 Yes.

249
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,480
 Some places in the Far East do.

250
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,560
 There's a place called Qingdao where it's quite common that they eat starfish.

251
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,720
 I've seen a blog of people making them and eating them.

252
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,880
 What you do is you kind of break off the leg and then you open it up and then the meat

253
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
 is inside.

254
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,080
 And it looks like, if you can imagine a baby's nappy when they've first gone on to solids,

255
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,480
 it looks a bit like that.

256
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,760
 Why did you get fired as the restaurant menu description writer for this place, James?

257
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
 I don't know.

258
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,320
 I thought it was a visual way of describing it and apparently the taste is the same as

259
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,600
 a beach smells low tide.

260
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
 Right.

261
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
 Wow.

262
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,480
 They eat them in Qingdao, but to be honest, these days it's mostly a thing for tourists

263
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
 who got to Qingdao.

264
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,600
 The locals don't really eat anymore.

265
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,440
 If you ordered it for dinner and you ate sort of like three quarters of it and asked for it

266
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,680
 in a doggy bag, by the time you got home, would you have a full meal again?

267
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,840
 They leave footprints wherever they go.

268
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,320
 So very bad criminals.

269
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
 Lip prints.

270
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,520
 Lip prints.

271
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,520
 Sorry.

272
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
 Yes.

273
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,360
 This was actually an interesting study that I read about on a blog called the Echino blog.

274
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,280
 It's this guy called Christopher Ma, who calls himself the starfish guy.

275
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:10,520
 He's written multiple entries a month on just starfish for 10 years, stopped in 2018.

276
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,560
 So literally just hundreds and hundreds of entries just about starfish.

277
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,480
 And he reported that they don't have suction cups on their feet, which is what everyone

278
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,480
 always says.

279
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
 Yeah, right.

280
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
 They stick to things by suction.

281
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
 Yes.

282
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,160
 It's actually more like glue.

283
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,320
 So they have a fuzzy coat, what's called a fuzzy coat on each foot.

284
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,560
 They've got hundreds and hundreds of feet on each leg.

285
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,680
 So on each foot they've got a fuzzy coat and when that touches the ground, they push this

286
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,960
 kind of gluey film through it, which forms a mesh and that sticks them to the ground.

287
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,480
 And then when they lift their leg up again, they leave the fuzzy coat behind.

288
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,920
 And you can track a starfish across the sea floor if it's shop lifted because they leave

289
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,080
 these constant, every single one of their little suction things, leaves a little fuzzy

290
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
 coat behind.

291
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,040
 And then you have to take a lip print, which is quite sexy.

292
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,320
 You have an underground group who would do you Botox in your lips, like if you'd just

293
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,520
 a prime, they'd be able to hide.

294
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
 Like face off.

295
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
 Yeah.

296
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
 It's like face off, but just with lips.

297
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
 Lips off.

298
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
 Yeah.

299
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
 Lips off.

300
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
 Oh, and is it Travolta and Nicolas Cage?

301
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
 They have to swap lips.

302
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
 Just the lips.

303
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
 Just the lips.

304
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,520
 Yeah.

305
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,000
 I think I would watch that film if it was Mick Jagger and Michael Gove.

306
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Oh, yeah.

307
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,680
 Like you want two people with very different types of lips, don't you?

308
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
 Oh, yes.

309
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
 Yeah.

310
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,360
 And I mean, we are getting into the realm of a body swap comedy here, where Gove has

311
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
 to live as Jagger and vice versa.

312
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
 Yeah.

313
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,160
 It's weird, you say vice versa, because the body swap comedy genre, which includes what,

314
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,720
 like, Free Free Friday, all that stuff, it began in the 19th century with a book called

315
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
 vice versa.

316
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
 Oh.

317
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
 First ever one.

318
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
 Superb knowledge.

319
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,260
 Father and the son who swap places.

320
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,080
 And the story goes that Anthony Trollop was reading this book out to his friends, and

321
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,280
 he found a bit, which was so funny that he just got into a laughing fit and he died.

322
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
 No.

323
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
 Trollop died of laughing?

324
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
 I mean, no, he didn't really.

325
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
 Let's be clear on that.

326
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
 He did.

327
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
 He did.

328
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
 Well, he died of a stroke.

329
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,000
 He died of a stroke, which he had due to intense laughter, and he died a few weeks later.

330
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,640
 But I think that is true, actually.

331
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,640
 What?

332
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,640
 Hold on.

333
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
 He laughed intensely.

334
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,920
 And then he had a stroke immediately, and then he died a few weeks later.

335
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,920
 Sorry.

336
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,480
 It wasn't like he had a stroke a few weeks later, and they went, remember, when he laughed

337
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,600
 a couple of months ago, but it was that.

338
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
 That's a better story.

339
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
 Yeah.

340
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
 Yeah.

341
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,280
 Basically, Freaky Friday killed Anthony Trollop.

342
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
 Wow.

343
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,240
 Now, that's a fact.

344
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,840
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

345
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,680
 My fact this week is that one of the best times for Dracula to suck your blood is while

346
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,080
 you are watching a Dracula movie.

347
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
 Oh.

348
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
 No.

349
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,560
 Is that because it's so thrilling normally to watch a Dracula movie that you'll be distracted?

350
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,160
 Or is it because you're watching the Dracula movie, then if you see Dracula in your house,

351
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,840
 you think, oh, that's normal because it's happening on the TV, so it's happening here

352
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,080
 as normal as well.

353
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,880
 We stumbled into the confusion of the fact immediately, which is, do you mean the best

354
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,100
 time for Dracula or the best time for you?

355
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,240
 Because often what's good for a vampire is not good for the person the vampire is sucking

356
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
 on.

357
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,120
 Or is it mutually good for everyone?

358
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,640
 No, it's never good for the person being sucked unless they want to become a vampire,

359
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,080
 which often does happen within that world.

360
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,040
 But it's fantastic for Dracula.

361
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
 The fictional world.

362
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
 The fictional world.

363
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,480
 It's fantastic for Dracula himself because he loves blood, and your blood is at its thickest,

364
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,480
 or at least it's much thicker when you're watching a vampire movie, a horror movie, anything

365
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,640
 with scares in it.

366
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
 So.

367
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
 Okay, two things.

368
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
 Yeah.

369
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
 Does he like thicker blood?

370
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
 Exactly.

371
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,520
 Like if your milkshake gets too thick, you can't get it through the straw.

372
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,320
 Oh, great point.

373
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,080
 But if it's too thin, you send back your cup of milk, don't you?

374
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
 That's true.

375
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
 So maybe it's just right.

376
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,800
 And secondly, you said much thicker.

377
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,360
 It's presumably not so thick it can't get through your veins and arteries.

378
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
 It's like tar.

379
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
 Yeah, exactly.

380
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
 Okay.

381
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
 Yeah.

382
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,600
 No, it's just a bit thicker.

383
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,320
 So it's a nice meal for Dracula.

384
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,640
 This is a study that was done at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and basically they wanted

385
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,760
 to analyze blood samples from volunteers who had watched a horror movie, and then at another

386
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,320
 point watch a very distinctly very unfrightening movie, a documentary.

387
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,840
 And so what they did was they found two different movies to show them.

388
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,880
 They found the 2010 horror movie Insidious, which they showed to them.

389
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,480
 And then a week later, they showed them a very, as they call it, non-alarmic documentary

390
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,520
 called A Year in Champagne.

391
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,720
 What they found is that the people who sat through Insidious had high levels of the blood

392
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,920
 clotting protein, which is called Factor 8.

393
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,800
 Did you know that this is pretty unrelated to the subject of this fact?

394
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,880
 But Champagne in Russia now can only be called Champagne if it's made not in Champagne, if

395
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,960
 it's made in Russia.

396
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,720
 I think so everywhere else we're only allowed to call Champagne Champagne if it's made in

397
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,800
 the Champagne region.

398
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
 It's one of those.

399
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,760
 Whereas Russia has changed trademark laws so that it can only be if it's Russian Champagne.

400
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,840
 So if not in America as well, you're allowed to call whatever you want Champagne in America.

401
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,840
 Really?

402
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,480
 Yeah, because it was in the decision to call things Champagne, that rule, was in the Treaty

403
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
 of Versailles.

404
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,280
 And the Americans never ratified the Treaty of Versailles.

405
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,560
 They had their own treaty against the Germans.

406
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,560
 Sorry.

407
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,040
 Why are there being bolt-ons added to the Treaty of Versailles about Champagne nomenclature?

408
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,160
 I mean, shouldn't we be just focusing on, should we just fix on the water and the wars and

409
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,840
 bring that safely to a conclusion?

410
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,040
 I kind of feel like we're going quite a long way away from Danzbach to Dracula here.

411
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
 Yeah, fine.

412
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,440
 But yeah, basically it was because Germans were making sparkling wine as well.

413
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,320
 And also the Champagne region had been quite badly hit by the war.

414
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
 Vampires?

415
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
 Yeah.

416
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
 Can we talk about real vampires for a bit?

417
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
 Yeah, go on.

418
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
 But then proper...

419
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
 Not real.

420
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
 The people who live in the world are vampires.

421
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,320
 Oh, yeah.

422
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
 Sure.

423
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
 Yeah.

424
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
 So I was reading about them.

425
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,580
 Basically, most of them don't drink blood.

426
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:21,240
 There are a few, the Sanguinarians, but even they are really careful, obviously, because

427
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,200
 you can get all sorts of diseases from drinking blood.

428
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,460
 But I think the vast majority are apparently psychic energy drainers who go along to places

429
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,720
 and feel the energy at places like concerts and then suck the life force from that.

430
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,240
 But we all know people who, when you talk to them, you feel like you're having the life

431
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,640
 force suck from you.

432
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,200
 And I just thought those were boring people.

433
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,000
 But it turns out they might actually be vampires.

434
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Is that right?

435
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,880
 I think they also give massages.

436
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,720
 I think the idea is like, if you give someone a massage, you can suck up their energy from

437
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
 that.

438
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
 So rub it out of them.

439
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
 Wow.

440
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,240
 Well, also, if someone's going to suck away my psychic energy, then I want to be getting

441
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,280
 something in return for it, I guess.

442
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,560
 So a massage seems like a fair deal.

443
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
 That is a good deal.

444
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,320
 Let's reverse Reiki instead of putting your good energy into someone, you're taking it

445
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
 out.

446
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
 Oh, yeah.

447
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,320
 Reiki?

448
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
 OK.

449
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
 I don't really know Reiki.

450
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,320
 No, not really.

451
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,160
 We've got into some ropey territory here, haven't we?

452
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,400
 Some non-fact-based territory.

453
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
 Yeah, yeah.

454
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,720
 It's pseudoscience, but it's quite famous.

455
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
 Oh, sorry.

456
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,040
 Let's get back to vampires and sucking psychic energy.

457
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
 Yeah.

458
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,600
 Well, you do get fang smiths as well, people who make prosthetic fangs for other vampires.

459
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,960
 I read an interview with a bloke who's called Father Sebastian, so it's Sebastian, but with

460
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,680
 two As at the end in the final bit.

461
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,320
 It's very touching, actually, that he's a fang smith because his grandfather was an orthodontist.

462
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
 Oh.

463
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
 Really?

464
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,520
 And so he stayed in the family business, but he's just catering for a slightly more niche

465
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
 audience.

466
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,520
 Only makes canines, basically.

467
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
 Yeah.

468
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,400
 You can't do incisors, mate.

469
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
 Sorry.

470
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,120
 Real vampires refer to themselves sometimes as 'hemosexuals', which I find quite funny.

471
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
 That's nice.

472
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
 That's quite good.

473
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
 Apart from...

474
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,560
 It's not implied that you're attracted to blood, sexually.

475
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,280
 Well, and they're very clear that they're not attracted to blood, sexually.

476
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
 That's a completely different thing.

477
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,240
 Well, why do they call themselves 'hemosexuals'?

478
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,120
 It's a funny quip, all right?

479
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
 It's just a...

480
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,480
 Yeah, I like that they're doing themselves any favours of people thinking they're just

481
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
 people.

482
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
 No.

483
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,760
 So maybe it's a nickname coined from outside the vamp community, I don't know.

484
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,000
 They should focus really on the fact that we are in the minority as blood drinkers in

485
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 history, really, because there are just so many instances of people drinking blood, which

486
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,880
 I suppose makes sense.

487
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,080
 It was quite available, but it's always the blood of criminals, it seems to me.

488
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,920
 And so there's been this belief for thousands of years that blood drinking cured epilepsy.

489
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:50,120
 I don't know where that came from, but it's right from ancient Rome, and people would

490
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,480
 drink the blood of vanquished gladiators, or more commonly, they'd drink the blood of

491
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,680
 beheaded criminals.

492
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,400
 And this ran all the way up to, you know, 1500 years later.

493
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,400
 In fact, in 1860, there was a source that reported epileptics would still stand around

494
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,800
 the executioner's block in Alaskan islands with cups in hand, waiting for the blood to

495
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,920
 spew out so that they could drink it.

496
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,480
 It was always said that medically the blood that was best for curing epilepsy was the

497
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,160
 blood of criminals, which does seem quite convenient that it's also the blood that happens to be

498
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,480
 likely to flow from the executioner's block.

499
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,000
 Yes, that's true.

500
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,920
 I read one article on this subject, which I think made a good point, which is, if you

501
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:36,200
 see someone bleeding, God forbid they're bleeding to death, they're getting weaker

502
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,440
 and weaker as they lose the blood.

503
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,440
 And so it does kind of make logical sense that ingesting blood would make you stronger,

504
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,280
 and that's probably why people have done it for most of history.

505
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,280
 Right.

506
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
 Right.

507
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,640
 So if you see someone dying of loss of blood on the ground, should you hand over your arm

508
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,040
 and just let them gnaw on it until help comes?

509
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
 No.

510
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,160
 They're a very, very, very scary film, and it will clot fast enough that actually they'll

511
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,160
 be fine.

512
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,160
 Yeah.

513
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:09,240
 Or try and maybe put some pressure on the large veins, maybe try and stop the bleeding.

514
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
 Yeah.

515
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
 Hopefully there's two of you.

516
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,960
 So one of you can do the boo, and the other one can do the tourniquet.

517
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
 Oh, yeah.

518
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
 Oh, yeah.

519
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,840
 I'll just re-enact a Dracula film while I'm...

520
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
 Yes.

521
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,680
 Oh, one last thing, vampire bats.

522
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,760
 So they do, you know how we were talking at the top of this fact about how would Dracula

523
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,440
 prefer to have thicker blood, would that not be too thick?

524
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:37,280
 So vampire bats have a saliva that contains an enzyme which is called draculin, and it

525
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,360
 basically prevents blood clotting, so that when it releases this thing, it goes into

526
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,380
 the bloodstream, which means the blood can just all flow much quicker.

527
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,040
 So obviously directly named after Bram Stoker's creation.

528
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,160
 How did you pronounce it, then?

529
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
 Draculin.

530
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,720
 I think it's pronounced draculin, ah, ah, ah, ah, sorry.

531
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
 Yes.

532
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,960
 There's a silent "ha, ha, ha" in the writing here.

533
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,120
 But yeah, and so what they've worked out is if they can take this enzyme, and there's

534
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,320
 tests that have been going on, there may be new results, but from when I last read it,

535
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,720
 it was still in the research stage, it can be applied to help stroke victims by breaking

536
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,760
 down blood clots, and stroke is an anagram of Stoker.

537
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,560
 Dun, dun, dun, that is...

538
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,000
 Wow, you really beat that together.

539
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 I love it.

540
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,160
 I've got shivers down my spine and I can feel my blood thickening as you speak.

541
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,040
 It goes all the way to the top.

542
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:40,920
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

543
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:47,560
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1554, thousands of people in London were convinced that they

544
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:59,840
 heard an angel talking to them from behind a wall and slagging off the Queen.

545
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,920
 Sorry, is that what an angel would do, though, if it came down to her?

546
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:12,000
 Well, if the Queen was Queen Mary, Bloody Mary, who was doing terrible things in the

547
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,340
 name of religion, then you might do, I don't know.

548
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,160
 No, maybe you would as an angel.

549
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,600
 So yeah, that's spoiler alert, the Queen that I'm referring to, Bloody Mary, who was on

550
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,080
 the throne at the time, obviously lots of upheaval in Europe about Protestantism and Catholicism

551
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,880
 and stuff like that.

552
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:38,200
 The Queen was about to marry Philip, the second, I think, of Spain, and there were lots of

553
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,840
 people in England who weren't very happy about this because he was a big old Catholic, and

554
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,240
 so they tried to do whatever they could to stop it.

555
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,560
 One of the things would be to rouse up the rabble, and one of the ways that they thought

556
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,880
 to do this was to pretend that there was an angel in a wall, and the angel in question

557
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:02,580
 was a woman called Elizabeth Crofts, who, according to the Dictionary of National Biography,

558
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:08,720
 nothing is known of her before 1554, and nothing was heard of her after 1554.

559
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,320
 She just comes into history, does this amazing thing, and then disappears again.

560
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
 It's incredible.

561
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
 You've got a lot on, haven't you?

562
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
 Yeah.

563
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,760
 I read a blog by a history writer called Susan Abernethy, and she was saying that they believe

564
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:28,480
 she might have been born in 1535 because there's details written that she was of a certain age,

565
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,400
 and so they've just pieced it back that way.

566
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,760
 They believe that she was working in a house at the time as a maid, and so she was put behind

567
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
 this wall.

568
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,800
 She was given a whistle so that she could make weird whistling noises, and then she also

569
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,880
 began to speak sort of anti-Catholic propaganda, and people started calling her the angel or

570
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,400
 a bird that was in the wall.

571
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,020
 So it could have been a bird, is the other option, by the way.

572
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,640
 Still crazy if a bird is saying stuff about the Queen's forthcoming marriage.

573
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,600
 I would still stop on the street and listen to that, and they hid people in the crowd,

574
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,600
 unless it was Parrot Andy, who's going, "Parrot?

575
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
 Parrot?"

576
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
 Yeah, that's interesting.

577
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,320
 I'm sort of now wondering what I would stop on the street for, as in if a parrot was doing

578
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,500
 quite convincing sectarian propaganda.

579
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,840
 I would probably pause.

580
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,680
 But even if you're in a rush, you're five minutes late for the podcast already, we're

581
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,320
 going to have no sympathy if it's, "Oh, I stopped on the street because there's a parrot giving

582
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,080
 anti-Catholic propaganda."

583
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,560
 Yeah, if I was in a rush, I'd probably just sort of hope it would still be there when

584
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:34,240
 I came back the other way, which I think she was, wasn't she, Elizabeth Crosses?

585
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,680
 She had to be stuck in, I think she was in the wall sort of, like she was hidden inside

586
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
 the wall.

587
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,200
 Well, it was like a facade wall, yeah, that was put out in front of the main wall, I think,

588
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,800
 and she was sort of in between.

589
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,920
 And it lasted days.

590
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,040
 So yeah, did she sleep there?

591
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
 Did she go home?

592
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,800
 Was there a door in the other wall that she could go through?

593
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
 There must have been a way of getting her out.

594
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
 So many questions.

595
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,880
 I think the point though, Anna, is that it's saying it's a bird or an angel.

596
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,240
 That would be the debate, Andy would be going by and he would just have an opinion going,

597
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
 "What's obviously a parrot?"

598
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,920
 And they're saying, "No, we think it might be an angel."

599
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,320
 You know, there's mystery there.

600
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
 I see.

601
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,320
 I see.

602
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,440
 Well, we called up Ra in the end and they went to the mayor of London and the mayor

603
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,160
 of London said, "Well, why don't we just knock down the wall and see whether it's a bird

604
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,800
 or an angel or what?"

605
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,040
 And they knocked down the wall and sure enough, it was this woman, Elizabeth Crosses.

606
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,240
 This just reminds me so much of when I tanned essays in late and I just wouldn't have a plan

607
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,280
 for when the teacher said, "Where's your essay?"

608
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,520
 It's like, surely the people who know that there's a girl behind the wall are watching

609
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,800
 the demolition men knocking brick after brick and saying, "How are we going to deal with

610
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
 this?"

611
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
 Yeah.

612
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,560
 They should have put her in like either an angel or a parrot costume, shouldn't they?

613
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
 Yeah.

614
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
 Yeah.

615
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,560
 Exactly.

616
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
 Or a brick costume.

617
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
 Oh, brilliant.

618
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
 Yes.

619
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
 Oh, no.

620
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
 But that's dangerous.

621
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,840
 That's dangerous as someone comes in with a sledgehammer hitting bricks.

622
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
 You don't want to be dressed as a brick.

623
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,560
 But she can just say, "I'm a talking brick.

624
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,120
 I'm a magical talking brick who's got strong opinions about the Queen's religious faith."

625
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
 Yeah.

626
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,040
 You wouldn't dare destroy that, would you?

627
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
 No.

628
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,960
 You could just say sort of quickly the context like why is all that, I mean James you've

629
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,440
 already said a bit of it, but basically England had been through a right old nightmare in

630
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,680
 the previous decades where England was Catholic and then Henry VIII, Mary's dad broke with

631
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:19,040
 the church and dissolved the monasteries and then his son Edward VI took England even further

632
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:25,560
 away from the Catholic church and then he died aged about 16 and then Mary, his half-sister

633
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,760
 became Queen and she was very Catholic, you know.

634
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
 Dragged it back.

635
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:35,240
 I mean poor old Edward who always gets accused of introducing a very Protestant regime and

636
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,240
 the guy was nine.

637
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,240
 I mean there were just lots of old men behind him saying, "Say this now, I would say that."

638
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,720
 And the wall was very pro Queen Elizabeth, the future Queen Elizabeth.

639
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
 The wall?

640
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
 The wall.

641
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,080
 Yeah, the angel referred in the wall because they would cry out things like, "God save

642
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,440
 Queen Mary" and the wall would stay silent and then they'd say, "God save Lady Elizabeth"

643
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,560
 and the wall would say, "So be it."

644
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,680
 So they really wanted her to get into power because she would have kept it Protestant

645
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,000
 according to what they believed at the time.

646
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,160
 You know that Pink Floyd song, "Break in the Wall" is actually based on this incident

647
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
 in 1554.

648
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,160
 Yes.

649
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,320
 You know, you're just another "Break in the Wall" is addressed to Elizabeth Croft.

650
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:23,120
 And then what happened was because she was just a maid who don't need no education, she

651
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,200
 was let go basically, they decided that she must have been, there must have been other

652
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,120
 people behind it and must have been other people who talked her into it and probably

653
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,960
 she was just a pawn in their scheme and they let her go.

654
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,080
 I think she was in prison for a couple of weeks and then...

655
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:44,120
 Was she doing it for any money, which is of course another very famous Pink Floyd song?

656
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,560
 I hope she didn't suffer any brain damage as a result of the wall being broken in on.

657
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
 Is that another one?

658
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
 It is.

659
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
 I think it is, yeah.

660
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
 Yeah, anyway.

661
00:30:53,560 --> 00:31:01,120
 I always think it must be so awkward in the Tudor era when, as you say, there was Elizabeth,

662
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,920
 who was the daughter of Anne Boleyn, obviously, and then there was Protestant, and then there

663
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,840
 was Mary, who was very Catholic, and then there was Edward, who was Protestant.

664
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,640
 But they all hung out together as well.

665
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:15,360
 I mean, Mary was essentially sent away from the royal household when Henry divorced Catherine

666
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,720
 of Aragon, but then she was sort of brought back in a bit of a disgrace because she was

667
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,600
 Catholic, but brought back in, she's hanging out with Elizabeth, but at the same time,

668
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,960
 they both know that they're on opposite sides.

669
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
 They also...

670
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,380
 Elizabeth also lived with Lady Jane Gray, which I didn't realize, which for internationalists

671
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,800
 is as famous here as the Nine-Day Queen.

672
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
 And she's...

673
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,920
 She's the Liz Truss of the monarchy, isn't she?

674
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
 She's...

675
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,680
 Famous is such a generous way of putting it, Anna.

676
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,400
 I mean, Lady Jane Gray is not...

677
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,280
 We're not all going around talking about Lady Jane Gray today.

678
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
 She's pretty obscure.

679
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
 She's a huge celeb.

680
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,960
 Lady Jane Gray and the Kardashians are very much forefront of everyone's mind.

681
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,120
 No, okay, maybe she's famous in year 10 history classes.

682
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,320
 So basically, she was the Protestant, who Edward and the people behind Edward wanted

683
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,320
 on the throne.

684
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
 Right.

685
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,320
 And then Mary had her executed.

686
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,320
 Yeah.

687
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,320
 And then Mary had her executed.

688
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,360
 Which was kind of par for the course, because you've got to have the people who acclaimance

689
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
 to the throne...

690
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,360
 Yeah.

691
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,360
 You know, blah, blah, blah, blah.

692
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
 Yeah.

693
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
 I do...

694
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,600
 Mary, Queen Mary, Bloody Mary, has a really, really bad reputation, and I think a lot of

695
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,920
 it is a deeply inherited propaganda, as in you're just kind of assumed, "Oh, just that

696
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,040
 she was the awkward awful bit before Queen Elizabeth came in and sorted it all out."

697
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,140
 But her teenage years were really, I just think of how embarrassed you are as a teenager.

698
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:36,240
 And basically, firstly, your parents break up, okay, then your dad changes the entire

699
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,600
 religious structure of the country so that he can remarry.

700
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
 That must be tough as well.

701
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
 And then...

702
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
 Exactly.

703
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,400
 And then he annulls his marriage to your mum.

704
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:50,000
 So suddenly, your parents were never married, so now she's illegitimate, and you are downgraded

705
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,680
 from a princess to a lady.

706
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
 So I mean...

707
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
 Yeah, but she's always...

708
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,180
 It must have been very embarrassing.

709
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,160
 But whenever she's whinging about that, she's always got little sister Elizabeth there

710
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,480
 putting her hand up, going, "Uh, mate, our dad killed my mum."

711
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
 Yeah.

712
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
 Chopped her head off.

713
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
 So keep your mouth shut, love.

714
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,080
 But I read that she had to then become part of the sort of servant crew for Elizabeth.

715
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,580
 So she didn't even just get demoted.

716
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,160
 She was actively then sort of like, "Here's your breakfast."

717
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
 Little sister.

718
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
 Yeah.

719
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
 Yeah.

720
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
 Oh.

721
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,160
 Harsh.

722
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,440
 It is funny that she's remembered as Bloody Mary still now, even though that is anti-catholic

723
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
 propaganda, really.

724
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,640
 Or it's the fact that Protestantism or the Church of England won over.

725
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:35,520
 And also there was that very famous book, Fox's Book of Martyrs, that was...

726
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,080
 I mean, it's hard to underestimate how popular this book was.

727
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,160
 It was published in 1563, so shortly after Mary had died.

728
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,080
 And it was basically the book of all the great Christian martyrs who had died for their faith

729
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,080
 throughout time.

730
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,960
 And it ended with all of Mary's martyrs.

731
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,280
 So she killed about 260 people, I think, burned at the stake.

732
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,960
 And so this was a great piece of propaganda against Mary.

733
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,440
 But it sold like 150 million copies.

734
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
 No.

735
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
 Hang on.

736
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
 Hang on.

737
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,840
 That's greater than the world's population.

738
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,360
 It was over many hundreds of years.

739
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,780
 So for about 300 years, it was the best-selling book alongside the Bible.

740
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,400
 And it was so gory.

741
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,840
 I mean, there's got to be a reason it was so popular.

742
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,280
 And I think it was the amazing detail of how these people died.

743
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,200
 Like Anne Askew, do you know Anne Askew?

744
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,560
 Well, she called Anne Askew before she died, or did the Askew bit come after whatever happened

745
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,400
 to her?

746
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,040
 She was the first English woman ever to demand a divorce because she was Protestant.

747
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,440
 Her husband was Catholic.

748
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,240
 She didn't like that.

749
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,020
 And she refused to accept transubstantiation, so refused to believe that the bread was the

750
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,580
 body of Christ.

751
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,540
 And we should say of all these people, I think if they'd recounted, they wouldn't have been

752
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,540
 burned.

753
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,540
 Oh, yeah.

754
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,540
 It's their fault.

755
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
 Oh, take this.

756
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,540
 Take the side of Bloody Mary.

757
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,540
 Go on.

758
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,540
 Die, don't you?

759
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,540
 Show a bit of balance.

760
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,420
 She was put on the rack and stretched, which is always nice when you hear about one of

761
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,700
 these really sort of torture instruments you learn about at primary school being used.

762
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,400
 And she was stretched, and all of her limbs were dislocated.

763
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,680
 So that will make you Askew, I mean.

764
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,640
 She was right Askew, yeah, fitting.

765
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,760
 And then she was executed, and she had to be carried to the stake on a chair because she

766
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,640
 couldn't walk understandably, I imagine sort of flopping over this chair.

767
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
 Lovely.

768
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,520
 Yeah, so it's that kind of stuff you can see why it's a bestseller.

769
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,240
 Yeah, I think another, I mean, obviously the 200 years of propaganda in England defining

770
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,040
 itself specifically as being a non-Catholic country will have played into it, but I think

771
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,620
 another thing was that the burning at the stake, Elizabeth had loads of people executed.

772
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:44,580
 She had loads of religious heretics executed as well, but she tended to execute them as

773
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,660
 traitors instead of heretics.

774
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:51,140
 So it was seen as more of a political thing, or it's easier to write off as a political

775
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,380
 decision rather than Bloody Mary, the religious, you know, religious.

776
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:02,260
 I mean, Henry VIII, like what, 60,000 probably, compared to a few hundred for Bloody Mary.

777
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,720
 But yeah, they're just like, "Oh, well, they weren't birds at the stake.

778
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,720
 It wasn't heresy."

779
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,720
 So...

780
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,720
 Yeah, yeah.

781
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:13,480
 I was trying to think if, because I knew nothing about Mary and the Bloody Mary name.

782
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,880
 Is that where we get the name for the drink?

783
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,920
 I sort of had a quick look into that.

784
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,080
 Well, no, there's no idea.

785
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,360
 Lots of theories about what it could be.

786
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,360
 Bloody Mary is obviously one of them.

787
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,360
 She's included in there.

788
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,800
 There's a thought that it might be the Hollywood star Mary Pickford.

789
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,400
 But one of the main ones is that, and this is quite a famous bar called Harry's New York

790
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,060
 bar, which I, you know, weirdly is in Paris.

791
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,020
 But according to the manager...

792
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,380
 I'd run by a guy called Jeff.

793
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:45,460
 According to the manager, there used to be a cocktail waitress called Mary, who used

794
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:52,020
 to work in a Chicago bar called the Bucket of Blood, and supposedly it was that.

795
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,020
 Yeah.

796
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,020
 That's cool.

797
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,020
 We don't know.

798
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,140
 Yeah, probably after that rather than the really famous historical figure who was just

799
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,140
 called Bloody Mary.

800
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:03,720
 It is amazing all those cocktails because they're all within memory of people, you know, they're

801
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,320
 all within a couple of generations, but almost every cocktail, the name is lost to the mists

802
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,800
 of time, isn't it?

803
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,640
 It's because everyone's pissed, aren't they?

804
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,800
 As soon as they've invented it, no one can remember how it happened.

805
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:23,280
 I was looking up the sort of propaganda at the time, and it was the big age of the pamphlet.

806
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,200
 I kind of hope it comes back one day, the pamphlet, because it's a right old ass writing

807
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
 a book.

808
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,620
 Have you tried recently, James?

809
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,820
 Oh, yeah, I have actually.

810
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:38,380
 Anna and I, in fact, wrote everything to play for the QI Book of Spots, but, you know, far

811
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,380
 beyond from me.

812
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,980
 I just wrote a pamphlet version, which I think you incorporate into your larger book.

813
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,700
 But yeah, it's basically there was such good propaganda, pamphlets.

814
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,700
 I don't mean your book.

815
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:52,060
 I'm sure your book is scrupulously even-handed.

816
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,340
 You can print them in a couple of days.

817
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,100
 You can distribute them fast and cheap.

818
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,520
 It was like people having sub-stacks today.

819
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,160
 I found out this is slightly later.

820
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,320
 This is a later anti-Catholic document from 1624 called The Travels of Time, right?

821
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,240
 And it was printed, again, as a sort of regal monarchy commentary.

822
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,720
 So Charles I, who was seen as being quite pro-Catholic, was going to marry the Spanish

823
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,840
 Infanta, which was a princess, not an infant.

824
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,840
 I mean, given the time, she might also have been eight, but I don't know.

825
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:30,060
 But the marriage collapsed and people printed, I find this so, again, it's quite gossipy,

826
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,940
 but they just printed these pamphlets to celebrate the collapse of the marriage, the prospective

827
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,540
 marriage between the two of them.

828
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,820
 And again, if people were doing that about me, I'd be hurt.

829
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,660
 But there were all these allegorical images.

830
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,660
 That was a huge thing.

831
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,900
 And people got all the allegories in these pamphlets.

832
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,860
 So one of the images in this pamphlet showed the Spanish ambassador to England, Don Diego

833
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:53,120
 Samiento de Akuma Gondemar, using his buttocks to incubate locust eggs.

834
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:58,200
 And that was an acceptable political point to make at the time.

835
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
 That is quite good though.

836
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,080
 What's the political, hold on, what do the locust eggs represent?

837
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,280
 Is that the spawn of the devil?

838
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,680
 I think they might represent papacy, popism, you know, that kind of stuff.

839
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,680
 And it was incredibly rude.

840
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,440
 This is quite an obscure historical paper, I found this then, because he was, and I'm

841
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,780
 quoting here, the renowned sufferer of an anal fistula.

842
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,780
 So it was especially funny to show him with locust eggs in his bum.

843
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,780
 Ouch.

844
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,780
 I know.

845
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,780
 That's a tough one.

846
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,720
 What a terrible part of your bio that gets used for, like, chat shows.

847
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,620
 Famous sufferer of anal fistula.

848
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:39,420
 He prefers to talk about Anglo-Spanish diplomacy, but of course, we know he's Mr. Fistula.

849
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,820
 Welcome to the stage.

850
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:47,600
 Mr. Fistula does sound like quite a good music hall name for someone, does it?

851
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
 Yeah.

852
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:55,320
 Until 1910, when you became king or queen, you had to swear that you repudiated Catholicism

853
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,160
 as superstitious and idolatrous.

854
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,560
 Isn't that amazing?

855
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,220
 Until the 20th century, you had to do that.

856
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:08,520
 And then Edward VII said, Edward VII did do it, but he insisted on whispering the words,

857
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,100
 because he thought it would be an insult to any Catholics who were living in the country

858
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,100
 at the time.

859
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,100
 It does sound like it was.

860
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,100
 Yeah.

861
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,820
 Who were famously hard of hearing, weren't they?

862
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:28,620
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

863
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:34,460
 My fact this week is that this year, a woman was injured when she was attacked twice.

864
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:39,920
 Once by a five-foot-long snake that fell from the sky, then immediately afterwards by the

865
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,880
 hawk that dropped it.

866
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,160
 This was really some idol maternity leave reading, actually.

867
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,640
 I think I read it in the week.

868
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,760
 It's just the most incredible story.

869
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,720
 It's a woman called Peggy Jones in Texas who was mowing her lawn, and a large snake fell

870
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
 out of the sky.

871
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,440
 Her husband estimated later that it was 4.5 feet long, which is large, and it wrapped

872
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,640
 itself around her arm.

873
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,520
 I'm kind of imagining, you know those things that you used to slap your arm with as a kid,

874
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,020
 and they wrapped around them.

875
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,020
 They'd wrap around, yeah.

876
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,020
 Yeah, I'm sort of imagining it did that as it fell, and she tried to shake it off, and

877
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:18,500
 it got tighter and tighter, and the hawk that had been carrying the snake in its mouth plunged

878
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,540
 down and started attacking it to try and get the snake back, and they both managed to

879
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:27,060
 inflict multiple injuries, so the hawk was flying at her and grabbing for the snake and

880
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:32,620
 slapping her with its wings and clawed these deep cuts in her arm.

881
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:37,440
 The snake, meanwhile, was striking her in the face and chipping her glasses, and apparently

882
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,920
 spewing a liquid.

883
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,620
 And I love her husband, Wendell, got to her by riding over on his mower.

884
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,620
 Yeah, I'm imagining.

885
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,620
 Oh wow.

886
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,620
 Hurry up, Wendell!

887
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,620
 Go into fifth gear!

888
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,120
 What a scene.

889
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:58,200
 So she's one of the first people to have been involved in a snake and bird incident since

890
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:05,380
 just two years ago when Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson was, I mean it was a minor celebrity

891
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,500
 story, he was temporarily barricaded in his home because there was a snake right outside

892
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,700
 his front door, which was busy being eaten by a large hawk, which was busy eating the

893
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,700
 snake.

894
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,620
 And whenever he kind of got near it, it was threatening and flapping at him.

895
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,620
 Wow.

896
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,120
 Miner celebrity.

897
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,240
 Probably one of the highest paid actors on earth.

898
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,280
 Sorry, I don't mean to call him a minor, I mean the story is a minor story about a major

899
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,180
 celebrity, but I think we can all agree it's not one of the main things in his life, this

900
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,180
 story.

901
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,180
 What a rowback.

902
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:40,180
 I just don't want to smell what he's cooking, and I'm very happy to say he's a big deal,

903
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,180
 you know?

904
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,980
 He's in "Jumanji" for heaven's sake, the new one, not the original.

905
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,100
 The new one, by the way, which has a body swap part in it, which reminds me of an old

906
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:53,060
 book called "Ice Person".

907
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:58,640
 Several attacks, they happen way more than I realized, as in if you just do a new search,

908
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,520
 there are multiple stories globally that are just pumped out every single day.

909
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,320
 So just 24 hours ago, when I was, you know, looking at these facts, an Australian farmer,

910
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,480
 he described himself to the BBC and other outlets as "lucky to be alive" after repelling

911
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,160
 a crocodile by biting the crocodile back.

912
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:23,940
 So he found his face leaning against the crocodile's head, and he bit the eyelid of the crocodile,

913
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,180
 making the crocodile freak out, it let go of its bite, and he was able to escape, but

914
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:33,180
 it was only by biting the crocodile back that he was able to get out there.

915
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,180
 So many news articles.

916
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:38,900
 Look, this is literally the last three days, "Arizona Woman", fatally trampled by elk,

917
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:43,540
 she might have been trying to feed, "Pornstar's Pet Python", "Bite's Partner's Penis" and

918
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,540
 "Horocene", "Blood Everywhere".

919
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:51,060
 Yeah, I mean, the animal world is famously dangerous, Dan, but on things that you don't

920
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,280
 expect to attack you, I think of otters.

921
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,960
 Well, otters, I think, are the cutest animals alive.

922
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,840
 And so I was very surprised about an otter attack on someone called Lea Hillier.

923
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,560
 This was a few years ago, and it's really incredible that it was in Minnesota on this

924
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,920
 remote lake, and she always went for a swim in the lake, she was staying at her dad's

925
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,780
 lake house with her kids, always went for a swim in the lake, she swam a mile a day,

926
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,900
 felt one day something bite her leg, and then about 20 feet away, really quickly, an otter

927
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:27,300
 bobbed its head up, and then it kept swimming back to her leg and biting her leg again,

928
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,340
 and then swimming away and then bobbing its head up and looking at her.

929
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:36,500
 And it bit her 25 times, and like properly, it pierced her ankle bone, it pierced through

930
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:43,900
 her calf muscle, just an otter, and she was screaming for help, and her dad, her poor dad

931
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:48,120
 had heard these screams and tried to start the motorboat to get to her, and in his panic,

932
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,760
 he flooded the engine of the motorboat, and he also had to get the kids, she had two kids

933
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,800
 who were two and four, so he had to get the kids on the boat, so he got another boat started,

934
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:03,760
 got out to her, dragged these poor kids' blood drenched mother out of the water, and the

935
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,640
 maddest thing for me is she got out of the water, got to hospital, was given a rabies

936
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,160
 shot in every single one of the 25 bites, which made her vomit.

937
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,940
 Two weeks later, she got back in the lake.

938
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:20,060
 The otter's still in it, the otter's just there, bobbing away, which I feel like I wouldn't

939
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,060
 go swimming again.

940
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,060
 That's bullseye.

941
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:28,460
 You see a few otter stories of them attacking people, there was a minor celebrity story,

942
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:33,180
 and I actually will say this is about a minor celebrity, an actor called Crystal Finn, who

943
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,820
 was in succession, but one of the quite minor characters in succession, I'm sure she's an

944
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:42,500
 amazing actor, but I'd never heard of her before, she got beaten on her backside and

945
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:47,360
 on her leg this year by otters, there was a guy called Graham George Spencer, who was

946
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:53,220
 bitten 26 times in 10 seconds by otters, isn't that amazing?

947
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,420
 Was that multiple otters?

948
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,600
 It was a pack of otters, yeah.

949
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,280
 I don't know what the record is for the world's fastest draw, but that would be up there.

950
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:07,000
 His friend ran over screaming to try and scare off the otters, and they swam away, but then

951
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,460
 the pair said they ran towards the visitor centre to get help, still pursued by the

952
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,460
 otters.

953
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,460
 Oh no.

954
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:17,700
 Exit pursued by an otter.

955
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,540
 I was reading an article about why animals don't attack us more than they already do,

956
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:25,060
 and obviously, most of the time, when animals attack humans, it's because we're in their

957
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:30,540
 space, or because they're protecting their young nearby, or because we're on their territory.

958
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:35,460
 Because we're bipedal, we look bigger, we don't look bigger than we are, but we look

959
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,120
 bigger than we would if we were on all fours.

960
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,440
 That's kind of a little bit of a bluff.

961
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,080
 It makes us look a bit tougher, and also, it does mean we're slower.

962
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,000
 You can't outrun a cat.

963
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,120
 That's kind of maybe perceived as a bit of a show of strength.

964
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,320
 I don't need to be able to outrun a cat because I'm so tough.

965
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,960
 That's risky, isn't it?

966
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,960
 I don't know if that's...

967
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:05,040
 That way, your MMA career is going so well, indeed, because you're like, "I'm so good

968
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,040
 at MMA.

969
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,420
 I don't even have to work out.

970
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,140
 I don't have to get buff.

971
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,300
 I don't have to be strong-looking."

972
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,300
 Yeah.

973
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,740
 No one has ever turned up to a fight with me in the MMA ring because they're so terrified

974
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:20,980
 of this quite average-looking bloke who seems to have done no exercise.

975
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,980
 Yeah.

976
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,820
 I'm always really skeptical about the older, "Make yourself look bigger by putting your

977
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:25,820
 arms out."

978
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:29,780
 I guess it must be true because it does work, but it is like, are bears blind?

979
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,580
 Can they not see that once we put our arms out?

980
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,120
 It's just two small spindly things sticking out of us.

981
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,160
 Why do they suddenly go, "Oh my God, he's absolutely massive?"

982
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,960
 I've never noticed before.

983
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,440
 If you're bipedal, you're bigger looking to something that's looking at you from the

984
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:53,400
 side, but worms probably think we're smaller than we are because from a worms-eye view,

985
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,080
 if we were on our old foes, we'd be much bigger.

986
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,080
 Yeah.

987
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,080
 And hawks, actually.

988
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,680
 Maybe this one was attacked by a hawk because...

989
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,680
 That's true.

990
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,900
 They're gone for hawks, actually, rather than worms.

991
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,900
 No, I like worms.

992
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,900
 I think that's good.

993
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,900
 That's why you get so many worm attacks in these days.

994
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,900
 They cover them up.

995
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,900
 You do.

996
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:12,900
 We just wouldn't know.

997
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,900
 Worms are attacking us all the time.

998
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,900
 We've just got no idea.

999
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,500
 Just headbutting us for a bill.

1000
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:21,580
 The Hitchcock film, The Worms, was a complete commercial and critical flop, wasn't it?

1001
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,740
 You know, Aeschylus.

1002
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,260
 So we mentioned before, ancient Greek playwright who was killed when a bird dropped a tortoise

1003
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,260
 on his head.

1004
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,260
 Oh, yeah.

1005
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:35,640
 So what the idea was that the hawks dropped turtles on rocks to open them up so they can

1006
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,640
 eat the delicious turtle inside, and they thought his head was a rock because he was

1007
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,640
 so bald.

1008
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,640
 That was the claim.

1009
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,640
 That is the claim.

1010
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,640
 Yeah.

1011
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,480
 So I just sort of looked him up because I don't think we mentioned anything really

1012
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,840
 more about him at the time, just he was an ancient Greek playwright.

1013
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,800
 And so I found out this about him.

1014
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,680
 There is a theory that he invented people talking to each other on stage.

1015
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,680
 Oh.

1016
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,260
 He was a pretty early dramatist.

1017
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,120
 And this is a claim by Aristotle.

1018
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,820
 So you know, pinch of salt and some earlier sources will have been lost, blah, blah, blah.

1019
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:11,540
 But Aristotle claims that basically he invented characters who had conflict between each other.

1020
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:15,020
 And before that, characters could only speak to the chorus, and everyone was speaking to

1021
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,860
 the chorus and not to each other on stage.

1022
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,860
 What an innovation.

1023
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:19,860
 What a moment.

1024
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,980
 Yeah, that must have been huge.

1025
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,180
 And if he hadn't come up with that, we would still all have to be talking to the chorus.

1026
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,180
 Everything would be to the chorus.

1027
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,180
 Yeah.

1028
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,180
 Yeah.

1029
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,100
 It's hard to have invented the chorus element first, though, because it seems less of it.

1030
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,560
 Because in normal life, it's not like when I chat to someone, it's always mediated by

1031
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,400
 a group of 12 people singing annoying songs.

1032
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,840
 I just do it direct.

1033
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,840
 It's quite odd, isn't it?

1034
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,760
 No, but then maybe that's what separated it as fantasy from real life.

1035
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,480
 Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to tell the difference, maybe.

1036
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,560
 He's like Ricky Gervais inventing the office.

1037
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,120
 Suddenly, sitcom is just...

1038
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:56,600
 Eucalus, the Ricky Gervais of his time.

1039
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,620
 Back to snakes that have been attacking people.

1040
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:06,100
 I read a story about a guy who's called Valentin Grimaldo from Texas.

1041
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,580
 A coral snake came up and bit him on his hand.

1042
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,780
 He grabbed the snake.

1043
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:18,180
 He bit its head off and then used the snake as a band around his arm to cut off.

1044
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,180
 No.

1045
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,180
 Yeah.

1046
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,180
 Like what they call the tonic.

1047
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,180
 Tonic.

1048
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,180
 Yeah.

1049
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,180
 Yeah.

1050
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,300
 He used that around his arm and then they went off to the hospital's emergency room and

1051
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,300
 he was fine.

1052
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,360
 He's still got the head as a keepsake.

1053
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,520
 Wow.

1054
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,520
 That's really ignominious.

1055
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,520
 That's wild.

1056
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,520
 That's a snake, isn't it?

1057
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,520
 How embarrassing.

1058
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,520
 You know dragons.

1059
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,520
 Sure.

1060
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,520
 Yeah.

1061
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,520
 Not real.

1062
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,360
 There is a theory and I think it is a true theory that basically dragons are just sexed

1063
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,360
 up snakes.

1064
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,520
 To what extent is it true theories, Ori?

1065
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,720
 I think it's true.

1066
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,760
 I think when you look at like people writing about dragons, especially in the Middle Ages,

1067
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:58,820
 they start off being these worm-like creatures with no legs that have stripes on their body

1068
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,220
 and forked tongues.

1069
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:05,100
 And then as the Middle Ages progresses to the Renaissance, they just become more and

1070
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:09,820
 more fantastical that they can fly and breathe fire and stuff like that.

1071
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:15,940
 And so what we reckon is because the kind of story started off in the Southern Europe

1072
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:21,680
 and Egypt and whatever where there were plenty of snakes and then they came up into Europe

1073
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,340
 where there weren't so many snakes.

1074
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,800
 People just started adding stuff because they didn't know what snakes were like really.

1075
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,240
 In the Iliad, the original or the earliest version of the Iliad that we have, it says

1076
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:36,920
 that the dragon could be eaten by eagles, which obviously the modern day dragon, you

1077
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,040
 would not be possibly to do that.

1078
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,040
 No.

1079
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,440
 Bizarrely, on an earlier fact, I had to think about the Odyssey, which I didn't say.

1080
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,300
 Which is that the Odyssey features the first appearance in literature of black pudding.

1081
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,300
 Oh, does it?

1082
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,980
 It was about people eating blood.

1083
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,180
 I think that was why I was on that tangent.

1084
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,180
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1085
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:54,380
 It's a sort of goatee blood sausage that they have and it is clearly a black pudding.

1086
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,380
 Oh, wow.

1087
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,380
 And that's in the Odyssey.

1088
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,780
 What's the bigger innovation, do you think, Andy, the introduction of black pudding or

1089
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,740
 chatting to each other on stage?

1090
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,740
 Interesting.

1091
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:02,740
 Gosh.

1092
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,740
 They're both massive, aren't they?

1093
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,040
 They're both huge deals, but in such different spheres of endeavour.

1094
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,260
 I reckon most people on Earth could say they could live without one.

1095
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,360
 I could live without black pudding.

1096
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,360
 That's the one I think, Anna, is.

1097
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:19,040
 No, no, no, I think some people would say they could live without drama but not black

1098
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,040
 pudding.

1099
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,600
 You know, I'm sure there are people in the people.

1100
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,600
 In the North.

1101
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,040
 Yeah, say it, Anna, people in the North.

1102
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:32,720
 It was actually, it was going to go as far as Scotland, in fact, in my stereotyping.

1103
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,120
 Do we still get Coronation Street and black pudding?

1104
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,120
 Can we say that at least?

1105
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,240
 You can get Coronation Street, but everything is mediated through the character of Emma

1106
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,460
 Elsie Tanner, who plays the chorus.

1107
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,460
 Yeah.

1108
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:49,620
 Speaking of snakes, have you guys ever seen, and I address this mainly to Dan, a documentary

1109
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:53,700
 on the Discovery Channel in 2014 called Eaton Alive?

1110
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:59,980
 Is this where the guy decided to be eaten by a snake and ingested?

1111
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:00,980
 I knew you know about him.

1112
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,980
 Yeah.

1113
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,980
 Well, because he went in the wrong way, I think, is the story.

1114
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:03,980
 He went in head first.

1115
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,980
 He went in first.

1116
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:05,980
 Oh, sorry.

1117
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:09,140
 He didn't crawl up the snake's arse.

1118
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,140
 Sorry.

1119
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:13,680
 I've gone in the wrong way, guys.

1120
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:24,960
 It's such a mad, stupid thing to do, and Paul Rosalie was his name, and he, first of all,

1121
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,360
 he was on an expedition in the Amazon to find the biggest anaconda there was, a biggest

1122
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,600
 green anaconda there was.

1123
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,600
 Yeah, cool.

1124
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,600
 He'd heard tell that existed.

1125
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,600
 It would be over 24 feet long.

1126
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,600
 It would be the world's longest.

1127
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,880
 And once he got there, he was going to let it eat him.

1128
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,880
 And this--

1129
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,580
 Was there a day that he was in a sleeping bag or something, or that he was in some kind

1130
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,460
 of sack, which he could then wriggle out of?

1131
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:47,380
 He wore a special suit so he could survive it, and then he was going to be extracted

1132
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,380
 from the snake.

1133
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,380
 So he wouldn't be digested, yeah.

1134
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,380
 And--

1135
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,380
 Did he go into the--

1136
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,380
 He totally screwed up.

1137
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:56,620
 So first of all, he didn't find the big anaconda, so he had to be supplied with a 20-foot one

1138
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,420
 from a zoo.

1139
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:03,060
 Then he had this suit, which they drenched in pig's blood, to make the snake want to

1140
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,060
 eat him.

1141
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,060
 Yeah, yeah.

1142
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:08,960
 And then he said, he saw the snake's mouth open, everything went black, I think his head

1143
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,720
 went into the snake, his shoulders maybe went into the snake.

1144
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,840
 What about his knees and toes?

1145
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,820
 And then he was a starfish, so it became very confusing.

1146
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:23,680
 That is going to be a real-- when I listen back to that edit and see which of us got

1147
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,120
 it burst with that one, it was a real--

1148
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,120
 Photo finish.

1149
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,120
 Yeah.

1150
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:32,360
 So wait, sorry, his head went into the snake and everything went black.

1151
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,360
 How mysterious.

1152
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,360
 Yeah.

1153
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,580
 So then, yeah, then what?

1154
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,580
 I mean, I think he--

1155
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,580
 Well, then, yeah.

1156
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,580
 He tapped out.

1157
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:43,500
 The snake started twisting his body and started wrenching his arm around a bit, and he suddenly

1158
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:48,740
 thought, oh, this hurts, my arm's hurting, and started shouting to the technical assistants,

1159
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,220
 can you get me out now, please?

1160
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,100
 He wasn't on his own, so he was shouting from inside the snake, get me out, I'm done.

1161
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,940
 And so they managed to extract him from the snake.

1162
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:57,940
 Wow.

1163
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,940
 Yeah.

1164
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:01,220
 Did he shout, I'm a minor celebrity, get me out of here?

1165
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:04,720
 He's not the rock.

1166
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,880
 He said it was all to raise awareness about the plight of wildlife in the Amazon, about

1167
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,520
 which there's some skepticism from me.

1168
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,000
 Well, he just has, because now we've got some message.

1169
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 No one's coming away from this podcast thinking, oh, the plight of animals in the Amazon, that's

1170
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 why I remembered.

1171
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:29,080
 They're thinking idiot shoved his head in a snake.

1172
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,200
 OK, that's it.

1173
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,200
