00:00:13,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:19,00:00:22,to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:22,00:00:27,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and"
00:00:27,00:00:31,Anna Tyshinski and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite
00:00:31,00:00:37,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:40,"Starting with fact number one, that is Andy."
00:00:40,00:00:45,My fact is that for years scientists thought Starfish had no heads.
00:00:45,00:00:49,It now turns out they have no bodies.
00:00:49,00:00:51,[Laughter]
00:00:51,00:00:52,Wow.
00:00:52,00:00:53,All head.
00:00:53,00:00:54,"Or even the arms heads, no."
00:00:54,00:00:55,Yeah.
00:00:55,00:00:59,I think what this shows is that it's actually quite hard to describe Starfish in terms of
00:00:59,00:01:00,human anatomy.
00:01:00,00:01:01,Yeah.
00:01:01,00:01:02,[Laughter]
00:01:02,00:01:06,So what's the difference between head and body according to this definition?
00:01:06,00:01:07,Okay.
00:01:07,00:01:11,This is the result of a new study from Stanford University and I think maybe one or two other
00:01:11,00:01:12,places.
00:01:12,00:01:17,And it's about the genetic code that sort of programmes Starfish because Starfish are
00:01:17,00:01:23,"really, really weird bodily as in they start out with bilateral symmetry, which is what"
00:01:23,00:01:27,"humans have as in you've got two sides, you've got a left and a right and it's sort of the"
00:01:27,00:01:28,"same, you know, you're mirrored."
00:01:28,00:01:32,So Starfish start out like that when they're first born and then they kind of grow out
00:01:32,00:01:35,of it and they become the starfish shape that we know.
00:01:35,00:01:40,"And so what this study is, it looked at the genetic code which kind of programmes head"
00:01:40,00:01:47,"like territory and it turns out that they have that in each of their arms and the middle,"
00:01:47,00:01:51,"the middle bit, which joins all the arms together, has more head like genetics."
00:01:51,00:01:55,Not one bit of the starfish contains the genetic programme which we associate in our
00:01:55,00:01:57,own bodies with a trunk or a torso.
00:01:57,00:01:59,"Are they one entity or the arms, mini heads?"
00:01:59,00:02:00,Okay.
00:02:00,00:02:02,So it's not like one big orbiting head?
00:02:02,00:02:04,It's a bit like that.
00:02:04,00:02:11,"Like we used to think it was imagine your body, but then we cut off your head and so you're"
00:02:11,00:02:14,just the middle with some arms and legs sticking out.
00:02:14,00:02:18,But now what it turns out is imagine someone took off your arms and legs and super glued
00:02:18,00:02:19,them to your head.
00:02:19,00:02:20,That's it.
00:02:20,00:02:24,"Although, I read, and I don't know if this is one of the guys involved in the study,"
00:02:24,00:02:29,"a biologist called Thurston Lakali, which is just a really cool name."
00:02:29,00:02:33,He said we should be thinking of them as a disembodied head walking about the sea floor
00:02:33,00:02:35,on its lips.
00:02:35,00:02:38,So are you saying the legs are the lips?
00:02:38,00:02:39,Legs.
00:02:39,00:02:45,"Well, yeah, kind of, except that also Dan, in this example where we've removed your arms"
00:02:45,00:02:49,"and legs, we've also super glued your anus to the back of your head."
00:02:49,00:02:51,"So yes, you are walking out of your mouth too."
00:02:51,00:02:55,"Dan, you're becoming more and more attractive by the minute."
00:02:55,00:02:58,"Please fan art, send to Andy."
00:02:58,00:03:03,"Basically, what the main headline is is that there's no way for a starfish to sing the"
00:03:03,00:03:05,"song head, shoulders, knees and toes."
00:03:05,00:03:08,There's just no analogy for that.
00:03:08,00:03:11,"That's his head, head, head, lips, feet."
00:03:11,00:03:12,Anus.
00:03:12,00:03:13,Anus.
00:03:13,00:03:15,"Anus, head, head, lips and feet."
00:03:15,00:03:16,Lips and feet.
00:03:16,00:03:17,Amazing.
00:03:17,00:03:18,That's incredible.
00:03:18,00:03:23,"Is this why they have that feature that I think we must have mentioned before, where"
00:03:23,00:03:29,even if you cut off the main circular bit that looks like a body to us and just are
00:03:29,00:03:34,"left with a leg, they can regrow and regenerate their entire self from just a leg."
00:03:34,00:03:35,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:35,00:03:39,Maybe is that related to the fact that each leg actually has this genetic head material
00:03:39,00:03:41,in it that can sprout everything.
00:03:41,00:03:42,Yeah.
00:03:42,00:03:43,And you.
00:03:43,00:03:44,But it's a cool thing to be able to do anyway.
00:03:44,00:03:47,Imagine someone just cutting all of your body off except your finger and then your finger
00:03:47,00:03:48,grow a whole new body on it.
00:03:48,00:03:49,It's mental.
00:03:49,00:03:50,It's absolutely crackers.
00:03:50,00:03:55,"The regeneration thing is insane because as you say, like a tiniest bit can be chopped"
00:03:55,00:04:00,off and they can grow into a whole new starfish and that's really messed up a lot of fishermen
00:04:00,00:04:01,back in the day.
00:04:01,00:04:05,So there's areas of the world where they would eat the local oyster population.
00:04:05,00:04:07,This is the starfish and they were depleting it.
00:04:07,00:04:10,"So what fishermen used to do is when they got a starfish out, they'd kill it and they'd"
00:04:10,00:04:14,kill it by slashing it into two or five or whatever and then just chucking them back into
00:04:14,00:04:20,"the ocean, not realizing they were creating a giant army of starfish."
00:04:20,00:04:22,Like what I imagine the gremlins were if I ever watched that movie.
00:04:22,00:04:24,Is that what happens?
00:04:24,00:04:26,You put water on them and they all double in.
00:04:26,00:04:27,Is that what happens when they multiply?
00:04:27,00:04:28,I can't remember.
00:04:28,00:04:29,I haven't seen it.
00:04:29,00:04:30,"Guys, what are you?"
00:04:30,00:04:31,What are you?
00:04:31,00:04:32,"Yeah, of course."
00:04:32,00:04:33,"Dan, I'm really disappointed in you."
00:04:33,00:04:34,Sorry.
00:04:34,00:04:37,Do the gremlins get chopped up into smaller pieces and then create more gremlins?
00:04:37,00:04:40,"If you put water on them, they multiply."
00:04:40,00:04:42,"If you feed them after midnight, they become evil."
00:04:42,00:04:44,"If you expose them to sunlight, they die."
00:04:44,00:04:46,How many anuses do they have?
00:04:46,00:04:49,That is very vexed doctrine.
00:04:49,00:04:52,There is a big debate among us gremlin heads.
00:04:52,00:04:57,There's an amazing thing that they do as well when they're eating.
00:04:57,00:05:00,Starfish will basically send their stomach to go and get the meal.
00:05:00,00:05:05,"So say if they're eating something like there's a thing called the sand dollar, which is quite"
00:05:05,00:05:11,"a flat little species and you find it on the floor of the ocean, they'll send their stomach"
00:05:11,00:05:17,"out, they'll surround it and they'll melt down the body of it into the food, bring it"
00:05:17,00:05:19,back in and just leave the skeleton.
00:05:19,00:05:20,You know what?
00:05:20,00:05:26,"If we did that, then probably the job of delivering a screwdriver would be quite bad."
00:05:26,00:05:29,My delivery screwdriver is don't stick around and watch me eat my meal.
00:05:29,00:05:33,"Yeah, but you'll have to because instead of you coming to the door, your stomach would"
00:05:33,00:05:38,"come to the door and when they handed you the food, your stomach would kind of envelope"
00:05:38,00:05:42,around the bag of Chinese takeaway.
00:05:42,00:05:44,Leaving only the plastic Tupperware behind.
00:05:44,00:05:47,I can't believe yours don't watch you eat Anna.
00:05:47,00:05:52,"Maybe I'm tipping generously enough that they do, but they always stick around through"
00:05:52,00:05:53,the letterbox.
00:05:53,00:06:00,"What interesting thing about this stomach inside out thing is that you know oxytocin,"
00:06:00,00:06:02,they call it the love chemical.
00:06:02,00:06:08,"Very important in childbirth, it's like what stimulates a lot of changes in the body when"
00:06:08,00:06:10,you have a baby and stuff like that.
00:06:10,00:06:12,"I think I want to go on about it, don't they?"
00:06:12,00:06:18,"Oh my God, lights and scented candles, play some music, oh that'll get your oxytocin"
00:06:18,00:06:19,going.
00:06:19,00:06:23,"Literally, if you ever go to one of those things where they teach you how to be a parent, if"
00:06:23,00:06:27,"they ask you any question, just say oxytocin and that is always the answer, doesn't matter"
00:06:27,00:06:28,what it is.
00:06:28,00:06:29,"But anyway, not if you're a starfish."
00:06:29,00:06:34,"If you're a starfish, oxytocin makes your stomach go inside out."
00:06:34,00:06:39,"So it's in starfish world, it's known as the stomach inside out hormone, not the love"
00:06:39,00:06:40,hormone.
00:06:40,00:06:44,"And they go to special lessons, don't they, about how to eat their first meal and it's"
00:06:44,00:06:48,"well, lighter scented candle, difficult underwater, but you can do it."
00:06:48,00:06:52,"So it's good for, as in it's not in a bad way, as in it's not bad for them."
00:06:52,00:06:53,"Yeah, it's good."
00:06:53,00:06:57,It's the chemical which they release when they're hungry so that it kind of sets into
00:06:57,00:07:00,motion this thing that Dan described.
00:07:00,00:07:01,And so we kind of use it for something different?
00:07:01,00:07:04,"Yeah, we use it to feel love."
00:07:04,00:07:07,"Yeah, to make changes in the body to help you to procreate."
00:07:07,00:07:08,Yeah.
00:07:08,00:07:12,"Okay, I'm seeing the difference in romantic stuff that you two say to your partners."
00:07:12,00:07:15,"Andy says, ""I love you."""
00:07:15,00:07:19,"And James says, ""I'm having changes in my body that are helping me to procreate towards"
00:07:19,00:07:21,"you right now."""
00:07:21,00:07:24,Can we say what some starfish do in exactly this?
00:07:24,00:07:26,Now we're kind of on their love life.
00:07:26,00:07:28,Have you heard of pseudo-copulation?
00:07:28,00:07:29,Pseudo-copulation.
00:07:29,00:07:30,Have I?
00:07:30,00:07:33,That's all the copulation that I've ever done.
00:07:33,00:07:37,"I'm so glad we've reached, like, 70s comedian."
00:07:37,00:07:43,"It actually is quite like that because normally, or loads of species of starfish operacy, there"
00:07:43,00:07:48,"are dozens and dozens, normally they release sperm and eggs near each other and they then"
00:07:48,00:07:53,"meet up and you know, there's no sex as we understand it at all, but pseudo-copulation"
00:07:53,00:07:54,is kind of similar.
00:07:54,00:07:59,"So a male and a female, they form a pair and the male, quite sweetness, puts all his"
00:07:59,00:08:04,arms between the female's arms so they're kind of cuddled and then she releases eggs
00:08:04,00:08:08,right there and he simultaneously releases all his sperm.
00:08:08,00:08:10,"So it's like a very intense cuddle, basically."
00:08:10,00:08:11,"Oh, okay."
00:08:11,00:08:12,That's nice.
00:08:12,00:08:16,"Did you say that's how a particular species does it, sorry?"
00:08:16,00:08:18,"It's how some species do it, yeah, not all of them."
00:08:18,00:08:21,"Do you guys happen to know, I'm only thinking of this because Andy's brought this up, but"
00:08:21,00:08:27,"if you chop a starfish in half and it regenerates into a new starfish, does it carry the same"
00:08:27,00:08:30,age or does it start fresh?
00:08:30,00:08:32,"Because you know, they can live up to like 35 years roughly."
00:08:32,00:08:36,"I think they can start fresh because for some of them, that's actually how they procreate"
00:08:36,00:08:40,"is just by dividing, even more sexless."
00:08:40,00:08:41,That's what I mean.
00:08:41,00:08:45,"They don't need copulation really, they just lob an arm off and they're good."
00:08:45,00:08:50,"Well, they don't necessarily need it, but it's good for genetic diversity copulation."
00:08:50,00:08:55,"That's why I always say to my wife, so this will be good for the genetic diversity of our"
00:08:55,00:09:00,species darling.
00:09:00,00:09:03,"Oh, Valentine's Day for Mark and Elsa."
00:09:03,00:09:05,There are some very cool versions.
00:09:05,00:09:10,I think I really like the cushion starfish because it's not actually star shaped.
00:09:10,00:09:15,"If you look at it, it's like it forgot to sprout its lips/legs, it's just a pentagon"
00:09:15,00:09:16,really.
00:09:16,00:09:20,"And when it's young, it starts out as a pentagon and it just gets bigger and bigger and then"
00:09:20,00:09:22,"it ends up as a big blob, like a cushion."
00:09:22,00:09:23,That's nice.
00:09:23,00:09:24,And it's quite nice.
00:09:24,00:09:29,"There are about 2,000 of them, 2,000 species and we're in dangerous times."
00:09:29,00:09:35,"So back in episode 45, James mentioned a thing which was the starfish wasting syndrome,"
00:09:35,00:09:39,which is this really horrible disease that has just been sweeping through the oceans and
00:09:39,00:09:44,"within hours of a starfish getting this disease, they are dying and they're dying in really"
00:09:44,00:09:45,weird ways.
00:09:45,00:09:49,"So as James mentioned, one of the arms sort of dislodges itself and just walks off into"
00:09:49,00:09:50,the distance.
00:09:50,00:09:55,"So they keep finding these arms everywhere, just laying on the seabed and then a completely"
00:09:55,00:10:00,"gooey, yucky starfish that's just been eaten by this disease."
00:10:00,00:10:03,And we are losing billions at a time at the moment.
00:10:03,00:10:05,"It's so huge, it's so bad."
00:10:05,00:10:09,"And as far as I can tell, the leading scientists who are trying to work out what's going on"
00:10:09,00:10:11,are studying it in a tank.
00:10:11,00:10:15,And do you know where this tank is?
00:10:15,00:10:19,"It's in Star City, no, it's in the Madame Tussauds."
00:10:19,00:10:22,It's in the Pentagon and it's got Pentagon starfish in it.
00:10:22,00:10:23,Very nice.
00:10:23,00:10:26,That's lovely.
00:10:26,00:10:27,How are we supposed to know that?
00:10:27,00:10:30,It's in one of those restaurants where you go and they've got all those lobsters sort
00:10:30,00:10:33,of sad looking and lobsters hanging around and it's in there.
00:10:33,00:10:34,It's not that.
00:10:34,00:10:35,I'll give you a clue.
00:10:35,00:10:37,It's in the Mexican Aquarium where Free Willy was based.
00:10:37,00:10:38,"Oh, that's great."
00:10:38,00:10:39,You were basically there.
00:10:39,00:10:45,"It is literally in a warehouse right behind the place where Keiko was held, where Free"
00:10:45,00:10:46,Willy was held.
00:10:46,00:10:47,Holy shit.
00:10:47,00:10:48,"Oh my god, that was such a good guess."
00:10:48,00:10:49,Yeah.
00:10:49,00:10:50,That's great.
00:10:50,00:10:54,"Yeah, so they're studying them there and they've found a method which is kind of helping"
00:10:54,00:10:56,them but you can't get that into the oceans right now.
00:10:56,00:10:57,It's insane.
00:10:57,00:10:58,There's nothing we can do.
00:10:58,00:10:59,But what's causing it?
00:10:59,00:11:00,Is it?
00:11:00,00:11:01,They think it's a bacteria.
00:11:01,00:11:02,Is it?
00:11:02,00:11:03,Yeah.
00:11:03,00:11:05,But they don't actually know and James mentioned this close to 10 years ago and we're still
00:11:05,00:11:06,none the wiser.
00:11:06,00:11:07,It's ridiculous.
00:11:07,00:11:11,What's the point of me bringing these subjects to light if they're not going to do anything
00:11:11,00:11:12,in nine years?
00:11:12,00:11:17,"Honestly, you guys, listen back to episode 45, 46, 47."
00:11:17,00:11:18,Yeah.
00:11:18,00:11:22,"I was always bringing up these really important things and everyone just ignored me, like"
00:11:22,00:11:23,Cassandra.
00:11:23,00:11:24,Yeah.
00:11:24,00:11:25,"It's hard to know what to do about it, isn't it?"
00:11:25,00:11:29,"As you're everyday man on the street, maybe we need a free starfish, you know, Free Willy"
00:11:29,00:11:30,sequel.
00:11:30,00:11:36,"Oh yeah, flinging it into the ocean, I don't know."
00:11:36,00:11:41,"Since 2013, five billion have died from this disease and they're down population wise by"
00:11:41,00:11:42,90%.
00:11:42,00:11:43,It's mad.
00:11:43,00:11:44,Oh my goodness.
00:11:44,00:11:45,That's terrible.
00:11:45,00:11:47,You can also eat starfish.
00:11:47,00:11:48,Can you?
00:11:48,00:11:49,Yes.
00:11:49,00:11:52,Some places in the Far East do.
00:11:52,00:11:56,There's a place called Qingdao where it's quite common that they eat starfish.
00:11:56,00:12:00,I've seen a blog of people making them and eating them.
00:12:00,00:12:04,What you do is you kind of break off the leg and then you open it up and then the meat
00:12:04,00:12:05,is inside.
00:12:05,00:12:12,"And it looks like, if you can imagine a baby's nappy when they've first gone on to solids,"
00:12:12,00:12:13,it looks a bit like that.
00:12:13,00:12:18,"Why did you get fired as the restaurant menu description writer for this place, James?"
00:12:18,00:12:19,I don't know.
00:12:19,00:12:25,I thought it was a visual way of describing it and apparently the taste is the same as
00:12:25,00:12:27,a beach smells low tide.
00:12:27,00:12:28,Right.
00:12:28,00:12:29,Wow.
00:12:29,00:12:34,"They eat them in Qingdao, but to be honest, these days it's mostly a thing for tourists"
00:12:34,00:12:35,who got to Qingdao.
00:12:35,00:12:37,The locals don't really eat anymore.
00:12:37,00:12:41,If you ordered it for dinner and you ate sort of like three quarters of it and asked for it
00:12:41,00:12:47,"in a doggy bag, by the time you got home, would you have a full meal again?"
00:12:47,00:12:49,They leave footprints wherever they go.
00:12:49,00:12:51,So very bad criminals.
00:12:51,00:12:52,Lip prints.
00:12:52,00:12:53,Lip prints.
00:12:53,00:12:54,Sorry.
00:12:54,00:12:55,Yes.
00:12:55,00:13:00,This was actually an interesting study that I read about on a blog called the Echino blog.
00:13:00,00:13:04,"It's this guy called Christopher Ma, who calls himself the starfish guy."
00:13:04,00:13:10,"He's written multiple entries a month on just starfish for 10 years, stopped in 2018."
00:13:10,00:13:15,So literally just hundreds and hundreds of entries just about starfish.
00:13:15,00:13:20,"And he reported that they don't have suction cups on their feet, which is what everyone"
00:13:20,00:13:21,always says.
00:13:21,00:13:22,"Yeah, right."
00:13:22,00:13:23,They stick to things by suction.
00:13:23,00:13:24,Yes.
00:13:24,00:13:26,It's actually more like glue.
00:13:26,00:13:30,"So they have a fuzzy coat, what's called a fuzzy coat on each foot."
00:13:30,00:13:32,They've got hundreds and hundreds of feet on each leg.
00:13:32,00:13:36,"So on each foot they've got a fuzzy coat and when that touches the ground, they push this"
00:13:36,00:13:41,"kind of gluey film through it, which forms a mesh and that sticks them to the ground."
00:13:41,00:13:46,"And then when they lift their leg up again, they leave the fuzzy coat behind."
00:13:46,00:13:51,And you can track a starfish across the sea floor if it's shop lifted because they leave
00:13:51,00:13:56,"these constant, every single one of their little suction things, leaves a little fuzzy"
00:13:56,00:13:57,coat behind.
00:13:57,00:13:59,"And then you have to take a lip print, which is quite sexy."
00:13:59,00:14:04,"You have an underground group who would do you Botox in your lips, like if you'd just"
00:14:04,00:14:06,"a prime, they'd be able to hide."
00:14:06,00:14:07,Like face off.
00:14:07,00:14:08,Yeah.
00:14:08,00:14:09,"It's like face off, but just with lips."
00:14:09,00:14:10,Lips off.
00:14:10,00:14:11,Yeah.
00:14:11,00:14:12,Lips off.
00:14:12,00:14:13,"Oh, and is it Travolta and Nicolas Cage?"
00:14:13,00:14:15,They have to swap lips.
00:14:15,00:14:16,Just the lips.
00:14:16,00:14:17,Just the lips.
00:14:17,00:14:18,Yeah.
00:14:18,00:14:22,I think I would watch that film if it was Mick Jagger and Michael Gove.
00:14:22,00:14:23,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:23,00:14:26,"Like you want two people with very different types of lips, don't you?"
00:14:26,00:14:27,"Oh, yes."
00:14:27,00:14:28,Yeah.
00:14:28,00:14:31,"And I mean, we are getting into the realm of a body swap comedy here, where Gove has"
00:14:31,00:14:33,to live as Jagger and vice versa.
00:14:33,00:14:34,Yeah.
00:14:34,00:14:41,"It's weird, you say vice versa, because the body swap comedy genre, which includes what,"
00:14:41,00:14:46,"like, Free Free Friday, all that stuff, it began in the 19th century with a book called"
00:14:46,00:14:47,vice versa.
00:14:47,00:14:48,Oh.
00:14:48,00:14:49,First ever one.
00:14:49,00:14:50,Superb knowledge.
00:14:50,00:14:53,Father and the son who swap places.
00:14:53,00:14:58,"And the story goes that Anthony Trollop was reading this book out to his friends, and"
00:14:58,00:15:03,"he found a bit, which was so funny that he just got into a laughing fit and he died."
00:15:03,00:15:04,No.
00:15:04,00:15:05,Trollop died of laughing?
00:15:05,00:15:07,"I mean, no, he didn't really."
00:15:07,00:15:08,Let's be clear on that.
00:15:08,00:15:09,He did.
00:15:09,00:15:10,He did.
00:15:10,00:15:11,"Well, he died of a stroke."
00:15:11,00:15:16,"He died of a stroke, which he had due to intense laughter, and he died a few weeks later."
00:15:16,00:15:17,"But I think that is true, actually."
00:15:17,00:15:18,What?
00:15:18,00:15:19,Hold on.
00:15:19,00:15:20,He laughed intensely.
00:15:20,00:15:22,"And then he had a stroke immediately, and then he died a few weeks later."
00:15:22,00:15:23,Sorry.
00:15:23,00:15:26,"It wasn't like he had a stroke a few weeks later, and they went, remember, when he laughed"
00:15:26,00:15:28,"a couple of months ago, but it was that."
00:15:28,00:15:29,That's a better story.
00:15:29,00:15:30,Yeah.
00:15:30,00:15:31,Yeah.
00:15:31,00:15:34,"Basically, Freaky Friday killed Anthony Trollop."
00:15:34,00:15:35,Wow.
00:15:35,00:15:38,"Now, that's a fact."
00:15:38,00:15:44,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:15:44,00:15:49,My fact this week is that one of the best times for Dracula to suck your blood is while
00:15:49,00:15:52,you are watching a Dracula movie.
00:15:52,00:15:53,Oh.
00:15:53,00:15:54,No.
00:15:54,00:15:59,Is that because it's so thrilling normally to watch a Dracula movie that you'll be distracted?
00:15:59,00:16:05,"Or is it because you're watching the Dracula movie, then if you see Dracula in your house,"
00:16:05,00:16:08,"you think, oh, that's normal because it's happening on the TV, so it's happening here"
00:16:08,00:16:10,as normal as well.
00:16:10,00:16:12,"We stumbled into the confusion of the fact immediately, which is, do you mean the best"
00:16:12,00:16:15,time for Dracula or the best time for you?
00:16:15,00:16:19,Because often what's good for a vampire is not good for the person the vampire is sucking
00:16:19,00:16:20,on.
00:16:20,00:16:22,Or is it mutually good for everyone?
00:16:22,00:16:26,"No, it's never good for the person being sucked unless they want to become a vampire,"
00:16:26,00:16:29,which often does happen within that world.
00:16:29,00:16:31,But it's fantastic for Dracula.
00:16:31,00:16:32,The fictional world.
00:16:32,00:16:33,The fictional world.
00:16:33,00:16:39,"It's fantastic for Dracula himself because he loves blood, and your blood is at its thickest,"
00:16:39,00:16:44,"or at least it's much thicker when you're watching a vampire movie, a horror movie, anything"
00:16:44,00:16:45,with scares in it.
00:16:45,00:16:46,So.
00:16:46,00:16:47,"Okay, two things."
00:16:47,00:16:48,Yeah.
00:16:48,00:16:49,Does he like thicker blood?
00:16:49,00:16:50,Exactly.
00:16:50,00:16:53,"Like if your milkshake gets too thick, you can't get it through the straw."
00:16:53,00:16:56,"Oh, great point."
00:16:56,00:17:01,"But if it's too thin, you send back your cup of milk, don't you?"
00:17:01,00:17:02,That's true.
00:17:02,00:17:03,So maybe it's just right.
00:17:03,00:17:05,"And secondly, you said much thicker."
00:17:05,00:17:09,It's presumably not so thick it can't get through your veins and arteries.
00:17:09,00:17:10,It's like tar.
00:17:10,00:17:11,"Yeah, exactly."
00:17:11,00:17:12,Okay.
00:17:12,00:17:13,Yeah.
00:17:13,00:17:14,"No, it's just a bit thicker."
00:17:14,00:17:18,So it's a nice meal for Dracula.
00:17:18,00:17:22,"This is a study that was done at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and basically they wanted"
00:17:22,00:17:28,"to analyze blood samples from volunteers who had watched a horror movie, and then at another"
00:17:28,00:17:34,"point watch a very distinctly very unfrightening movie, a documentary."
00:17:34,00:17:37,And so what they did was they found two different movies to show them.
00:17:37,00:17:42,"They found the 2010 horror movie Insidious, which they showed to them."
00:17:42,00:17:47,"And then a week later, they showed them a very, as they call it, non-alarmic documentary"
00:17:47,00:17:49,called A Year in Champagne.
00:17:49,00:17:53,What they found is that the people who sat through Insidious had high levels of the blood
00:17:53,00:17:55,"clotting protein, which is called Factor 8."
00:17:55,00:18:00,Did you know that this is pretty unrelated to the subject of this fact?
00:18:00,00:18:06,"But Champagne in Russia now can only be called Champagne if it's made not in Champagne, if"
00:18:06,00:18:07,it's made in Russia.
00:18:07,00:18:11,I think so everywhere else we're only allowed to call Champagne Champagne if it's made in
00:18:11,00:18:12,the Champagne region.
00:18:12,00:18:13,It's one of those.
00:18:13,00:18:18,Whereas Russia has changed trademark laws so that it can only be if it's Russian Champagne.
00:18:18,00:18:22,"So if not in America as well, you're allowed to call whatever you want Champagne in America."
00:18:22,00:18:23,Really?
00:18:23,00:18:29,"Yeah, because it was in the decision to call things Champagne, that rule, was in the Treaty"
00:18:29,00:18:30,of Versailles.
00:18:30,00:18:33,And the Americans never ratified the Treaty of Versailles.
00:18:33,00:18:36,They had their own treaty against the Germans.
00:18:36,00:18:37,Sorry.
00:18:37,00:18:43,Why are there being bolt-ons added to the Treaty of Versailles about Champagne nomenclature?
00:18:43,00:18:47,"I mean, shouldn't we be just focusing on, should we just fix on the water and the wars and"
00:18:47,00:18:48,bring that safely to a conclusion?
00:18:48,00:18:53,I kind of feel like we're going quite a long way away from Danzbach to Dracula here.
00:18:53,00:18:54,"Yeah, fine."
00:18:54,00:18:57,"But yeah, basically it was because Germans were making sparkling wine as well."
00:18:57,00:19:02,And also the Champagne region had been quite badly hit by the war.
00:19:02,00:19:03,Vampires?
00:19:03,00:19:04,Yeah.
00:19:04,00:19:05,Can we talk about real vampires for a bit?
00:19:05,00:19:06,"Yeah, go on."
00:19:06,00:19:07,But then proper...
00:19:07,00:19:08,Not real.
00:19:08,00:19:09,The people who live in the world are vampires.
00:19:09,00:19:10,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:10,00:19:11,Sure.
00:19:11,00:19:12,Yeah.
00:19:12,00:19:13,So I was reading about them.
00:19:13,00:19:15,"Basically, most of them don't drink blood."
00:19:15,00:19:21,"There are a few, the Sanguinarians, but even they are really careful, obviously, because"
00:19:21,00:19:24,you can get all sorts of diseases from drinking blood.
00:19:24,00:19:30,But I think the vast majority are apparently psychic energy drainers who go along to places
00:19:30,00:19:35,and feel the energy at places like concerts and then suck the life force from that.
00:19:35,00:19:39,"But we all know people who, when you talk to them, you feel like you're having the life"
00:19:39,00:19:40,force suck from you.
00:19:40,00:19:42,And I just thought those were boring people.
00:19:42,00:19:45,But it turns out they might actually be vampires.
00:19:45,00:19:46,Is that right?
00:19:46,00:19:48,I think they also give massages.
00:19:48,00:19:54,"I think the idea is like, if you give someone a massage, you can suck up their energy from"
00:19:54,00:19:55,that.
00:19:55,00:19:56,So rub it out of them.
00:19:56,00:19:57,Wow.
00:19:57,00:20:00,"Well, also, if someone's going to suck away my psychic energy, then I want to be getting"
00:20:00,00:20:02,"something in return for it, I guess."
00:20:02,00:20:03,So a massage seems like a fair deal.
00:20:03,00:20:04,That is a good deal.
00:20:04,00:20:09,"Let's reverse Reiki instead of putting your good energy into someone, you're taking it"
00:20:09,00:20:10,out.
00:20:10,00:20:11,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:11,00:20:12,Reiki?
00:20:12,00:20:13,OK.
00:20:13,00:20:14,I don't really know Reiki.
00:20:14,00:20:15,"No, not really."
00:20:15,00:20:17,"We've got into some ropey territory here, haven't we?"
00:20:17,00:20:18,Some non-fact-based territory.
00:20:18,00:20:19,"Yeah, yeah."
00:20:19,00:20:20,"It's pseudoscience, but it's quite famous."
00:20:20,00:20:21,"Oh, sorry."
00:20:21,00:20:25,Let's get back to vampires and sucking psychic energy.
00:20:25,00:20:26,Yeah.
00:20:26,00:20:31,"Well, you do get fang smiths as well, people who make prosthetic fangs for other vampires."
00:20:31,00:20:36,"I read an interview with a bloke who's called Father Sebastian, so it's Sebastian, but with"
00:20:36,00:20:39,two As at the end in the final bit.
00:20:39,00:20:44,"It's very touching, actually, that he's a fang smith because his grandfather was an orthodontist."
00:20:44,00:20:45,Oh.
00:20:45,00:20:46,Really?
00:20:46,00:20:49,"And so he stayed in the family business, but he's just catering for a slightly more niche"
00:20:49,00:20:50,audience.
00:20:50,00:20:51,"Only makes canines, basically."
00:20:51,00:20:52,Yeah.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"You can't do incisors, mate."
00:20:54,00:20:55,Sorry.
00:20:55,00:20:59,"Real vampires refer to themselves sometimes as 'hemosexuals', which I find quite funny."
00:20:59,00:21:00,That's nice.
00:21:00,00:21:01,That's quite good.
00:21:01,00:21:02,Apart from...
00:21:02,00:21:03,"It's not implied that you're attracted to blood, sexually."
00:21:03,00:21:06,"Well, and they're very clear that they're not attracted to blood, sexually."
00:21:06,00:21:07,That's a completely different thing.
00:21:07,00:21:10,"Well, why do they call themselves 'hemosexuals'?"
00:21:10,00:21:13,"It's a funny quip, all right?"
00:21:13,00:21:14,It's just a...
00:21:14,00:21:17,"Yeah, I like that they're doing themselves any favours of people thinking they're just"
00:21:17,00:21:18,people.
00:21:18,00:21:19,No.
00:21:19,00:21:23,"So maybe it's a nickname coined from outside the vamp community, I don't know."
00:21:23,00:21:28,They should focus really on the fact that we are in the minority as blood drinkers in
00:21:28,00:21:33,"history, really, because there are just so many instances of people drinking blood, which"
00:21:33,00:21:34,I suppose makes sense.
00:21:34,00:21:41,"It was quite available, but it's always the blood of criminals, it seems to me."
00:21:41,00:21:44,And so there's been this belief for thousands of years that blood drinking cured epilepsy.
00:21:44,00:21:50,"I don't know where that came from, but it's right from ancient Rome, and people would"
00:21:50,00:21:55,"drink the blood of vanquished gladiators, or more commonly, they'd drink the blood of"
00:21:55,00:21:56,beheaded criminals.
00:21:56,00:22:01,"And this ran all the way up to, you know, 1500 years later."
00:22:01,00:22:05,"In fact, in 1860, there was a source that reported epileptics would still stand around"
00:22:05,00:22:10,"the executioner's block in Alaskan islands with cups in hand, waiting for the blood to"
00:22:10,00:22:13,spew out so that they could drink it.
00:22:13,00:22:18,It was always said that medically the blood that was best for curing epilepsy was the
00:22:18,00:22:22,"blood of criminals, which does seem quite convenient that it's also the blood that happens to be"
00:22:22,00:22:24,likely to flow from the executioner's block.
00:22:24,00:22:26,"Yes, that's true."
00:22:26,00:22:30,"I read one article on this subject, which I think made a good point, which is, if you"
00:22:30,00:22:36,"see someone bleeding, God forbid they're bleeding to death, they're getting weaker"
00:22:36,00:22:38,and weaker as they lose the blood.
00:22:38,00:22:43,"And so it does kind of make logical sense that ingesting blood would make you stronger,"
00:22:43,00:22:47,and that's probably why people have done it for most of history.
00:22:47,00:22:48,Right.
00:22:48,00:22:49,Right.
00:22:49,00:22:53,"So if you see someone dying of loss of blood on the ground, should you hand over your arm"
00:22:53,00:22:56,and just let them gnaw on it until help comes?
00:22:56,00:22:57,No.
00:22:57,00:23:01,"They're a very, very, very scary film, and it will clot fast enough that actually they'll"
00:23:01,00:23:02,be fine.
00:23:02,00:23:03,Yeah.
00:23:03,00:23:09,"Or try and maybe put some pressure on the large veins, maybe try and stop the bleeding."
00:23:09,00:23:10,Yeah.
00:23:10,00:23:11,Hopefully there's two of you.
00:23:11,00:23:13,"So one of you can do the boo, and the other one can do the tourniquet."
00:23:13,00:23:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:14,00:23:15,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:15,00:23:18,I'll just re-enact a Dracula film while I'm...
00:23:18,00:23:19,Yes.
00:23:19,00:23:22,"Oh, one last thing, vampire bats."
00:23:22,00:23:26,"So they do, you know how we were talking at the top of this fact about how would Dracula"
00:23:26,00:23:30,"prefer to have thicker blood, would that not be too thick?"
00:23:30,00:23:37,"So vampire bats have a saliva that contains an enzyme which is called draculin, and it"
00:23:37,00:23:42,"basically prevents blood clotting, so that when it releases this thing, it goes into"
00:23:42,00:23:46,"the bloodstream, which means the blood can just all flow much quicker."
00:23:46,00:23:50,So obviously directly named after Bram Stoker's creation.
00:23:50,00:23:52,"How did you pronounce it, then?"
00:23:52,00:23:53,Draculin.
00:23:53,00:23:56,"I think it's pronounced draculin, ah, ah, ah, ah, sorry."
00:23:56,00:23:57,Yes.
00:23:57,00:24:00,"There's a silent ""ha, ha, ha"" in the writing here."
00:24:00,00:24:05,"But yeah, and so what they've worked out is if they can take this enzyme, and there's"
00:24:05,00:24:08,"tests that have been going on, there may be new results, but from when I last read it,"
00:24:08,00:24:14,"it was still in the research stage, it can be applied to help stroke victims by breaking"
00:24:14,00:24:19,"down blood clots, and stroke is an anagram of Stoker."
00:24:19,00:24:22,"Dun, dun, dun, that is..."
00:24:22,00:24:24,"Wow, you really beat that together."
00:24:24,00:24:25,I love it.
00:24:25,00:24:28,I've got shivers down my spine and I can feel my blood thickening as you speak.
00:24:28,00:24:31,It goes all the way to the top.
00:24:31,00:24:40,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:24:40,00:24:47,"Okay, my fact this week is that in 1554, thousands of people in London were convinced that they"
00:24:47,00:24:59,heard an angel talking to them from behind a wall and slagging off the Queen.
00:24:59,00:25:05,"Sorry, is that what an angel would do, though, if it came down to her?"
00:25:05,00:25:12,"Well, if the Queen was Queen Mary, Bloody Mary, who was doing terrible things in the"
00:25:12,00:25:15,"name of religion, then you might do, I don't know."
00:25:15,00:25:17,"No, maybe you would as an angel."
00:25:17,00:25:21,"So yeah, that's spoiler alert, the Queen that I'm referring to, Bloody Mary, who was on"
00:25:21,00:25:28,"the throne at the time, obviously lots of upheaval in Europe about Protestantism and Catholicism"
00:25:28,00:25:29,and stuff like that.
00:25:29,00:25:38,"The Queen was about to marry Philip, the second, I think, of Spain, and there were lots of"
00:25:38,00:25:43,"people in England who weren't very happy about this because he was a big old Catholic, and"
00:25:43,00:25:46,so they tried to do whatever they could to stop it.
00:25:46,00:25:50,"One of the things would be to rouse up the rabble, and one of the ways that they thought"
00:25:50,00:25:55,"to do this was to pretend that there was an angel in a wall, and the angel in question"
00:25:55,00:26:02,"was a woman called Elizabeth Crofts, who, according to the Dictionary of National Biography,"
00:26:02,00:26:08,"nothing is known of her before 1554, and nothing was heard of her after 1554."
00:26:08,00:26:13,"She just comes into history, does this amazing thing, and then disappears again."
00:26:13,00:26:14,It's incredible.
00:26:14,00:26:15,"You've got a lot on, haven't you?"
00:26:15,00:26:16,Yeah.
00:26:16,00:26:21,"I read a blog by a history writer called Susan Abernethy, and she was saying that they believe"
00:26:21,00:26:28,"she might have been born in 1535 because there's details written that she was of a certain age,"
00:26:28,00:26:30,and so they've just pieced it back that way.
00:26:30,00:26:34,"They believe that she was working in a house at the time as a maid, and so she was put behind"
00:26:34,00:26:35,this wall.
00:26:35,00:26:40,"She was given a whistle so that she could make weird whistling noises, and then she also"
00:26:40,00:26:46,"began to speak sort of anti-Catholic propaganda, and people started calling her the angel or"
00:26:46,00:26:48,a bird that was in the wall.
00:26:48,00:26:52,"So it could have been a bird, is the other option, by the way."
00:26:52,00:26:56,Still crazy if a bird is saying stuff about the Queen's forthcoming marriage.
00:26:56,00:27:00,"I would still stop on the street and listen to that, and they hid people in the crowd,"
00:27:00,00:27:03,"unless it was Parrot Andy, who's going, ""Parrot?"
00:27:03,00:27:04,"Parrot?"""
00:27:04,00:27:05,"Yeah, that's interesting."
00:27:05,00:27:09,"I'm sort of now wondering what I would stop on the street for, as in if a parrot was doing"
00:27:09,00:27:12,quite convincing sectarian propaganda.
00:27:12,00:27:14,I would probably pause.
00:27:14,00:27:19,"But even if you're in a rush, you're five minutes late for the podcast already, we're"
00:27:19,00:27:23,"going to have no sympathy if it's, ""Oh, I stopped on the street because there's a parrot giving"
00:27:23,00:27:25,"anti-Catholic propaganda."""
00:27:25,00:27:29,"Yeah, if I was in a rush, I'd probably just sort of hope it would still be there when"
00:27:29,00:27:34,"I came back the other way, which I think she was, wasn't she, Elizabeth Crosses?"
00:27:34,00:27:38,"She had to be stuck in, I think she was in the wall sort of, like she was hidden inside"
00:27:38,00:27:39,the wall.
00:27:39,00:27:43,"Well, it was like a facade wall, yeah, that was put out in front of the main wall, I think,"
00:27:43,00:27:44,and she was sort of in between.
00:27:44,00:27:45,And it lasted days.
00:27:45,00:27:47,"So yeah, did she sleep there?"
00:27:47,00:27:48,Did she go home?
00:27:48,00:27:50,Was there a door in the other wall that she could go through?
00:27:50,00:27:51,There must have been a way of getting her out.
00:27:51,00:27:52,So many questions.
00:27:52,00:27:55,"I think the point though, Anna, is that it's saying it's a bird or an angel."
00:27:55,00:27:59,"That would be the debate, Andy would be going by and he would just have an opinion going,"
00:27:59,00:28:00,"""What's obviously a parrot?"""
00:28:00,00:28:01,"And they're saying, ""No, we think it might be an angel."""
00:28:01,00:28:03,"You know, there's mystery there."
00:28:03,00:28:04,I see.
00:28:04,00:28:05,I see.
00:28:05,00:28:09,"Well, we called up Ra in the end and they went to the mayor of London and the mayor"
00:28:09,00:28:13,"of London said, ""Well, why don't we just knock down the wall and see whether it's a bird"
00:28:13,00:28:14,"or an angel or what?"""
00:28:14,00:28:20,"And they knocked down the wall and sure enough, it was this woman, Elizabeth Crosses."
00:28:20,00:28:24,This just reminds me so much of when I tanned essays in late and I just wouldn't have a plan
00:28:24,00:28:26,"for when the teacher said, ""Where's your essay?"""
00:28:26,00:28:29,"It's like, surely the people who know that there's a girl behind the wall are watching"
00:28:29,00:28:33,"the demolition men knocking brick after brick and saying, ""How are we going to deal with"
00:28:33,00:28:34,"this?"""
00:28:34,00:28:35,Yeah.
00:28:35,00:28:40,"They should have put her in like either an angel or a parrot costume, shouldn't they?"
00:28:40,00:28:41,Yeah.
00:28:41,00:28:42,Yeah.
00:28:42,00:28:43,Exactly.
00:28:43,00:28:44,Or a brick costume.
00:28:44,00:28:45,"Oh, brilliant."
00:28:45,00:28:46,Yes.
00:28:46,00:28:47,"Oh, no."
00:28:47,00:28:48,But that's dangerous.
00:28:48,00:28:50,That's dangerous as someone comes in with a sledgehammer hitting bricks.
00:28:50,00:28:51,You don't want to be dressed as a brick.
00:28:51,00:28:53,"But she can just say, ""I'm a talking brick."
00:28:53,00:28:58,"I'm a magical talking brick who's got strong opinions about the Queen's religious faith."""
00:28:58,00:28:59,Yeah.
00:28:59,00:29:01,"You wouldn't dare destroy that, would you?"
00:29:01,00:29:02,No.
00:29:02,00:29:04,"You could just say sort of quickly the context like why is all that, I mean James you've"
00:29:04,00:29:08,"already said a bit of it, but basically England had been through a right old nightmare in"
00:29:08,00:29:14,"the previous decades where England was Catholic and then Henry VIII, Mary's dad broke with"
00:29:14,00:29:19,the church and dissolved the monasteries and then his son Edward VI took England even further
00:29:19,00:29:25,"away from the Catholic church and then he died aged about 16 and then Mary, his half-sister"
00:29:25,00:29:29,"became Queen and she was very Catholic, you know."
00:29:29,00:29:30,Dragged it back.
00:29:30,00:29:35,I mean poor old Edward who always gets accused of introducing a very Protestant regime and
00:29:35,00:29:36,the guy was nine.
00:29:36,00:29:42,"I mean there were just lots of old men behind him saying, ""Say this now, I would say that."""
00:29:42,00:29:45,"And the wall was very pro Queen Elizabeth, the future Queen Elizabeth."
00:29:45,00:29:46,The wall?
00:29:46,00:29:47,The wall.
00:29:47,00:29:51,"Yeah, the angel referred in the wall because they would cry out things like, ""God save"
00:29:51,00:29:56,"Queen Mary"" and the wall would stay silent and then they'd say, ""God save Lady Elizabeth"""
00:29:56,00:29:58,"and the wall would say, ""So be it."""
00:29:58,00:30:02,So they really wanted her to get into power because she would have kept it Protestant
00:30:02,00:30:05,according to what they believed at the time.
00:30:05,00:30:08,"You know that Pink Floyd song, ""Break in the Wall"" is actually based on this incident"
00:30:08,00:30:09,in 1554.
00:30:09,00:30:10,Yes.
00:30:10,00:30:13,"You know, you're just another ""Break in the Wall"" is addressed to Elizabeth Croft."
00:30:13,00:30:23,"And then what happened was because she was just a maid who don't need no education, she"
00:30:23,00:30:28,"was let go basically, they decided that she must have been, there must have been other"
00:30:28,00:30:32,people behind it and must have been other people who talked her into it and probably
00:30:32,00:30:35,she was just a pawn in their scheme and they let her go.
00:30:35,00:30:39,I think she was in prison for a couple of weeks and then...
00:30:39,00:30:44,"Was she doing it for any money, which is of course another very famous Pink Floyd song?"
00:30:44,00:30:49,I hope she didn't suffer any brain damage as a result of the wall being broken in on.
00:30:49,00:30:50,Is that another one?
00:30:50,00:30:51,It is.
00:30:51,00:30:52,"I think it is, yeah."
00:30:52,00:30:53,"Yeah, anyway."
00:30:53,00:31:01,"I always think it must be so awkward in the Tudor era when, as you say, there was Elizabeth,"
00:31:01,00:31:04,"who was the daughter of Anne Boleyn, obviously, and then there was Protestant, and then there"
00:31:04,00:31:07,"was Mary, who was very Catholic, and then there was Edward, who was Protestant."
00:31:07,00:31:09,But they all hung out together as well.
00:31:09,00:31:15,"I mean, Mary was essentially sent away from the royal household when Henry divorced Catherine"
00:31:15,00:31:19,"of Aragon, but then she was sort of brought back in a bit of a disgrace because she was"
00:31:19,00:31:23,"Catholic, but brought back in, she's hanging out with Elizabeth, but at the same time,"
00:31:23,00:31:26,they both know that they're on opposite sides.
00:31:26,00:31:27,They also...
00:31:27,00:31:33,"Elizabeth also lived with Lady Jane Gray, which I didn't realize, which for internationalists"
00:31:33,00:31:36,is as famous here as the Nine-Day Queen.
00:31:36,00:31:37,And she's...
00:31:37,00:31:39,"She's the Liz Truss of the monarchy, isn't she?"
00:31:39,00:31:40,She's...
00:31:40,00:31:42,"Famous is such a generous way of putting it, Anna."
00:31:42,00:31:44,"I mean, Lady Jane Gray is not..."
00:31:44,00:31:47,We're not all going around talking about Lady Jane Gray today.
00:31:47,00:31:48,She's pretty obscure.
00:31:48,00:31:49,She's a huge celeb.
00:31:49,00:31:53,Lady Jane Gray and the Kardashians are very much forefront of everyone's mind.
00:31:53,00:31:57,"No, okay, maybe she's famous in year 10 history classes."
00:31:57,00:32:01,"So basically, she was the Protestant, who Edward and the people behind Edward wanted"
00:32:01,00:32:02,on the throne.
00:32:02,00:32:03,Right.
00:32:03,00:32:04,And then Mary had her executed.
00:32:04,00:32:05,Yeah.
00:32:05,00:32:06,And then Mary had her executed.
00:32:06,00:32:08,"Which was kind of par for the course, because you've got to have the people who acclaimance"
00:32:08,00:32:09,to the throne...
00:32:09,00:32:10,Yeah.
00:32:10,00:32:11,"You know, blah, blah, blah, blah."
00:32:11,00:32:12,Yeah.
00:32:12,00:32:13,I do...
00:32:13,00:32:15,"Mary, Queen Mary, Bloody Mary, has a really, really bad reputation, and I think a lot of"
00:32:15,00:32:21,"it is a deeply inherited propaganda, as in you're just kind of assumed, ""Oh, just that"
00:32:21,00:32:26,"she was the awkward awful bit before Queen Elizabeth came in and sorted it all out."""
00:32:26,00:32:30,"But her teenage years were really, I just think of how embarrassed you are as a teenager."
00:32:30,00:32:36,"And basically, firstly, your parents break up, okay, then your dad changes the entire"
00:32:36,00:32:39,religious structure of the country so that he can remarry.
00:32:39,00:32:40,That must be tough as well.
00:32:40,00:32:41,And then...
00:32:41,00:32:42,Exactly.
00:32:42,00:32:44,And then he annulls his marriage to your mum.
00:32:44,00:32:50,"So suddenly, your parents were never married, so now she's illegitimate, and you are downgraded"
00:32:50,00:32:51,from a princess to a lady.
00:32:51,00:32:52,So I mean...
00:32:52,00:32:53,"Yeah, but she's always..."
00:32:53,00:32:55,It must have been very embarrassing.
00:32:55,00:32:59,"But whenever she's whinging about that, she's always got little sister Elizabeth there"
00:32:59,00:33:02,"putting her hand up, going, ""Uh, mate, our dad killed my mum."""
00:33:02,00:33:03,Yeah.
00:33:03,00:33:04,Chopped her head off.
00:33:04,00:33:05,"So keep your mouth shut, love."
00:33:05,00:33:10,But I read that she had to then become part of the sort of servant crew for Elizabeth.
00:33:10,00:33:11,So she didn't even just get demoted.
00:33:11,00:33:14,"She was actively then sort of like, ""Here's your breakfast."""
00:33:14,00:33:15,Little sister.
00:33:15,00:33:16,Yeah.
00:33:16,00:33:17,Yeah.
00:33:17,00:33:18,Oh.
00:33:18,00:33:19,Harsh.
00:33:19,00:33:23,"It is funny that she's remembered as Bloody Mary still now, even though that is anti-catholic"
00:33:23,00:33:24,"propaganda, really."
00:33:24,00:33:28,Or it's the fact that Protestantism or the Church of England won over.
00:33:28,00:33:35,"And also there was that very famous book, Fox's Book of Martyrs, that was..."
00:33:35,00:33:38,"I mean, it's hard to underestimate how popular this book was."
00:33:38,00:33:42,"It was published in 1563, so shortly after Mary had died."
00:33:42,00:33:46,And it was basically the book of all the great Christian martyrs who had died for their faith
00:33:46,00:33:47,throughout time.
00:33:47,00:33:48,And it ended with all of Mary's martyrs.
00:33:48,00:33:54,"So she killed about 260 people, I think, burned at the stake."
00:33:54,00:33:57,And so this was a great piece of propaganda against Mary.
00:33:57,00:34:00,But it sold like 150 million copies.
00:34:00,00:34:01,No.
00:34:01,00:34:02,Hang on.
00:34:02,00:34:03,Hang on.
00:34:03,00:34:04,That's greater than the world's population.
00:34:04,00:34:07,It was over many hundreds of years.
00:34:07,00:34:11,"So for about 300 years, it was the best-selling book alongside the Bible."
00:34:11,00:34:13,And it was so gory.
00:34:13,00:34:15,"I mean, there's got to be a reason it was so popular."
00:34:15,00:34:20,And I think it was the amazing detail of how these people died.
00:34:20,00:34:23,"Like Anne Askew, do you know Anne Askew?"
00:34:23,00:34:27,"Well, she called Anne Askew before she died, or did the Askew bit come after whatever happened"
00:34:27,00:34:29,to her?
00:34:29,00:34:34,She was the first English woman ever to demand a divorce because she was Protestant.
00:34:34,00:34:35,Her husband was Catholic.
00:34:35,00:34:37,She didn't like that.
00:34:37,00:34:42,"And she refused to accept transubstantiation, so refused to believe that the bread was the"
00:34:42,00:34:44,body of Christ.
00:34:44,00:34:48,"And we should say of all these people, I think if they'd recounted, they wouldn't have been"
00:34:48,00:34:49,burned.
00:34:49,00:34:50,"Oh, yeah."
00:34:50,00:34:51,It's their fault.
00:34:51,00:34:52,"Oh, take this."
00:34:52,00:34:53,Take the side of Bloody Mary.
00:34:53,00:34:54,Go on.
00:34:54,00:34:55,"Die, don't you?"
00:34:55,00:34:56,Show a bit of balance.
00:34:56,00:35:00,"She was put on the rack and stretched, which is always nice when you hear about one of"
00:35:00,00:35:05,these really sort of torture instruments you learn about at primary school being used.
00:35:05,00:35:08,"And she was stretched, and all of her limbs were dislocated."
00:35:08,00:35:10,"So that will make you Askew, I mean."
00:35:10,00:35:14,"She was right Askew, yeah, fitting."
00:35:14,00:35:19,"And then she was executed, and she had to be carried to the stake on a chair because she"
00:35:19,00:35:23,"couldn't walk understandably, I imagine sort of flopping over this chair."
00:35:23,00:35:24,Lovely.
00:35:24,00:35:26,"Yeah, so it's that kind of stuff you can see why it's a bestseller."
00:35:26,00:35:31,"Yeah, I think another, I mean, obviously the 200 years of propaganda in England defining"
00:35:31,00:35:35,"itself specifically as being a non-Catholic country will have played into it, but I think"
00:35:35,00:35:39,"another thing was that the burning at the stake, Elizabeth had loads of people executed."
00:35:39,00:35:44,"She had loads of religious heretics executed as well, but she tended to execute them as"
00:35:44,00:35:46,traitors instead of heretics.
00:35:46,00:35:51,"So it was seen as more of a political thing, or it's easier to write off as a political"
00:35:51,00:35:55,"decision rather than Bloody Mary, the religious, you know, religious."
00:35:55,00:36:02,"I mean, Henry VIII, like what, 60,000 probably, compared to a few hundred for Bloody Mary."
00:36:02,00:36:04,"But yeah, they're just like, ""Oh, well, they weren't birds at the stake."
00:36:04,00:36:05,"It wasn't heresy."""
00:36:05,00:36:06,So...
00:36:06,00:36:07,"Yeah, yeah."
00:36:07,00:36:13,"I was trying to think if, because I knew nothing about Mary and the Bloody Mary name."
00:36:13,00:36:14,Is that where we get the name for the drink?
00:36:14,00:36:16,I sort of had a quick look into that.
00:36:16,00:36:18,"Well, no, there's no idea."
00:36:18,00:36:20,Lots of theories about what it could be.
00:36:20,00:36:22,Bloody Mary is obviously one of them.
00:36:22,00:36:23,She's included in there.
00:36:23,00:36:26,There's a thought that it might be the Hollywood star Mary Pickford.
00:36:26,00:36:31,"But one of the main ones is that, and this is quite a famous bar called Harry's New York"
00:36:31,00:36:35,"bar, which I, you know, weirdly is in Paris."
00:36:35,00:36:37,But according to the manager...
00:36:37,00:36:41,I'd run by a guy called Jeff.
00:36:41,00:36:45,"According to the manager, there used to be a cocktail waitress called Mary, who used"
00:36:45,00:36:52,"to work in a Chicago bar called the Bucket of Blood, and supposedly it was that."
00:36:52,00:36:53,Yeah.
00:36:53,00:36:54,That's cool.
00:36:54,00:36:55,We don't know.
00:36:55,00:36:58,"Yeah, probably after that rather than the really famous historical figure who was just"
00:36:58,00:36:59,called Bloody Mary.
00:36:59,00:37:03,"It is amazing all those cocktails because they're all within memory of people, you know, they're"
00:37:03,00:37:09,"all within a couple of generations, but almost every cocktail, the name is lost to the mists"
00:37:09,00:37:10,"of time, isn't it?"
00:37:10,00:37:12,"It's because everyone's pissed, aren't they?"
00:37:12,00:37:15,"As soon as they've invented it, no one can remember how it happened."
00:37:15,00:37:23,"I was looking up the sort of propaganda at the time, and it was the big age of the pamphlet."
00:37:23,00:37:28,"I kind of hope it comes back one day, the pamphlet, because it's a right old ass writing"
00:37:28,00:37:29,a book.
00:37:29,00:37:31,"Have you tried recently, James?"
00:37:31,00:37:33,"Oh, yeah, I have actually."
00:37:33,00:37:38,"Anna and I, in fact, wrote everything to play for the QI Book of Spots, but, you know, far"
00:37:38,00:37:39,beyond from me.
00:37:39,00:37:43,"I just wrote a pamphlet version, which I think you incorporate into your larger book."
00:37:43,00:37:46,"But yeah, it's basically there was such good propaganda, pamphlets."
00:37:46,00:37:47,I don't mean your book.
00:37:47,00:37:52,I'm sure your book is scrupulously even-handed.
00:37:52,00:37:53,You can print them in a couple of days.
00:37:53,00:37:55,You can distribute them fast and cheap.
00:37:55,00:37:58,It was like people having sub-stacks today.
00:37:58,00:38:00,I found out this is slightly later.
00:38:00,00:38:05,"This is a later anti-Catholic document from 1624 called The Travels of Time, right?"
00:38:05,00:38:10,"And it was printed, again, as a sort of regal monarchy commentary."
00:38:10,00:38:16,"So Charles I, who was seen as being quite pro-Catholic, was going to marry the Spanish"
00:38:16,00:38:19,"Infanta, which was a princess, not an infant."
00:38:19,00:38:23,"I mean, given the time, she might also have been eight, but I don't know."
00:38:23,00:38:30,"But the marriage collapsed and people printed, I find this so, again, it's quite gossipy,"
00:38:30,00:38:33,"but they just printed these pamphlets to celebrate the collapse of the marriage, the prospective"
00:38:33,00:38:35,marriage between the two of them.
00:38:35,00:38:37,"And again, if people were doing that about me, I'd be hurt."
00:38:37,00:38:39,But there were all these allegorical images.
00:38:39,00:38:40,That was a huge thing.
00:38:40,00:38:42,And people got all the allegories in these pamphlets.
00:38:42,00:38:47,"So one of the images in this pamphlet showed the Spanish ambassador to England, Don Diego"
00:38:47,00:38:53,"Samiento de Akuma Gondemar, using his buttocks to incubate locust eggs."
00:38:53,00:38:58,And that was an acceptable political point to make at the time.
00:38:58,00:38:59,That is quite good though.
00:38:59,00:39:02,"What's the political, hold on, what do the locust eggs represent?"
00:39:02,00:39:05,Is that the spawn of the devil?
00:39:05,00:39:08,"I think they might represent papacy, popism, you know, that kind of stuff."
00:39:08,00:39:09,And it was incredibly rude.
00:39:09,00:39:14,"This is quite an obscure historical paper, I found this then, because he was, and I'm"
00:39:14,00:39:17,"quoting here, the renowned sufferer of an anal fistula."
00:39:17,00:39:22,So it was especially funny to show him with locust eggs in his bum.
00:39:22,00:39:23,Ouch.
00:39:23,00:39:24,I know.
00:39:24,00:39:25,That's a tough one.
00:39:25,00:39:29,"What a terrible part of your bio that gets used for, like, chat shows."
00:39:29,00:39:33,Famous sufferer of anal fistula.
00:39:33,00:39:39,"He prefers to talk about Anglo-Spanish diplomacy, but of course, we know he's Mr. Fistula."
00:39:39,00:39:41,Welcome to the stage.
00:39:41,00:39:47,"Mr. Fistula does sound like quite a good music hall name for someone, does it?"
00:39:47,00:39:48,Yeah.
00:39:48,00:39:55,"Until 1910, when you became king or queen, you had to swear that you repudiated Catholicism"
00:39:55,00:39:58,as superstitious and idolatrous.
00:39:58,00:40:00,Isn't that amazing?
00:40:00,00:40:02,"Until the 20th century, you had to do that."
00:40:02,00:40:08,"And then Edward VII said, Edward VII did do it, but he insisted on whispering the words,"
00:40:08,00:40:12,because he thought it would be an insult to any Catholics who were living in the country
00:40:12,00:40:13,at the time.
00:40:13,00:40:14,It does sound like it was.
00:40:14,00:40:15,Yeah.
00:40:15,00:40:19,"Who were famously hard of hearing, weren't they?"
00:40:19,00:40:28,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna."
00:40:28,00:40:34,"My fact this week is that this year, a woman was injured when she was attacked twice."
00:40:34,00:40:39,"Once by a five-foot-long snake that fell from the sky, then immediately afterwards by the"
00:40:39,00:40:41,hawk that dropped it.
00:40:41,00:40:46,"This was really some idol maternity leave reading, actually."
00:40:46,00:40:47,I think I read it in the week.
00:40:47,00:40:49,It's just the most incredible story.
00:40:49,00:40:55,"It's a woman called Peggy Jones in Texas who was mowing her lawn, and a large snake fell"
00:40:55,00:40:56,out of the sky.
00:40:56,00:41:02,"Her husband estimated later that it was 4.5 feet long, which is large, and it wrapped"
00:41:02,00:41:03,itself around her arm.
00:41:03,00:41:07,"I'm kind of imagining, you know those things that you used to slap your arm with as a kid,"
00:41:07,00:41:09,and they wrapped around them.
00:41:09,00:41:10,"They'd wrap around, yeah."
00:41:10,00:41:13,"Yeah, I'm sort of imagining it did that as it fell, and she tried to shake it off, and"
00:41:13,00:41:18,"it got tighter and tighter, and the hawk that had been carrying the snake in its mouth plunged"
00:41:18,00:41:22,"down and started attacking it to try and get the snake back, and they both managed to"
00:41:22,00:41:27,"inflict multiple injuries, so the hawk was flying at her and grabbing for the snake and"
00:41:27,00:41:32,slapping her with its wings and clawed these deep cuts in her arm.
00:41:32,00:41:37,"The snake, meanwhile, was striking her in the face and chipping her glasses, and apparently"
00:41:37,00:41:39,spewing a liquid.
00:41:39,00:41:44,"And I love her husband, Wendell, got to her by riding over on his mower."
00:41:44,00:41:45,"Yeah, I'm imagining."
00:41:45,00:41:46,Oh wow.
00:41:46,00:41:47,"Hurry up, Wendell!"
00:41:47,00:41:48,Go into fifth gear!
00:41:48,00:41:51,What a scene.
00:41:51,00:41:58,So she's one of the first people to have been involved in a snake and bird incident since
00:41:58,00:42:05,"just two years ago when Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was, I mean it was a minor celebrity"
00:42:05,00:42:09,"story, he was temporarily barricaded in his home because there was a snake right outside"
00:42:09,00:42:13,"his front door, which was busy being eaten by a large hawk, which was busy eating the"
00:42:13,00:42:14,snake.
00:42:14,00:42:18,"And whenever he kind of got near it, it was threatening and flapping at him."
00:42:18,00:42:19,Wow.
00:42:19,00:42:21,Miner celebrity.
00:42:21,00:42:23,Probably one of the highest paid actors on earth.
00:42:23,00:42:27,"Sorry, I don't mean to call him a minor, I mean the story is a minor story about a major"
00:42:27,00:42:31,"celebrity, but I think we can all agree it's not one of the main things in his life, this"
00:42:31,00:42:32,story.
00:42:32,00:42:34,What a rowback.
00:42:34,00:42:40,"I just don't want to smell what he's cooking, and I'm very happy to say he's a big deal,"
00:42:40,00:42:41,you know?
00:42:41,00:42:43,"He's in ""Jumanji"" for heaven's sake, the new one, not the original."
00:42:43,00:42:48,"The new one, by the way, which has a body swap part in it, which reminds me of an old"
00:42:48,00:42:53,"book called ""Ice Person""."
00:42:53,00:42:58,"Several attacks, they happen way more than I realized, as in if you just do a new search,"
00:42:58,00:43:02,there are multiple stories globally that are just pumped out every single day.
00:43:02,00:43:08,"So just 24 hours ago, when I was, you know, looking at these facts, an Australian farmer,"
00:43:08,00:43:13,"he described himself to the BBC and other outlets as ""lucky to be alive"" after repelling"
00:43:13,00:43:17,a crocodile by biting the crocodile back.
00:43:17,00:43:23,"So he found his face leaning against the crocodile's head, and he bit the eyelid of the crocodile,"
00:43:23,00:43:28,"making the crocodile freak out, it let go of its bite, and he was able to escape, but"
00:43:28,00:43:33,it was only by biting the crocodile back that he was able to get out there.
00:43:33,00:43:34,So many news articles.
00:43:34,00:43:38,"Look, this is literally the last three days, ""Arizona Woman"", fatally trampled by elk,"
00:43:38,00:43:43,"she might have been trying to feed, ""Pornstar's Pet Python"", ""Bite's Partner's Penis"" and"
00:43:43,00:43:45,"""Horocene"", ""Blood Everywhere""."
00:43:45,00:43:51,"Yeah, I mean, the animal world is famously dangerous, Dan, but on things that you don't"
00:43:51,00:43:54,"expect to attack you, I think of otters."
00:43:54,00:43:57,"Well, otters, I think, are the cutest animals alive."
00:43:57,00:44:03,And so I was very surprised about an otter attack on someone called Lea Hillier.
00:44:03,00:44:08,"This was a few years ago, and it's really incredible that it was in Minnesota on this"
00:44:08,00:44:13,"remote lake, and she always went for a swim in the lake, she was staying at her dad's"
00:44:13,00:44:17,"lake house with her kids, always went for a swim in the lake, she swam a mile a day,"
00:44:17,00:44:22,"felt one day something bite her leg, and then about 20 feet away, really quickly, an otter"
00:44:22,00:44:27,"bobbed its head up, and then it kept swimming back to her leg and biting her leg again,"
00:44:27,00:44:30,and then swimming away and then bobbing its head up and looking at her.
00:44:30,00:44:36,"And it bit her 25 times, and like properly, it pierced her ankle bone, it pierced through"
00:44:36,00:44:43,"her calf muscle, just an otter, and she was screaming for help, and her dad, her poor dad"
00:44:43,00:44:48,"had heard these screams and tried to start the motorboat to get to her, and in his panic,"
00:44:48,00:44:52,"he flooded the engine of the motorboat, and he also had to get the kids, she had two kids"
00:44:52,00:44:56,"who were two and four, so he had to get the kids on the boat, so he got another boat started,"
00:44:56,00:45:03,"got out to her, dragged these poor kids' blood drenched mother out of the water, and the"
00:45:03,00:45:07,"maddest thing for me is she got out of the water, got to hospital, was given a rabies"
00:45:07,00:45:12,"shot in every single one of the 25 bites, which made her vomit."
00:45:12,00:45:15,"Two weeks later, she got back in the lake."
00:45:15,00:45:20,"The otter's still in it, the otter's just there, bobbing away, which I feel like I wouldn't"
00:45:20,00:45:21,go swimming again.
00:45:21,00:45:22,That's bullseye.
00:45:22,00:45:28,"You see a few otter stories of them attacking people, there was a minor celebrity story,"
00:45:28,00:45:33,"and I actually will say this is about a minor celebrity, an actor called Crystal Finn, who"
00:45:33,00:45:37,"was in succession, but one of the quite minor characters in succession, I'm sure she's an"
00:45:37,00:45:42,"amazing actor, but I'd never heard of her before, she got beaten on her backside and"
00:45:42,00:45:47,"on her leg this year by otters, there was a guy called Graham George Spencer, who was"
00:45:47,00:45:53,"bitten 26 times in 10 seconds by otters, isn't that amazing?"
00:45:53,00:45:54,Was that multiple otters?
00:45:54,00:45:56,"It was a pack of otters, yeah."
00:45:56,00:46:00,"I don't know what the record is for the world's fastest draw, but that would be up there."
00:46:00,00:46:07,"His friend ran over screaming to try and scare off the otters, and they swam away, but then"
00:46:07,00:46:11,"the pair said they ran towards the visitor centre to get help, still pursued by the"
00:46:11,00:46:12,otters.
00:46:12,00:46:13,Oh no.
00:46:13,00:46:17,Exit pursued by an otter.
00:46:17,00:46:21,"I was reading an article about why animals don't attack us more than they already do,"
00:46:21,00:46:25,"and obviously, most of the time, when animals attack humans, it's because we're in their"
00:46:25,00:46:30,"space, or because they're protecting their young nearby, or because we're on their territory."
00:46:30,00:46:35,"Because we're bipedal, we look bigger, we don't look bigger than we are, but we look"
00:46:35,00:46:39,bigger than we would if we were on all fours.
00:46:39,00:46:40,That's kind of a little bit of a bluff.
00:46:40,00:46:45,"It makes us look a bit tougher, and also, it does mean we're slower."
00:46:45,00:46:48,You can't outrun a cat.
00:46:48,00:46:53,That's kind of maybe perceived as a bit of a show of strength.
00:46:53,00:46:56,I don't need to be able to outrun a cat because I'm so tough.
00:46:56,00:46:57,"That's risky, isn't it?"
00:46:57,00:46:58,I don't know if that's...
00:46:58,00:47:05,"That way, your MMA career is going so well, indeed, because you're like, ""I'm so good"
00:47:05,00:47:06,at MMA.
00:47:06,00:47:07,I don't even have to work out.
00:47:07,00:47:09,I don't have to get buff.
00:47:09,00:47:11,"I don't have to be strong-looking."""
00:47:11,00:47:12,Yeah.
00:47:12,00:47:15,No one has ever turned up to a fight with me in the MMA ring because they're so terrified
00:47:15,00:47:20,of this quite average-looking bloke who seems to have done no exercise.
00:47:20,00:47:21,Yeah.
00:47:21,00:47:24,"I'm always really skeptical about the older, ""Make yourself look bigger by putting your"
00:47:24,00:47:25,"arms out."""
00:47:25,00:47:29,"I guess it must be true because it does work, but it is like, are bears blind?"
00:47:29,00:47:32,Can they not see that once we put our arms out?
00:47:32,00:47:36,It's just two small spindly things sticking out of us.
00:47:36,00:47:39,"Why do they suddenly go, ""Oh my God, he's absolutely massive?"""
00:47:39,00:47:41,I've never noticed before.
00:47:41,00:47:46,"If you're bipedal, you're bigger looking to something that's looking at you from the"
00:47:46,00:47:53,"side, but worms probably think we're smaller than we are because from a worms-eye view,"
00:47:53,00:47:56,"if we were on our old foes, we'd be much bigger."
00:47:56,00:47:57,Yeah.
00:47:57,00:47:58,"And hawks, actually."
00:47:58,00:47:59,Maybe this one was attacked by a hawk because...
00:47:59,00:48:00,That's true.
00:48:00,00:48:03,"They're gone for hawks, actually, rather than worms."
00:48:03,00:48:04,"No, I like worms."
00:48:04,00:48:05,I think that's good.
00:48:05,00:48:09,That's why you get so many worm attacks in these days.
00:48:09,00:48:10,They cover them up.
00:48:10,00:48:11,You do.
00:48:11,00:48:12,We just wouldn't know.
00:48:12,00:48:13,Worms are attacking us all the time.
00:48:13,00:48:14,We've just got no idea.
00:48:14,00:48:16,Just headbutting us for a bill.
00:48:16,00:48:21,"The Hitchcock film, The Worms, was a complete commercial and critical flop, wasn't it?"
00:48:21,00:48:23,"You know, Aeschylus."
00:48:23,00:48:28,"So we mentioned before, ancient Greek playwright who was killed when a bird dropped a tortoise"
00:48:28,00:48:29,on his head.
00:48:29,00:48:30,"Oh, yeah."
00:48:30,00:48:35,So what the idea was that the hawks dropped turtles on rocks to open them up so they can
00:48:35,00:48:39,"eat the delicious turtle inside, and they thought his head was a rock because he was"
00:48:39,00:48:40,so bald.
00:48:40,00:48:41,That was the claim.
00:48:41,00:48:42,That is the claim.
00:48:42,00:48:43,Yeah.
00:48:43,00:48:47,So I just sort of looked him up because I don't think we mentioned anything really
00:48:47,00:48:49,"more about him at the time, just he was an ancient Greek playwright."
00:48:49,00:48:52,And so I found out this about him.
00:48:52,00:48:57,There is a theory that he invented people talking to each other on stage.
00:48:57,00:48:58,Oh.
00:48:58,00:49:01,He was a pretty early dramatist.
00:49:01,00:49:03,And this is a claim by Aristotle.
00:49:03,00:49:06,"So you know, pinch of salt and some earlier sources will have been lost, blah, blah, blah."
00:49:06,00:49:11,But Aristotle claims that basically he invented characters who had conflict between each other.
00:49:11,00:49:15,"And before that, characters could only speak to the chorus, and everyone was speaking to"
00:49:15,00:49:17,the chorus and not to each other on stage.
00:49:17,00:49:18,What an innovation.
00:49:18,00:49:19,What a moment.
00:49:19,00:49:21,"Yeah, that must have been huge."
00:49:21,00:49:25,"And if he hadn't come up with that, we would still all have to be talking to the chorus."
00:49:25,00:49:26,Everything would be to the chorus.
00:49:26,00:49:27,Yeah.
00:49:27,00:49:28,Yeah.
00:49:28,00:49:32,"It's hard to have invented the chorus element first, though, because it seems less of it."
00:49:32,00:49:36,"Because in normal life, it's not like when I chat to someone, it's always mediated by"
00:49:36,00:49:39,a group of 12 people singing annoying songs.
00:49:39,00:49:40,I just do it direct.
00:49:40,00:49:41,"It's quite odd, isn't it?"
00:49:41,00:49:44,"No, but then maybe that's what separated it as fantasy from real life."
00:49:44,00:49:47,"Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to tell the difference, maybe."
00:49:47,00:49:49,He's like Ricky Gervais inventing the office.
00:49:49,00:49:52,"Suddenly, sitcom is just..."
00:49:52,00:49:56,"Eucalus, the Ricky Gervais of his time."
00:49:56,00:50:00,Back to snakes that have been attacking people.
00:50:00,00:50:06,I read a story about a guy who's called Valentin Grimaldo from Texas.
00:50:06,00:50:10,A coral snake came up and bit him on his hand.
00:50:10,00:50:11,He grabbed the snake.
00:50:11,00:50:18,He bit its head off and then used the snake as a band around his arm to cut off.
00:50:18,00:50:19,No.
00:50:19,00:50:20,Yeah.
00:50:20,00:50:21,Like what they call the tonic.
00:50:21,00:50:22,Tonic.
00:50:22,00:50:23,Yeah.
00:50:23,00:50:24,Yeah.
00:50:24,00:50:26,He used that around his arm and then they went off to the hospital's emergency room and
00:50:26,00:50:27,he was fine.
00:50:27,00:50:29,He's still got the head as a keepsake.
00:50:29,00:50:30,Wow.
00:50:30,00:50:31,That's really ignominious.
00:50:31,00:50:32,That's wild.
00:50:32,00:50:33,"That's a snake, isn't it?"
00:50:33,00:50:34,How embarrassing.
00:50:34,00:50:35,You know dragons.
00:50:35,00:50:36,Sure.
00:50:36,00:50:37,Yeah.
00:50:37,00:50:38,Not real.
00:50:38,00:50:42,There is a theory and I think it is a true theory that basically dragons are just sexed
00:50:42,00:50:43,up snakes.
00:50:43,00:50:45,"To what extent is it true theories, Ori?"
00:50:45,00:50:46,I think it's true.
00:50:46,00:50:51,"I think when you look at like people writing about dragons, especially in the Middle Ages,"
00:50:51,00:50:58,they start off being these worm-like creatures with no legs that have stripes on their body
00:50:58,00:51:00,and forked tongues.
00:51:00,00:51:05,"And then as the Middle Ages progresses to the Renaissance, they just become more and"
00:51:05,00:51:09,more fantastical that they can fly and breathe fire and stuff like that.
00:51:09,00:51:15,And so what we reckon is because the kind of story started off in the Southern Europe
00:51:15,00:51:21,and Egypt and whatever where there were plenty of snakes and then they came up into Europe
00:51:21,00:51:23,where there weren't so many snakes.
00:51:23,00:51:26,People just started adding stuff because they didn't know what snakes were like really.
00:51:26,00:51:31,"In the Iliad, the original or the earliest version of the Iliad that we have, it says"
00:51:31,00:51:36,"that the dragon could be eaten by eagles, which obviously the modern day dragon, you"
00:51:36,00:51:39,would not be possibly to do that.
00:51:39,00:51:40,No.
00:51:40,00:51:42,"Bizarrely, on an earlier fact, I had to think about the Odyssey, which I didn't say."
00:51:42,00:51:46,Which is that the Odyssey features the first appearance in literature of black pudding.
00:51:46,00:51:47,"Oh, does it?"
00:51:47,00:51:48,It was about people eating blood.
00:51:48,00:51:50,I think that was why I was on that tangent.
00:51:50,00:51:51,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:51:51,00:51:54,It's a sort of goatee blood sausage that they have and it is clearly a black pudding.
00:51:54,00:51:55,"Oh, wow."
00:51:55,00:51:56,And that's in the Odyssey.
00:51:56,00:51:58,"What's the bigger innovation, do you think, Andy, the introduction of black pudding or"
00:51:58,00:52:00,chatting to each other on stage?
00:52:00,00:52:01,Interesting.
00:52:01,00:52:02,Gosh.
00:52:02,00:52:03,"They're both massive, aren't they?"
00:52:03,00:52:07,"They're both huge deals, but in such different spheres of endeavour."
00:52:07,00:52:11,I reckon most people on Earth could say they could live without one.
00:52:11,00:52:13,I could live without black pudding.
00:52:13,00:52:14,"That's the one I think, Anna, is."
00:52:14,00:52:19,"No, no, no, I think some people would say they could live without drama but not black"
00:52:19,00:52:20,pudding.
00:52:20,00:52:22,"You know, I'm sure there are people in the people."
00:52:22,00:52:23,In the North.
00:52:23,00:52:27,"Yeah, say it, Anna, people in the North."
00:52:27,00:52:32,"It was actually, it was going to go as far as Scotland, in fact, in my stereotyping."
00:52:32,00:52:36,Do we still get Coronation Street and black pudding?
00:52:36,00:52:37,Can we say that at least?
00:52:37,00:52:41,"You can get Coronation Street, but everything is mediated through the character of Emma"
00:52:41,00:52:43,"Elsie Tanner, who plays the chorus."
00:52:43,00:52:44,Yeah.
00:52:44,00:52:49,"Speaking of snakes, have you guys ever seen, and I address this mainly to Dan, a documentary"
00:52:49,00:52:53,on the Discovery Channel in 2014 called Eaton Alive?
00:52:53,00:52:59,Is this where the guy decided to be eaten by a snake and ingested?
00:52:59,00:53:00,I knew you know about him.
00:53:00,00:53:01,Yeah.
00:53:01,00:53:02,"Well, because he went in the wrong way, I think, is the story."
00:53:02,00:53:03,He went in head first.
00:53:03,00:53:04,He went in first.
00:53:04,00:53:05,"Oh, sorry."
00:53:05,00:53:09,He didn't crawl up the snake's arse.
00:53:09,00:53:10,Sorry.
00:53:10,00:53:13,"I've gone in the wrong way, guys."
00:53:13,00:53:24,"It's such a mad, stupid thing to do, and Paul Rosalie was his name, and he, first of all,"
00:53:24,00:53:29,"he was on an expedition in the Amazon to find the biggest anaconda there was, a biggest"
00:53:29,00:53:30,green anaconda there was.
00:53:30,00:53:31,"Yeah, cool."
00:53:31,00:53:32,He'd heard tell that existed.
00:53:32,00:53:33,It would be over 24 feet long.
00:53:33,00:53:34,It would be the world's longest.
00:53:34,00:53:37,"And once he got there, he was going to let it eat him."
00:53:37,00:53:38,And this--
00:53:38,00:53:41,"Was there a day that he was in a sleeping bag or something, or that he was in some kind"
00:53:41,00:53:43,"of sack, which he could then wriggle out of?"
00:53:43,00:53:47,"He wore a special suit so he could survive it, and then he was going to be extracted"
00:53:47,00:53:48,from the snake.
00:53:48,00:53:49,"So he wouldn't be digested, yeah."
00:53:49,00:53:50,And--
00:53:50,00:53:51,Did he go into the--
00:53:51,00:53:52,He totally screwed up.
00:53:52,00:53:56,"So first of all, he didn't find the big anaconda, so he had to be supplied with a 20-foot one"
00:53:56,00:53:58,from a zoo.
00:53:58,00:54:03,"Then he had this suit, which they drenched in pig's blood, to make the snake want to"
00:54:03,00:54:04,eat him.
00:54:04,00:54:05,"Yeah, yeah."
00:54:05,00:54:08,"And then he said, he saw the snake's mouth open, everything went black, I think his head"
00:54:08,00:54:12,"went into the snake, his shoulders maybe went into the snake."
00:54:12,00:54:16,What about his knees and toes?
00:54:16,00:54:19,"And then he was a starfish, so it became very confusing."
00:54:19,00:54:23,That is going to be a real-- when I listen back to that edit and see which of us got
00:54:23,00:54:26,"it burst with that one, it was a real--"
00:54:26,00:54:27,Photo finish.
00:54:27,00:54:28,Yeah.
00:54:28,00:54:32,"So wait, sorry, his head went into the snake and everything went black."
00:54:32,00:54:33,How mysterious.
00:54:33,00:54:34,Yeah.
00:54:34,00:54:35,"So then, yeah, then what?"
00:54:35,00:54:36,"I mean, I think he--"
00:54:36,00:54:37,"Well, then, yeah."
00:54:37,00:54:38,He tapped out.
00:54:38,00:54:43,"The snake started twisting his body and started wrenching his arm around a bit, and he suddenly"
00:54:43,00:54:48,"thought, oh, this hurts, my arm's hurting, and started shouting to the technical assistants,"
00:54:48,00:54:50,"can you get me out now, please?"
00:54:50,00:54:54,"He wasn't on his own, so he was shouting from inside the snake, get me out, I'm done."
00:54:54,00:54:56,And so they managed to extract him from the snake.
00:54:56,00:54:57,Wow.
00:54:57,00:54:58,Yeah.
00:54:58,00:55:01,"Did he shout, I'm a minor celebrity, get me out of here?"
00:55:01,00:55:04,He's not the rock.
00:55:04,00:55:08,"He said it was all to raise awareness about the plight of wildlife in the Amazon, about"
00:55:08,00:55:11,which there's some skepticism from me.
00:55:11,00:55:15,"Well, he just has, because now we've got some message."
00:55:15,00:55:19,"No one's coming away from this podcast thinking, oh, the plight of animals in the Amazon, that's"
00:55:19,00:55:20,why I remembered.
00:55:20,00:55:29,They're thinking idiot shoved his head in a snake.
00:55:29,00:55:30,"OK, that's it."
00:55:30,00:55:31,That is all of our facts.
