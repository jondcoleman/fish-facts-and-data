00:01:28,00:01:32,British Royal Navy ships. So if you imagine a kind of acorn or lemon-shaped thing that's
00:01:32,00:01:36,"big enough to keep one man in, and that floats just under the water, and then it's got a little"
00:01:36,00:01:39,"knobbly bit on the top that sticks above the water with windows in, and you put your head"
00:01:39,00:01:41,"up in that bit, so you can see the ships."
00:01:41,00:01:45,"And it's the first submarine to use water as ballast, so when it needed to sink, it has"
00:01:45,00:01:47,"water pumped in, and then you can pump it out again."""
00:01:47,00:01:51,"""But the person who would claim to have built the first submarine is Cornelius van"

00:01:57,00:02:02,"thing, I think, where the way his submarine worked is that it was like a boat, but with a roof"
00:02:02,00:02:07,"over the top. And under each seat there was a huge pig's bladder, and the pig's bladder"
00:02:07,00:02:12,"was filled up with water, and when it was filled up with water, then it would sink, so that"
00:02:12,00:02:16,would be what waited it all the way down. And then I think they would just squeeze the
00:02:16,00:02:19,"pig's bladder so that they emptied in order to rise to the surface again, didn't they?"

00:12:35,00:12:38,"""And it turns out being president seems to just entail playing golf."""
00:12:38,00:12:44,"""I did see a really funny anti-Obama website called Obama Golf Counter, and you go onto"
00:12:44,00:12:50,it and it just slowly tallies up how many days he's played Jalfon and it just has audio
00:12:50,00:12:55,"of him, just in a loop, about 12 different versions of him going, I will not rest until"
00:12:55,00:13:00,"in an example of like, you know, ISIS so taken down, I will not rest, and it's just counting"
00:13:00,00:13:02,"up and out the amount of days he's played golf."""
00:13:02,00:13:06,"""But you're not resting if you're playing golf, it's very physical stuff."""
00:13:06,00:13:09,"""It's extremely mind-driven, it's yeah."""
00:13:09,00:13:13,"""So just to state how ridiculous he popular is among presidents, there have only been three"
00:13:13,00:13:18,"presidents in the 20th century who weren't golf fanatics and they were Herbert Hoover,"
00:13:18,00:13:22,who just felt it was disrespectful during the Depression. And actually I think George
00:13:22,00:13:26,"Bush did a similar thing when America was at war in Afghanistan and Iraq, he said it"
00:13:26,00:13:31,"was disrespectful, so he gave up golf."" ""Did Trump not do that quite recently? So Trump's"
00:13:31,00:13:35,"making golf costs in Scotland, isn't he? And he went to look at it and they said, ""Oh,"

00:13:39,00:13:43,"with a golf club in my hand because I'm slagging off Obama that he's playing, so I don't"
00:13:43,00:13:47,"want to be seen playing golf."" ""Yeah, I see. And then the only other two are Harry Truman"
00:13:47,00:13:51,"and Jimmy Carter, and all the other presidents of the 20th century and 21st century have"
00:13:51,00:13:52,"been obsessed with golf."""
00:13:52,00:13:55,"Woodrow Wilson, apparently, had the Secret Service paint his golf balls black, so he could"
00:13:55,00:13:59,"play them in the White House. ""I thought I was in the snow."" ""It was in the snow."""

00:14:18,00:14:24,"""He's on the $100,000 bill, which was only circulated for a few months, I believe. It"

00:14:29,00:14:36,"mention that because I just read that in 2004, a woman in Georgia, in a place called Covington,"

00:14:44,00:14:49,"bill, that had just been made. It's got the Statue of Liberty's head on it in place of where"
00:14:49,00:14:55,"a president should be, and police quickly arrested her."" ""What kind of change did you think you"

00:15:01,00:15:05,"was in love with the Lake Districts, which I thought was quite bizarre."" ""The British Lake"

00:15:09,00:15:13,"and from the north of England, his mum was born in Carlisle and he visited the Lake"
00:15:13,00:15:18,District for the first time in 1896 and he went there five times altogether. So he was
00:15:18,00:15:22,a cycling fanatic. A lot of people say he was the first person in the state of North Carolina
00:15:22,00:15:30,"to get on a bike, but we used to do that."" ""They all own them."" ""What was too scared of that?"""

00:15:37,00:15:43,"he was the first man to own and ride a rally bike in North Carolina, but he used to go to"
00:15:43,00:15:48,"the Lake District and do these long cycle rides, so he did one from Glasgow to Carlisle when"
00:15:48,00:15:53,Scotland came back down and then Kessik to Grassmeer and this is what he loved. And before
00:15:53,00:15:57,"he died, he was planning his sixth trip and then he popped his gloves instead."""
00:15:57,00:16:01,"So this afternoon, instead of researching, I've been watching the Olympics Golf and this"
00:16:01,00:16:07,is the first time that golf's been in the Olympics Rages and Ages and Ages. The last
00:16:07,00:16:15,"time was in 1904. It was at St. Louis and there were 77 players, 74 of them were American and"
00:16:15,00:16:21,three of them were Canadian and a Canadian won. And is that why they stopped doing it? America
00:16:21,00:16:27,just shut down golf for a century. It was a guy called George Lyon. He was in his midforties
00:16:27,00:16:34,"and he only took up the game age 38 and the following Olympics in 1908, they were going"
00:16:34,00:16:40,to have a competition but none of the players from the Royal Nation could decide what the
00:16:40,00:16:45,format would be and so everyone withdrew. The only person who didn't withdraw was George
00:16:45,00:16:50,"Lyon again and they offered him the gold medal but he decided, ""Well, I'm not playing so"
00:16:50,00:16:51,"I don't really deserve it, so he didn't get it."""
00:16:51,00:16:55,"That is, I think that's really mean on George Lyon. How annoyed would you be if all these"
00:16:55,00:16:57,"people just didn't bother? It's bad, isn't it?"
00:16:57,00:17:03,It's robbing him of his glory. Isn't the Olympic Golf Course being overrun by capybarras?
00:17:03,00:17:07,I saw someone tweet a picture because I think they built it on a nature reserve or on a
00:17:07,00:17:10,bit of a swamp that's in a nature reserve and there are capybarras popping up or not.
00:17:10,00:17:13,The real story is that the capybarras nature has been overrun by golfers.
00:17:13,00:17:18,"Well, that's what they've got to do on their golf course."
00:17:18,00:17:25,"Jeremy, sorry, Jeremy Kyle. It was about Jeremy Kyle. I read it into you with him. In"
00:17:25,00:17:28,"fact, I read it into you with his wife and he licks his golf balls before he takes a"
00:17:28,00:17:32,shot each time because he says he doesn't want to get his golf towel. His white golf
00:17:32,00:17:38,"towel dirty. Often when you go on play golf, it will say do not lick your balls and that's"
00:17:38,00:17:43,because they use a lot of chemicals on the greens to make the greens grow and a lot of them
00:17:43,00:17:46,are quite poisonous so you can get really sick by licking your golf.
00:17:46,00:17:52,There's a genuinely aside that says do not lick your balls quite often. I think it's done
00:17:52,00:17:56,knowingly. Is it a habit that people have? Is this not abnormal then for people to lick
00:17:56,00:18:03,"their golf balls? If you had a little bit of mud on your balls, just one ball in fact because"
00:18:03,00:18:06,you only use one. If you had a bit of mud on then you just wanted to clean it then you might
00:18:06,00:18:10,lick your finger and just wipe off the mud and then next time you get some more mud on it
00:18:10,00:18:13,"so you lick your finger again. If I have a muddy finger, I'll wash my hands."
00:18:13,00:18:16,They don't bring soap and sinks around a golf course with you.
00:18:16,00:18:23,President Eisenhower was on the board of the Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia
00:18:23,00:18:26,and there's a tree on this golf course that he kept hitting so he thought it was in the way.
00:18:26,00:18:30,So during the ball meeting he asked if it could be chopped down and the chairman was too embarrassed
00:18:30,00:18:33,to just say no because he was the president so instead he just immediately ended the meeting.
00:18:33,00:18:38,Really? That was a stop and a half. I'm pretty sure that tree got hit by lightning or something.
00:18:38,00:18:41,I storm I think. That's the official story.
00:18:41,00:18:50,"Yeah, hit by lightning. What happened to the chairman? He was hit by lightning."
00:18:53,00:18:58,Just very quickly I was just looking at the hobbies of the two presidents who didn't like golf to see
00:18:58,00:19:03,"what they did in their spare time. So one of them was Truman, a woman once wrote to President Truman"
00:19:03,00:19:08,asking what he did in his spare time and there was a reply from his spokesperson who said
00:19:08,00:19:12,"""The president has no hobbies and his official duties leave him little time for recreation."
00:19:12,00:19:16,"Most of his activities are reported in the daily newspapers where no doubt you're afraid of them."""
00:19:16,00:19:21,That's the end of Truman's no hobby. That's a really good reply isn't it? That's what you want.
00:19:21,00:19:27,"Busy making the country run, yeah. I don't want that at all. It's nippy though. It is a bit nippy but the"
00:19:27,00:19:32,"other one is much better. So Jimmy Carter, my favorite president anyway, is into woodwork but really"
00:19:32,00:19:39,into woodwork. So he makes all this furniture and he sells it. So he's made loads of cradles. He made
00:19:39,00:19:45,a full poster bed that he sold for a quarter of a million dollars. He made a cradle in 2007 that he
00:19:45,00:19:50,sold for 320 thousand dollars. Now it is possible there's a slight inflation on these prices given
00:19:50,00:19:55,that it's made by Jimmy Carter and the money goes to charity. I doubt it. But I think it's just good
00:19:55,00:20:01,quality projects. I read about Lyndon B. Johnson apparently according to Forbes an article on
00:20:01,00:20:09,that. His hobby was drunk driving around his property. Yeah he had a ranch and he liked to drink
00:20:09,00:20:15,drive around there and especially he had an amphibious car which he would pretend that he was
00:20:15,00:20:23,accidentally driving into a lake. He would do that with guests right. And then they'd be fine.
00:20:23,00:20:30,Quiz question about Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter is the 39th president of the United States
00:20:30,00:20:34,America. What first does he bring as a president and this is something to do with his personal life?
00:20:34,00:20:39,First woodwork expert. That's probably I've definitely phrased this question. Was he the first to write
00:20:39,00:20:46,a children's book? No. He was the first to put a bowling lane in the White House. No. Basically he's
00:20:46,00:20:53,the first president to have been born in a hospital. 39th president. I love them were born in wood cabins
00:20:53,00:21:06,when they were all built by him. Okay it is time for fact number three and that is my fact. My fact
00:21:06,00:21:13,is that when the poets Shelley and Byron went on a rider's retreat to Lake Geneva in 1816 the hotel
00:21:13,00:21:20,opposite them hired out telescopes to their guests so that they could spy on them. It's so surreal.
00:21:20,00:21:26,So this by the way was a very very famous trip that Shelley and Byron had made because they
00:21:26,00:21:31,they were sat in the house one night and there were lots of storms that were going on for about
00:21:31,00:21:37,three days solid and it's during one of those storms that Shelley's girlfriend at the time Mary
00:21:37,00:21:42,and Byron and Shelley started coming up with ghost stories and scary stories horror stories and
00:21:42,00:21:47,that's where Frankenstein was born. So the five guests there were three great writers and then two really
00:21:47,00:21:52,tragic figures. One of whom was Claire Claremont who was Byron's Flues who he'd impregnated and he
00:21:52,00:21:57,really wanted her to stop trying to get off with him and she followed him there and so he invited this
00:21:57,00:22:02,other guy his doctor called Polidori to act as like a third wheel to make sure that Claire didn't get
00:22:02,00:22:07,a chance to get Byron in a corner and snog him whatever and yeah Polidori had the most awful time
00:22:07,00:22:11,with Byron employed us his doctor and they were asked to write these ghost stories on this night by
00:22:11,00:22:17,and challenged him to write a ghost story and Polidori wrote this story and wrote the first ever vampire
00:22:17,00:22:22,story in the English language and he just kind of forgot about it. He sent it to a friend when he
00:22:22,00:22:28,got back to the UK and it got lost somewhere and then a few years later it got published in this monthly
00:22:28,00:22:33,magazine just under the title of the vampire tale by Lord Byron and so Polidori has spent you know
00:22:33,00:22:39,many years being so jealous of Byron and hating him resenting him and then he finds that this one
00:22:39,00:22:42,story is written as published under Byron's name. I like that sort of as a ghost story that was
00:22:42,00:22:48,"accidentally ghost written. Yeah. Not really a ghost story because there's no ghost in it. Yeah,"
00:22:48,00:22:54,"but yeah. Anyway, let's get back to this hotel. What's quite amazing about it is A, I didn't realize"
00:22:54,00:23:00,celebrity paparazzi things were going on back then. I think Byron is often credited as being a part of
00:23:00,00:23:04,"the birth of that whole session. Yeah, one of the first boop rumble as well. Yeah, he was basically"
00:23:04,00:23:11,the Anna Winter of the time. He was defining fashion purely by what he would write as reports of
00:23:11,00:23:17,"a sort of vanity therapy or a party. Yeah, exactly. Right. So they found not too long ago in the last"
00:23:17,00:23:24,couple of years the addition of Frankenstein that Mary Shelley signed for Byron. So she sent
00:23:24,00:23:28,him a letter saying I'd love to hear if you think this is a good book. He never sent back a comment.
00:23:28,00:23:33,And then he then wrote someone asked him about the book and he wrote his opinion to them in that and
00:23:33,00:23:39,he said me thinks it's a wonderful work for a girl of 19. So he did like it but kind of patronizingly
00:23:39,00:23:45,I don't know. Was it anyone who still sends it with me things? I know. I thought it was like it's George
00:23:45,00:23:54,"our binks. Oh, yeah. It's things. Wonderful. Oh, God, I know. She was pretty weird actually,"
00:23:54,00:23:59,"Mary Shelley. What's she? Well, I think she did a couple of weird things. So Percy drowned"
00:23:59,00:24:06,"in a shipwreck. After he died, she bought this Clifftop house in Bournemouth and this was in 1851"
00:24:06,00:24:11,and then she moved there with her children but she also moved the remains of her parents there.
00:24:11,00:24:15,"So her parents were buried in their King's Cross and she was just like, well, I'm moving. I guess"
00:24:15,00:24:19,"I'll just bring my parents along. Oh, you mean as soon she dug up the graves? Yeah. She had the graves"
00:24:19,00:24:23,"dug up and had them re-buried in Bournemouth. Isn't that strange? Yeah. Well, she also kept"
00:24:23,00:24:30,Percy Shelley's heart in her desk. So the rumor goes. I don't think we have any evidence of that.
00:24:30,00:24:33,"Okay, because I think that more modern historians would say they actually think it was Shelley's liver"
00:24:33,00:24:37,that they mistaken for a heart. I think the story was told by one of Shelley's friends was that when
00:24:37,00:24:42,"Shelley was being cremated, his friend dived into the fire and seized the heart. So it's probably"
00:24:42,00:24:45,possible that he would have accidentally seized the liver because they weren't very anatomically good
00:24:45,00:24:49,then anyway and there's a big fire in the way. So I guess he just went for the first organ and he could
00:24:49,00:24:54,"get his hands on. Yeah, who knows. Byron had a coffin at the end of his dining table. They really"
00:24:54,00:25:00,kind of loved that kind of stuff. He used to get skulls and have them converted into drinking cups.
00:25:00,00:25:04,"Yeah, drinking cups. Yeah, drinking cups. In fact, he wanted Percy Shelley's skull as well. You jumped"
00:25:04,00:25:11,into the fire. Yeah. He accidentally brought his femur out. They were worried. I've got a straw.
00:25:11,00:25:20,I talk about my favourite spice satellite and telescope. You've been listening to all this literature.
00:25:20,00:25:25,"All I know, if you've got more literature. No, no, no. The corona spice satellites of reconnaissance"
00:25:25,00:25:28,"satellites, they were kind of made in the 60s and 70s and they were one of the first reconnaissance"
00:25:28,00:25:33,satellites we put up into space and they had cameras in them but they were normal code act film cameras.
00:25:33,00:25:37,"So when all the pictures had been taken, the satellite would jettison out a canister of film"
00:25:37,00:25:40,which would fall to earth and so it would come through the atmosphere and then a parachute would
00:25:40,00:25:44,open so it would be crashing down and then a plane would fly alongside it and grab it out of the air.
00:25:44,00:25:51,"That is unbelievable. I know. What? What? Why? Yeah, why would you fly alongside it and not"
00:25:51,00:25:55,"just wait for it to land? Well, it meant that it was safe of because you could go to risk of some"
00:25:55,00:26:00,or pick it up but there were there were examples of them not catching it in mid air and they landed
00:26:00,00:26:03,like farmers land and stuff and they used to write the words top secret on it but they stopped doing
00:26:03,00:26:09,that because everyone kept opening them. Have you ever seen the the capsules which the
00:26:09,00:26:15,Cosmonauts came down in and then it would say in Russian person inside to be not be scared
00:26:15,00:26:20,this is not an alien. It's a Cosmonauts car. It's amazing. It said that this is not an alien.
00:26:20,00:26:23,"It's something like that. It's like, yeah, it's like, do you not be alarmed? Then maybe a person inside"
00:26:23,00:26:32,"please help people water and stuff. Do not lick balls. Yeah. Andrew Hunter Murray, who's away at the"
00:26:32,00:26:38,"moment, he was telling me that NASA have a telescope on a plane so they fly the plane up and then they"
00:26:38,00:26:43,start observing through a telescope on the plane. Do you have this on the list? I only put my top one
00:26:43,00:26:51,because I didn't think you'd listen to me for that long. I read an article from 1998 and it was about
00:26:51,00:26:58,"people buying telescopes in New York and 5,000 people had bought a telescope but because of the pollution"
00:26:58,00:27:04,you can't see any stars. And so they asked a lot of these people why have you bought telescopes and
00:27:04,00:27:09,the most common answer was to spy on my neighbours. Really? Yeah. There was a survey done in Switzerland
00:27:09,00:27:14,that asked people if they spied on their neighbours and 22% of people admitted that they did
00:27:14,00:27:19,actively use equipment like binoculars or camera phones or through the spy holes in their door
00:27:19,00:27:24,and they were asked why they spied on their neighbours and in Switzerland the most popular reason for
00:27:24,00:27:31,spying was to check out a neighbour's plants. 28% of people... That feels like a swiss you for this.
00:27:31,00:27:38,They did the same study in the UK and a third of people said they spied on their neighbours and in
00:27:38,00:27:44,the UK the most commonly given reason is to check their all right. It's to check open brackets if
00:27:44,00:27:55,they're a bit of close brackets. All right. Okay it is time for a final fact of the show and that is
00:27:55,00:28:01,Chuzenski. My fact this week is that famous historical games of Go include the blood vomiting
00:28:01,00:28:09,"game, the ear reddening game, the famous killing game and the atomic bomb game. So this is about the"
00:28:09,00:28:14,game Go which is a very famous game comes from China originally. It's the oldest board game in the
00:28:14,00:28:19,world that's still being played. That's not Pokemon Go then. Sorry no that's obviously one of the oldest
00:28:19,00:28:25,games in the world still being played. It feels like to some of us but no and there have been games
00:28:25,00:28:29,documented throughout history for hundreds of hundreds of years and there are these famous
00:28:29,00:28:34,historical games. So what were they again? So the blood vomiting game. Okay so what happens in
00:28:34,00:28:39,the blood vomiting game? It's a lot like it sounds and it was in 1835 and it was a game where there were
00:28:39,00:28:43,two players one was beating the other and then the other had these four spectacular moves and
00:28:43,00:28:48,the first move was a move that his school of Go had been planning for months and months. So he won
00:28:48,00:28:53,that and then the next three moves were given to him by Ghosts. So he won those three as well because
00:28:53,00:28:59,Ghosts came down and helped him out so he won that game. I read that sentence and I just sat back and
00:28:59,00:29:03,just let it soak in. It's the most enjoyable little nugget I've read in a fact for a very long time.
00:29:03,00:29:07,How is that not cheating? I don't understand how that's allowed. Because in Go it turns out that
00:29:07,00:29:12,you are allowed help from other people you just need to pause the game. Just to jump forward very
00:29:12,00:29:15,quickly I think we should stick on the blood vomiting game for a minute. But to jump forward to the
00:29:15,00:29:21,ear reddening game that game took three months to play. Yeah. Took three months because each player was
00:29:21,00:29:28,allowed a 24 hour period of thinking time in between each move and they took it. We're a spectator sport
00:29:28,00:29:34,if you want a day ticket. Okay. And what they would do in that 24 hour periods is often the person
00:29:34,00:29:40,who was playing would go back into there wherever they lived and they would have a group of students
00:29:40,00:29:45,study the game up to the point it was at. And they would then decide on what potential new moves could
00:29:45,00:29:50,be done. The next move. And just to finish off the blood vomiting game. Penny was still wondering
00:29:50,00:29:55,"about the name. So as this guy started to lose he keeled over, collapsed on the board and started"
00:29:55,00:30:00,coughing up blood and he was dead within a couple of months. I thought he probably had TB but it
00:30:00,00:30:04,might have been just the pain of losing. And the ear reddening game that Dan mentioned is called
00:30:04,00:30:11,that this is an 1846 it was a hot century for go but in 1846 it was a game that a doctor happened to be
00:30:11,00:30:15,watching and everyone else who was watching it thought the one guy would lose and the doctor said no
00:30:15,00:30:20,I think the other guy is going to lose and people said why? And he said because I saw his ears flush red
00:30:20,00:30:24,when his opponent made a move and that means he's distressed. And then DT was right so that's the
00:30:24,00:30:29,ear reddening game. And then sadly the famous killing game is just a really intense game. Wow so
00:30:29,00:30:36,he glowed under stress as well. Like the space crest. That's amazing. Maybe that's how you stress out
00:30:36,00:30:42,a bit of crest. You just beat it at go. Should we quickly explain what go is? Yes. Just very very simply
00:30:42,00:30:49,it's a board game a bit like chess or drafts and each player has white or black pebbles and you put
00:30:49,00:30:54,them on the board. It's quite complicated but the basic thing is you're trying to encircle your
00:30:54,00:31:01,opponent's pieces and get territory. Yeah encircle bits of territory and it's like one go at a time
00:31:01,00:31:07,and it's incredibly simple the rules but very complex as James says to get good at it the strategy
00:31:07,00:31:12,is completely complex. And the the famous thing recently is it's really hard for computers to play
00:31:12,00:31:18,because there are so many different possible combinations of moves and one move that you do now
00:31:18,00:31:23,in a hundred days time could be really important in ways that you haven't foreseen
00:31:23,00:31:28,and so the computers can't work it out although recently I think they might have won that thing. Yeah
00:31:28,00:31:33,I think this was a bit of a blow for the go community but AlphaGo which is made by Google's
00:31:33,00:31:39,artificial intelligence arm and it's AlphaGo this thing that beat this Korean guy Lee Sedol
00:31:39,00:31:43,and then so Lee Sedol is currently ranked fourth in the world and the person who's ranked first in
00:31:43,00:31:49,the world is called KG and I'm really sorry that's mispronounced. He's 18 and he said when he saw
00:31:49,00:31:54,AlphaGo being so good I don't want to play AlphaGo because I know that I'm better than AlphaGo
00:31:54,00:31:58,I've watched as much as with Lee and AlphaGo is weaker than me and I don't want him stealing my moves
00:31:58,00:32:03,so he's backed out of it so it's quite familiar from when I used to play chess as a child and my little
00:32:03,00:32:08,brother started beating me and so I kept playing until I beat him once and said well now I'm the
00:32:08,00:32:15,reigning champion I don't want to play anymore. But if you look at the rankings I think they're on
00:32:15,00:32:21,"official rankings but you can look at say the top 200 or whatever and they're all from either China,"
00:32:21,00:32:29,Japan or Korea apart from the world number two which is AlphaGo which is technically a British player.
00:32:29,00:32:34,Woohoo! So we're number two in the world. That's very good. Yeah. Can I bring up another game that you
00:32:34,00:32:39,mentioned in the headline facts? Yes sorry the atomic bomb game. The atomic bomb game. This is amazing.
00:32:39,00:32:44,So they were in Hiroshima they were in the outer suburbs they were about five kilometers from
00:32:44,00:32:50,where impact ground zero was through the bomb detonating. So they were mid-game and suddenly the bomb
00:32:50,00:32:55,goes off and there was damage to their building people were injured around them. This is what's
00:32:55,00:33:02,remarkable. They resumed play after a lunch break and then it was by the police coming around saying
00:33:02,00:33:07,you need to go elsewhere and they just went further out to continue the game. Just on artificial
00:33:07,00:33:11,intelligence and computers that we were talking about as James was saying goes quite a hard game to
00:33:11,00:33:15,beat with a computer. There is a game that was specifically designed to be difficult for a computer
00:33:15,00:33:21,beat by a guy called Omar Sayed who was inspired by watching Deep Blue defeat Casper off. So he
00:33:21,00:33:25,invented this game called Arima which is it can be played on a chess board and it's basically a bit
00:33:25,00:33:29,like chess but there are different pieces. There's like an elephant and a camel and a horse and
00:33:29,00:33:33,dogs and cats. The idea is that it's supposed to be difficult for computers to play but easy for
00:33:33,00:33:38,humans and because the computer can't use kind of like tree logic by looking up every single
00:33:38,00:33:41,different combination and then working out the best one is by comparing them all. It's slightly
00:33:41,00:33:46,intuitive but just like that a computer eventually won in 2013 they had an international competition
00:33:46,00:33:50,every year there were three competitions there would be a human only competition a computer only
00:33:50,00:33:56,competition and then the third one where computers versus humans and for ages computers always lost
00:33:56,00:34:01,and then in 2015 they won. It would be good if they had Olympic boxing and then robot was and then
00:34:01,00:34:07,the best Olympic boxer fought against the best robot was guy. Well they do robot football slash
00:34:07,00:34:15,soccer now don't they and they do have the robots play a human team and Leven Skryra who is a very good
00:34:15,00:34:21,friend of ours been on the show a few times. He reckons that by 2050 the robots will beat the human
00:34:21,00:34:29,team. Yeah he does say that although they do look hilariously bad. It's like just putting a bunch of
00:34:29,00:34:35,pigs into a football arena and say try and score they just have no interest in scoring they have
00:34:35,00:34:40,no anything they're just running into walls. And pigs do play football sometimes don't they?
00:34:40,00:34:45,I knew I knew I'd say something that would I would hope make no sense and James would come in saying
00:34:45,00:34:49,actually. I think by law you're supposed to give them things to play with because they get bored
00:34:49,00:34:53,and quite often they give them balls and they kind of like to nuzzle them around and I'm pretty
00:34:53,00:34:57,sure I've seen a video of pigs playing football. Well maybe they're just looking them because I think
00:34:57,00:35:07,it's good luck. Okay that's it that's all of our facts thank you so much for listening if you would
