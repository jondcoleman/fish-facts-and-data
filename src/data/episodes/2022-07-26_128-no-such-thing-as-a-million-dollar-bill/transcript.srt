1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,180
 "Did you know what that would look like, isn't it?"

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,860
 "Did you know what that would look like, isn't it?"

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:19,640
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing As A Fish" a weekly podcast

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,700
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,240
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anichesinsky Alex Bell and James

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,360
 Tarkin. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,600
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Alex

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
 Bell.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,200
 My fact this week is that the controls in the world's first combat submarine were lit up

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,700
 with glowing mushrooms.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,700
 "That is disgusting."

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,700
 "Amazing."

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,660
 "When you say the controls, with the controls themselves, the mushrooms? Or, I don't know

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,660
 of the amazing."

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,880
 "It was actually like in your car at nighttime when you're driving all the dials kind of

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
 lights up."

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
 "Yes."

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,360
 "It was literally the little needles on the dials and things that had tiny bits of

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,320
 foxfire, which is the type of bioluminescent fungi attached to them."

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,160
 "I think foxfire is what Americans call any kind of glowing fungus, and it comes from

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,560
 fox more like foe as in fake, fake fire."

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,000
 "He used to call it cold fire, didn't they? I think maybe Aristotle or someone said

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 it's cold fire.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 When was this submarine?"

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,240
 "This was something called the turtle. It was more of a submersible, it looked like a

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,680
 giant lemon, a one-man submersible. It was built in 1775 in America and it was to fight

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,900
 British Royal Navy ships. So if you imagine a kind of acorn or lemon-shaped thing that's

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,000
 big enough to keep one man in, and that floats just under the water, and then it's got a little

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,040
 knobbly bit on the top that sticks above the water with windows in, and you put your head

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,040
 up in that bit, so you can see the ships.

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,320
 And it's the first submarine to use water as ballast, so when it needed to sink, it has

32
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,400
 water pumped in, and then you can pump it out again."

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,680
 "But the person who would claim to have built the first submarine is Cornelius van

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,080
 Drebel, and that was at the very start of the 17th century. And he sort of did the same

35
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,600
 thing, I think, where the way his submarine worked is that it was like a boat, but with a roof

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,760
 over the top. And under each seat there was a huge pig's bladder, and the pig's bladder

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,540
 was filled up with water, and when it was filled up with water, then it would sink, so that

38
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,320
 would be what waited it all the way down. And then I think they would just squeeze the

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,760
 pig's bladder so that they emptied in order to rise to the surface again, didn't they?

40
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,320
 "So if you're sitting on your seat and you had to go up to the surface again, you just like

41
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,040
 pushed down really, really hard on your seat, and then the water pumped out of the pig's

42
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
 bladder."

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
 "Like a whoopee cushion?"

44
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
 "Exactly like a whoopee cushion."

45
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
 "Did it make the noise?"

46
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,120
 "Hopefully, just to amuse the fish, but then that would give away your location to the

47
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
 enemy."

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,880
 "So obviously this is pre-electricity. Did they use bioluminescent, fungi for any other

49
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,040
 kind of household lighting? I mean, it's weird that they cracked the idea that you could

50
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,520
 use this in a submarine, but not use it in homes."

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,880
 "I know that the Scandinavians were supposed to have used it at nighttime during the long sort

52
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,760
 of winter nights, and there was a guy in the 1600s who wrote that Indonesians used fungus

53
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,320
 as improvised torches, and also micro-nesians used to put bioluminescent fungus onto their

54
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,320
 clothes, like for sort of rays."

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,000
 "I think they still do. I think they still decorate their faces and their headdresses with

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,280
 glowing mushrooms to scare people. That would scare me. It would, yeah. Hopefully you just

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,280
 get a massive mushroom of hope in every battle."

58
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,200
 "So I was looking into things that glow on earth, and one of the things I found was there's

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,320
 all these forests that glow with bioluminescence, fungi as well, and I've just never seen it before

60
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,640
 and you can see pictures online, it's stunning. It does look like you've gone into laser quest,

61
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
 but a forest."

62
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,160
 "And we only found out exactly the mechanism by which they glow a couple of years ago,

63
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,840
 I think, although it's just a chemical process that I didn't understand anyway, but we didn't

64
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,120
 know until a couple of years ago, and now that means that hopefully we can replicate it and

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,920
 they're thinking about using it in street lighting. I think there's a Dutch designer called

66
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,840
 Dan Ruzegard, whose name I will have mispronounced, and yet he's looking at bioluminescent creatures

67
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
 in order to make street lamps."

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,000
 "I mean, the one day we might plant street lamps, and they'll just grow. That'd be cool."

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 "That'd be pretty good, wouldn't it?"

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 "Yeah."

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,960
 "The glowing plants in the ISS, in the International Space Station, yeah, remember we spoke about the

72
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,920
 crests that they were making up in space? Well, the crests, they genetically modified, so it would

73
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,440
 glow a different colour if it was feeling stressed, because that's what they wanted to do, they

74
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,800
 wanted to test the stress levels of plants."

75
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
 "Crestress."

76
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
 "Crestress?"

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
 "Crestress."

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,640
 "So they managed to make these glow so they could be like, "Oh, it's really stressed, but they

79
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,880
 were actually pushing the stress on the crest as well. They wanted to see how far they

80
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,880
 could push it before it starts withering and..."

81
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
 "So it can't happen anymore."

82
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,680
 "Yeah, yeah, sending back down is not doing a little bit of stress on crest."

83
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,440
 "I guess, by putting it in space, I'm most important crest, I've got a really poor job."

84
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,720
 "Yeah, I think it's kind of lack of water would be stressful for plants or poor soil. I remember

85
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,280
 once reading that if clover is stressed, then it grows extra leaves because it needs to

86
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,100
 get more nutrients. And so if you see a four-leaved clover, it's more likely to come from

87
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,100
 a stressed environment."

88
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,460
 "Oh, really? It's actually an upset clover. It's terrible luck. It's good luck for you, but

89
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,460
 bad luck for the clover."

90
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,460
 "Oh, no, that's so sad."

91
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:19,260
 "Oh, wow. That's just really interesting. Yeah. That's what we're for, darling."

92
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,500
 "Finally, 130 shows in. That's what's going on."

93
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,180
 On mushrooms and fungi, some fungi make a noise when they release their spores. So there's

94
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,260
 a fungi called the Devil's Sagar, and it only exists in a really remote place in the middle

95
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,060
 of Texas and in Japan. But apparently, it makes a weird whistling noise.

96
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,060
 "Oh, yeah, okay."

97
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,060
 "What did you think?"

98
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,420
 "Well, you were saying all that. I was just trying to imagine what kind of noise is it,

99
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,420
 okay?"

100
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,420
 "I just won't be hilarious."

101
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,420
 "It was just like..."

102
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,420
 "It's just a little fog."

103
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,580
 "I was thinking more like tennis groan."

104
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,580
 "Oh!"

105
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,580
 "Sex, mate."

106
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:58,580
 "Well, that's what they're doing, aren't they? They're releasing spores. They all have

107
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,580
 into sex, I think."

108
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,660
 "No, they sure are. But they're more like masturbating, I think, because you're putting

109
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,740
 it out there, aren't you?"

110
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,340
 "Yeah, you're right. Although, I think masturbating, you're not kind of throwing your sperm out there

111
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,820
 in the hope that it collects someone's, does that know why you do it? I hope that it finds

112
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,820
 an egg somewhere."

113
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,820
 "So I am not allowed back to the sperm doing every hospital."

114
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,660
 "There is a famous thing about giraffes when they have sex. They can't always mount each

115
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,300
 other correctly. And so they often ejaculate, and their ejaculate is kind of lighter than

116
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,740
 there and drifts around. So, sometimes if you go to some zoos, there could be like little

117
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,420
 strands of giraffe ejaculate from their arse. Is that like the equivalent of a bride throwing

118
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,420
 a bouquet?"

119
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,500
 "Do they just chuck it into the wind and see which fiefel giraffe goes through?"

120
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
 "No, no."

121
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
 "Addling it out."

122
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
 "Some fiefel giraffe."

123
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,540
 "But underwater is the same, isn't it? Lots of species of things under water released

124
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,580
 there, but just into the water when there aren't fiefels around. And the assumption

125
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,580
 it'll get somewhere."

126
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,580
 "Curls."

127
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,420
 "Fungus, actually, is weird that you suggested the farting sound because fungi do make their

128
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,340
 own wind. So they generate their own weather. And this is a way that they disperse their spores.

129
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,700
 And so they've looked into this with oyster and shittaki mushrooms. And what they do is

130
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,860
 they give off water vapor. And that cools down the air just above them. And that makes

131
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,180
 this convection current, which makes the air, as if you remember, the old GCSE physics

132
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,580
 kind of spin around. And so the convection current means that the spores get blown further

133
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,580
 away.

134
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,700
 "That's like the opposite of sweating because we sweat in order for air to evaporate it,

135
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,980
 so it cools us down. But they're sweating in order to make the air move."

136
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,780
 "Yes, it's like an alternative to sweating. I don't know if it's the exact opposite.

137
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,140
 The exact opposite is like sucking in salty water."

138
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,660
 James always says that when you're in a club, there's almost a weather system above you

139
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
 in a club.

140
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,180
 "People have been to clubs, I'm sure, where it's so hot and sweaty that it starts raining

141
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
 sweat from the sea."

142
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,180
 "So is it like that?"

143
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,340
 "Yes, it's like a disgusting cloud of mushroom sweat."

144
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,340
 "But a single, fungy, creating."

145
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,740
 "Yeah, there are lots of them there. I guess you get a big cloud, a big sweat cloud of

146
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,740
 spores."

147
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,980
 "You guys always say that I'm wrong to be disgusted by mushrooms. But the more I hear about

148
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,100
 the sweat rain, the more I think, yeah, they're lovely."

149
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,740
 "It's also an alternative answer to why did the mushroom go to the party to create better

150
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,580
 air flow within the rave room so that it would rain."

151
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:22,620
 "Oh, yes. That would be the answer from the mushroom expert."

152
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,220
 "Actually, the reason he got home early."

153
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:31,420
 "I think I tweeted once that because it's why did A mushroom go, he's not a fun guy, he's

154
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:37,620
 a fun Gus. It should be why did the mushroom called Gus go to the party because he was a fun

155
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,620
 Gus."

156
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,020
 "I don't want to go to any party that involves James plus an expert, but going around running

157
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,020
 jokes."

158
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:50,020
 "The fastest accelerating thing on earth is a fungus. It's known as the hat throw or the

159
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:55,780
 Duncanon fungus, and it lives on feces. It needs to blast its spores away from the feces

160
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,980
 because the way it procreates is by having its spores eaten by, let's say, cows. And cows

161
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:09,860
 do not like to eat where they defecate, like a lot of us. So they have to blast the spores

162
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,380
 far away and they accelerate to 45 miles an hour within the first millimetre. So it means

163
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,420
 the spores will travel at more than a million times their body length in one second."

164
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,820
 "Interesting what you say about cows, because I was just thinking they do eat where they

165
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,820
 shit. Don't they?"

166
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,820
 "In a field."

167
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,620
 "Yeah, so in a field. Only in the like we sometimes shit and eat in the same house."

168
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,420
 "No, no, very different because it's not often that I will be in the kitchen or at the dinner

169
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,020
 table and there's a shit next to my place."

170
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,020
 "That's true."

171
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,100
 "Is there a kind of code amongst the cows to shit on the left-hand side of the field and

172
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,100
 dinners on the right?"

173
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,180
 "That does happen with some animals. There are some burrowing animals that will have

174
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,420
 a special place where they defecate and they definitely do. They have a special toilet where

175
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
 they excrete."

176
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,220
 "Generally, for animals like that, as long as you keep a few metres away, I think you're

177
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,220
 okay."

178
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,220
 "No, it's okay, but you might see a great patch of grass and you go over and you go, oh,

179
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,220
 someone's shot on my potential dinner."

180
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,420
 "The other thing is that the shit is obviously going to make the grass grow better because

181
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,220
 the fertilization. So really, you do want to eat where you shit."

182
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:14,460
 "One cow shit is another cow dinner. As the old cow come up, goes."

183
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,580
 "Here's a really good story that I love. Jim Lovell, the man who piloted Apollo 13. I don't

184
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,380
 know if I've mentioned him in the office before."

185
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,380
 "He might come up."

186
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,140
 "Yeah, he's my absolute hero."

187
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:30,500
 "So he almost didn't make it to Apollo 13 because he almost had to go down in an airplane

188
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,180
 when he was fighting in a war because his radar got jammed. So he turns his map light

189
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,260
 on, which is inside, so that he can guide his way home, looking at all those instruments.

190
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,460
 The map light short circuits the entire cockpit. So as a result, he's got literally no light.

191
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,960
 So he looks down into the ocean and suddenly notices in the ocean this huge long trail of

192
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,840
 bioluminescence, green algae that's just lit up the ocean. And the only way that this lights

193
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,740
 up is in the wake of a massive ship going by. So basically, it's a ginormous runway leading

194
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,420
 him back home and he follows that trail and he lands back on the aircraft carrier and survives.

195
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,420
 It's extraordinary.

196
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,820
 Like, the fact that he couldn't even see it when he turned off all his normal light, every

197
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,700
 single light in the cockpit had to go off for a second room to notice it, it was so faint.

198
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,560
 So he needed all those things to go wrong, his radar to jam, to be a short circuit in

199
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,740
 the, it's extraordinary. And nature guided him home."

200
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,740
 "Yeah, it is incredible."

201
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:30,740
 "Well technically it was the aircraft carrier destroying nature. Oh yeah."

202
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,140
 "Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James."

203
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,920
 "Okay, my fact this week is that while he was president, Woodrow Wilson played more than

204
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,020
 1200 rounds of golf."

205
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,520
 "How many terms did he do?"

206
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
 "Did two terms."

207
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,980
 "So it's what, eight years?"

208
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,980
 "Yeah."

209
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:54,320
 "Presidential golf historian Don Van Natter says that it's between 1200 and 1600 and 1600

210
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,940
 goes into weight a lot more nicely, so that would be 200 rounds a year, which let's say

211
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,180
 50 weeks is four rounds a week."

212
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,660
 "And just to be clear to those of us who aren't golf knowledgeable, how long does it take

213
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,540
 to a round of golf?"

214
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,980
 "Depends, but I should think it would have taken him at least four hours if he's, you know,

215
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,980
 taking his time."

216
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,500
 "And also he wasn't very good, was he?"

217
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
 "No, he wasn't."

218
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,540
 "He was actually not very good despite all the practice, so probably did take images."

219
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,080
 "Yeah, he wasn't very good. But there's kind of a big history of American presidents playing

220
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:28,680
 golf and this particular fact came because this week Barack Obama played his 300th round

221
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,240
 and a lot of his opponents are saying, well he shouldn't be playing so much golf, he

222
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,000
 should be concentrating on being president."

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,440
 "And it turns out being president seems to just entail playing golf."

224
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,720
 "I did see a really funny anti-Obama website called Obama Golf Counter, and you go onto

225
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,760
 it and it just slowly tallies up how many days he's played Jalfon and it just has audio

226
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,820
 of him, just in a loop, about 12 different versions of him going, I will not rest until

227
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,320
 in an example of like, you know, ISIS so taken down, I will not rest, and it's just counting

228
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,760
 up and out the amount of days he's played golf."

229
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,400
 "But you're not resting if you're playing golf, it's very physical stuff."

230
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,160
 "It's extremely mind-driven, it's yeah."

231
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,760
 "So just to state how ridiculous he popular is among presidents, there have only been three

232
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,680
 presidents in the 20th century who weren't golf fanatics and they were Herbert Hoover,

233
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,360
 who just felt it was disrespectful during the Depression. And actually I think George

234
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,280
 Bush did a similar thing when America was at war in Afghanistan and Iraq, he said it

235
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,200
 was disrespectful, so he gave up golf." "Did Trump not do that quite recently? So Trump's

236
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,680
 making golf costs in Scotland, isn't he? And he went to look at it and they said, "Oh,

237
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,160
 why don't you have a few, play a few holes?" And he was like, "I don't want to be seen

238
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,040
 with a golf club in my hand because I'm slagging off Obama that he's playing, so I don't

239
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,120
 want to be seen playing golf." "Yeah, I see. And then the only other two are Harry Truman

240
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,080
 and Jimmy Carter, and all the other presidents of the 20th century and 21st century have

241
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,160
 been obsessed with golf."

242
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,600
 Woodrow Wilson, apparently, had the Secret Service paint his golf balls black, so he could

243
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,000
 play them in the White House. "I thought I was in the snow." "It was in the snow."

244
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,360
 "It was in the snow." "I don't think the White House is totally white."

245
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,880
 "Yeah." "And it sounds like the outside walls of the White House are absorbing the balls.

246
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,920
 Woodrow Wilson is on an American bill. Money bill. Didn't know that. "Is Bill Clinton?

247
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,160
 That would be good, right?" "That would be very good. No, he's not." "Was he on?"

248
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,520
 "He's on the $100,000 bill, which was only circulated for a few months, I believe. It

249
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,520
 was just you couldn't get any change." "Yeah, I was." "Well actually, Foddy, you should

250
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:36,240
 mention that because I just read that in 2004, a woman in Georgia, in a place called Covington,

251
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:44,760
 tried to pick up a 1,675 tab at her local Walmart with a forged $1 million bill, a $1 million

252
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,560
 bill, that had just been made. It's got the Statue of Liberty's head on it in place of where

253
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,400
 a president should be, and police quickly arrested her." "What kind of change did you think you

254
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,760
 were going to get from your $1 million bill at Walmart?" "On Woodrow Wilson, actually, he

255
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,480
 was in love with the Lake Districts, which I thought was quite bizarre." "The British Lake

256
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,800
 District?" "The British Lake District." So his mother, his family came from Scotland

257
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,600
 and from the north of England, his mum was born in Carlisle and he visited the Lake

258
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,000
 District for the first time in 1896 and he went there five times altogether. So he was

259
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,900
 a cycling fanatic. A lot of people say he was the first person in the state of North Carolina

260
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:30,160
 to get on a bike, but we used to do that." "They all own them." "What was too scared of that?"

261
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,940
 "Isn't the Cuxle of North Carolina rally, and they make bikes?" "It sure is!" "Whoa! Well,

262
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:43,300
 he was the first man to own and ride a rally bike in North Carolina, but he used to go to

263
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,620
 the Lake District and do these long cycle rides, so he did one from Glasgow to Carlisle when

264
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,220
 Scotland came back down and then Kessik to Grassmeer and this is what he loved. And before

265
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,860
 he died, he was planning his sixth trip and then he popped his gloves instead."

266
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,940
 So this afternoon, instead of researching, I've been watching the Olympics Golf and this

267
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,180
 is the first time that golf's been in the Olympics Rages and Ages and Ages. The last

268
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:15,700
 time was in 1904. It was at St. Louis and there were 77 players, 74 of them were American and

269
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:21,740
 three of them were Canadian and a Canadian won. And is that why they stopped doing it? America

270
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,380
 just shut down golf for a century. It was a guy called George Lyon. He was in his midforties

271
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:34,780
 and he only took up the game age 38 and the following Olympics in 1908, they were going

272
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:40,980
 to have a competition but none of the players from the Royal Nation could decide what the

273
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,560
 format would be and so everyone withdrew. The only person who didn't withdraw was George

274
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,060
 Lyon again and they offered him the gold medal but he decided, "Well, I'm not playing so

275
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,980
 I don't really deserve it, so he didn't get it."

276
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,580
 That is, I think that's really mean on George Lyon. How annoyed would you be if all these

277
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,980
 people just didn't bother? It's bad, isn't it?

278
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,340
 It's robbing him of his glory. Isn't the Olympic Golf Course being overrun by capybarras?

279
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,660
 I saw someone tweet a picture because I think they built it on a nature reserve or on a

280
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,540
 bit of a swamp that's in a nature reserve and there are capybarras popping up or not.

281
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,540
 The real story is that the capybarras nature has been overrun by golfers.

282
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,060
 Well, that's what they've got to do on their golf course.

283
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:25,260
 Jeremy, sorry, Jeremy Kyle. It was about Jeremy Kyle. I read it into you with him. In

284
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,620
 fact, I read it into you with his wife and he licks his golf balls before he takes a

285
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,860
 shot each time because he says he doesn't want to get his golf towel. His white golf

286
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:38,460
 towel dirty. Often when you go on play golf, it will say do not lick your balls and that's

287
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,260
 because they use a lot of chemicals on the greens to make the greens grow and a lot of them

288
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,780
 are quite poisonous so you can get really sick by licking your golf.

289
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,140
 There's a genuinely aside that says do not lick your balls quite often. I think it's done

290
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,940
 knowingly. Is it a habit that people have? Is this not abnormal then for people to lick

291
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:03,020
 their golf balls? If you had a little bit of mud on your balls, just one ball in fact because

292
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,540
 you only use one. If you had a bit of mud on then you just wanted to clean it then you might

293
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,460
 lick your finger and just wipe off the mud and then next time you get some more mud on it

294
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,740
 so you lick your finger again. If I have a muddy finger, I'll wash my hands.

295
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,620
 They don't bring soap and sinks around a golf course with you.

296
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:23,100
 President Eisenhower was on the board of the Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia

297
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,700
 and there's a tree on this golf course that he kept hitting so he thought it was in the way.

298
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,460
 So during the ball meeting he asked if it could be chopped down and the chairman was too embarrassed

299
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,900
 to just say no because he was the president so instead he just immediately ended the meeting.

300
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,540
 Really? That was a stop and a half. I'm pretty sure that tree got hit by lightning or something.

301
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,900
 I storm I think. That's the official story.

302
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:50,540
 Yeah, hit by lightning. What happened to the chairman? He was hit by lightning.

303
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,940
 Just very quickly I was just looking at the hobbies of the two presidents who didn't like golf to see

304
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,580
 what they did in their spare time. So one of them was Truman, a woman once wrote to President Truman

305
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,060
 asking what he did in his spare time and there was a reply from his spokesperson who said

306
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,140
 "The president has no hobbies and his official duties leave him little time for recreation.

307
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,140
 Most of his activities are reported in the daily newspapers where no doubt you're afraid of them."

308
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,420
 That's the end of Truman's no hobby. That's a really good reply isn't it? That's what you want.

309
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:27,260
 Busy making the country run, yeah. I don't want that at all. It's nippy though. It is a bit nippy but the

310
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,860
 other one is much better. So Jimmy Carter, my favorite president anyway, is into woodwork but really

311
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:39,820
 into woodwork. So he makes all this furniture and he sells it. So he's made loads of cradles. He made

312
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:45,340
 a full poster bed that he sold for a quarter of a million dollars. He made a cradle in 2007 that he

313
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:50,300
 sold for 320 thousand dollars. Now it is possible there's a slight inflation on these prices given

314
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,420
 that it's made by Jimmy Carter and the money goes to charity. I doubt it. But I think it's just good

315
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:01,580
 quality projects. I read about Lyndon B. Johnson apparently according to Forbes an article on

316
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:09,900
 that. His hobby was drunk driving around his property. Yeah he had a ranch and he liked to drink

317
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,020
 drive around there and especially he had an amphibious car which he would pretend that he was

318
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:23,820
 accidentally driving into a lake. He would do that with guests right. And then they'd be fine.

319
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:30,140
 Quiz question about Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter is the 39th president of the United States

320
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,060
 America. What first does he bring as a president and this is something to do with his personal life?

321
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:39,260
 First woodwork expert. That's probably I've definitely phrased this question. Was he the first to write

322
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:46,700
 a children's book? No. He was the first to put a bowling lane in the White House. No. Basically he's

323
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:53,100
 the first president to have been born in a hospital. 39th president. I love them were born in wood cabins

324
00:20:53,100 --> 00:21:06,460
 when they were all built by him. Okay it is time for fact number three and that is my fact. My fact

325
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:13,100
 is that when the poets Shelley and Byron went on a rider's retreat to Lake Geneva in 1816 the hotel

326
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:20,940
 opposite them hired out telescopes to their guests so that they could spy on them. It's so surreal.

327
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:26,780
 So this by the way was a very very famous trip that Shelley and Byron had made because they

328
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,740
 they were sat in the house one night and there were lots of storms that were going on for about

329
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:37,340
 three days solid and it's during one of those storms that Shelley's girlfriend at the time Mary

330
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:42,620
 and Byron and Shelley started coming up with ghost stories and scary stories horror stories and

331
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,500
 that's where Frankenstein was born. So the five guests there were three great writers and then two really

332
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,220
 tragic figures. One of whom was Claire Claremont who was Byron's Flues who he'd impregnated and he

333
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,420
 really wanted her to stop trying to get off with him and she followed him there and so he invited this

334
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:02,700
 other guy his doctor called Polidori to act as like a third wheel to make sure that Claire didn't get

335
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,820
 a chance to get Byron in a corner and snog him whatever and yeah Polidori had the most awful time

336
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,900
 with Byron employed us his doctor and they were asked to write these ghost stories on this night by

337
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,980
 and challenged him to write a ghost story and Polidori wrote this story and wrote the first ever vampire

338
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,540
 story in the English language and he just kind of forgot about it. He sent it to a friend when he

339
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:28,620
 got back to the UK and it got lost somewhere and then a few years later it got published in this monthly

340
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,980
 magazine just under the title of the vampire tale by Lord Byron and so Polidori has spent you know

341
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:39,100
 many years being so jealous of Byron and hating him resenting him and then he finds that this one

342
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,780
 story is written as published under Byron's name. I like that sort of as a ghost story that was

343
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:48,460
 accidentally ghost written. Yeah. Not really a ghost story because there's no ghost in it. Yeah,

344
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:54,540
 but yeah. Anyway, let's get back to this hotel. What's quite amazing about it is A, I didn't realize

345
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:00,220
 celebrity paparazzi things were going on back then. I think Byron is often credited as being a part of

346
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,780
 the birth of that whole session. Yeah, one of the first boop rumble as well. Yeah, he was basically

347
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:11,500
 the Anna Winter of the time. He was defining fashion purely by what he would write as reports of

348
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,180
 a sort of vanity therapy or a party. Yeah, exactly. Right. So they found not too long ago in the last

349
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:24,060
 couple of years the addition of Frankenstein that Mary Shelley signed for Byron. So she sent

350
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:28,780
 him a letter saying I'd love to hear if you think this is a good book. He never sent back a comment.

351
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,580
 And then he then wrote someone asked him about the book and he wrote his opinion to them in that and

352
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:39,900
 he said me thinks it's a wonderful work for a girl of 19. So he did like it but kind of patronizingly

353
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:45,580
 I don't know. Was it anyone who still sends it with me things? I know. I thought it was like it's George

354
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:54,380
 our binks. Oh, yeah. It's things. Wonderful. Oh, God, I know. She was pretty weird actually,

355
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,500
 Mary Shelley. What's she? Well, I think she did a couple of weird things. So Percy drowned

356
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:06,460
 in a shipwreck. After he died, she bought this Clifftop house in Bournemouth and this was in 1851

357
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,660
 and then she moved there with her children but she also moved the remains of her parents there.

358
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,180
 So her parents were buried in their King's Cross and she was just like, well, I'm moving. I guess

359
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,740
 I'll just bring my parents along. Oh, you mean as soon she dug up the graves? Yeah. She had the graves

360
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,500
 dug up and had them re-buried in Bournemouth. Isn't that strange? Yeah. Well, she also kept

361
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:30,060
 Percy Shelley's heart in her desk. So the rumor goes. I don't think we have any evidence of that.

362
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,980
 Okay, because I think that more modern historians would say they actually think it was Shelley's liver

363
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,660
 that they mistaken for a heart. I think the story was told by one of Shelley's friends was that when

364
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,140
 Shelley was being cremated, his friend dived into the fire and seized the heart. So it's probably

365
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,740
 possible that he would have accidentally seized the liver because they weren't very anatomically good

366
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,980
 then anyway and there's a big fire in the way. So I guess he just went for the first organ and he could

367
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,380
 get his hands on. Yeah, who knows. Byron had a coffin at the end of his dining table. They really

368
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:00,140
 kind of loved that kind of stuff. He used to get skulls and have them converted into drinking cups.

369
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,620
 Yeah, drinking cups. Yeah, drinking cups. In fact, he wanted Percy Shelley's skull as well. You jumped

370
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:11,660
 into the fire. Yeah. He accidentally brought his femur out. They were worried. I've got a straw.

371
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:20,140
 I talk about my favourite spice satellite and telescope. You've been listening to all this literature.

372
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,100
 All I know, if you've got more literature. No, no, no. The corona spice satellites of reconnaissance

373
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,940
 satellites, they were kind of made in the 60s and 70s and they were one of the first reconnaissance

374
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,100
 satellites we put up into space and they had cameras in them but they were normal code act film cameras.

375
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,100
 So when all the pictures had been taken, the satellite would jettison out a canister of film

376
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,060
 which would fall to earth and so it would come through the atmosphere and then a parachute would

377
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:44,460
 open so it would be crashing down and then a plane would fly alongside it and grab it out of the air.

378
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:51,260
 That is unbelievable. I know. What? What? Why? Yeah, why would you fly alongside it and not

379
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,420
 just wait for it to land? Well, it meant that it was safe of because you could go to risk of some

380
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:00,060
 or pick it up but there were there were examples of them not catching it in mid air and they landed

381
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,820
 like farmers land and stuff and they used to write the words top secret on it but they stopped doing

382
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:09,660
 that because everyone kept opening them. Have you ever seen the the capsules which the

383
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:15,020
 Cosmonauts came down in and then it would say in Russian person inside to be not be scared

384
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:20,460
 this is not an alien. It's a Cosmonauts car. It's amazing. It said that this is not an alien.

385
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,660
 It's something like that. It's like, yeah, it's like, do you not be alarmed? Then maybe a person inside

386
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:32,300
 please help people water and stuff. Do not lick balls. Yeah. Andrew Hunter Murray, who's away at the

387
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:38,700
 moment, he was telling me that NASA have a telescope on a plane so they fly the plane up and then they

388
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,500
 start observing through a telescope on the plane. Do you have this on the list? I only put my top one

389
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:51,740
 because I didn't think you'd listen to me for that long. I read an article from 1998 and it was about

390
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:58,380
 people buying telescopes in New York and 5,000 people had bought a telescope but because of the pollution

391
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:04,140
 you can't see any stars. And so they asked a lot of these people why have you bought telescopes and

392
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,500
 the most common answer was to spy on my neighbours. Really? Yeah. There was a survey done in Switzerland

393
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,380
 that asked people if they spied on their neighbours and 22% of people admitted that they did

394
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,180
 actively use equipment like binoculars or camera phones or through the spy holes in their door

395
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,300
 and they were asked why they spied on their neighbours and in Switzerland the most popular reason for

396
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:31,100
 spying was to check out a neighbour's plants. 28% of people... That feels like a swiss you for this.

397
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:38,540
 They did the same study in the UK and a third of people said they spied on their neighbours and in

398
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:44,940
 the UK the most commonly given reason is to check their all right. It's to check open brackets if

399
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:55,980
 they're a bit of close brackets. All right. Okay it is time for a final fact of the show and that is

400
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,980
 Chuzenski. My fact this week is that famous historical games of Go include the blood vomiting

401
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:09,100
 game, the ear reddening game, the famous killing game and the atomic bomb game. So this is about the

402
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:14,060
 game Go which is a very famous game comes from China originally. It's the oldest board game in the

403
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:19,260
 world that's still being played. That's not Pokemon Go then. Sorry no that's obviously one of the oldest

404
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:25,340
 games in the world still being played. It feels like to some of us but no and there have been games

405
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,180
 documented throughout history for hundreds of hundreds of years and there are these famous

406
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:34,220
 historical games. So what were they again? So the blood vomiting game. Okay so what happens in

407
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,900
 the blood vomiting game? It's a lot like it sounds and it was in 1835 and it was a game where there were

408
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,900
 two players one was beating the other and then the other had these four spectacular moves and

409
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,620
 the first move was a move that his school of Go had been planning for months and months. So he won

410
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:53,100
 that and then the next three moves were given to him by Ghosts. So he won those three as well because

411
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:59,260
 Ghosts came down and helped him out so he won that game. I read that sentence and I just sat back and

412
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,900
 just let it soak in. It's the most enjoyable little nugget I've read in a fact for a very long time.

413
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,980
 How is that not cheating? I don't understand how that's allowed. Because in Go it turns out that

414
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,220
 you are allowed help from other people you just need to pause the game. Just to jump forward very

415
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,900
 quickly I think we should stick on the blood vomiting game for a minute. But to jump forward to the

416
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:21,100
 ear reddening game that game took three months to play. Yeah. Took three months because each player was

417
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:28,060
 allowed a 24 hour period of thinking time in between each move and they took it. We're a spectator sport

418
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:34,700
 if you want a day ticket. Okay. And what they would do in that 24 hour periods is often the person

419
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,380
 who was playing would go back into there wherever they lived and they would have a group of students

420
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:45,900
 study the game up to the point it was at. And they would then decide on what potential new moves could

421
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,060
 be done. The next move. And just to finish off the blood vomiting game. Penny was still wondering

422
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:55,740
 about the name. So as this guy started to lose he keeled over, collapsed on the board and started

423
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,140
 coughing up blood and he was dead within a couple of months. I thought he probably had TB but it

424
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,780
 might have been just the pain of losing. And the ear reddening game that Dan mentioned is called

425
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:11,660
 that this is an 1846 it was a hot century for go but in 1846 it was a game that a doctor happened to be

426
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:15,900
 watching and everyone else who was watching it thought the one guy would lose and the doctor said no

427
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,700
 I think the other guy is going to lose and people said why? And he said because I saw his ears flush red

428
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,860
 when his opponent made a move and that means he's distressed. And then DT was right so that's the

429
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,260
 ear reddening game. And then sadly the famous killing game is just a really intense game. Wow so

430
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:36,060
 he glowed under stress as well. Like the space crest. That's amazing. Maybe that's how you stress out

431
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:42,780
 a bit of crest. You just beat it at go. Should we quickly explain what go is? Yes. Just very very simply

432
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:49,500
 it's a board game a bit like chess or drafts and each player has white or black pebbles and you put

433
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,540
 them on the board. It's quite complicated but the basic thing is you're trying to encircle your

434
00:30:54,540 --> 00:31:01,740
 opponent's pieces and get territory. Yeah encircle bits of territory and it's like one go at a time

435
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,020
 and it's incredibly simple the rules but very complex as James says to get good at it the strategy

436
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:12,460
 is completely complex. And the the famous thing recently is it's really hard for computers to play

437
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:18,620
 because there are so many different possible combinations of moves and one move that you do now

438
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,580
 in a hundred days time could be really important in ways that you haven't foreseen

439
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,540
 and so the computers can't work it out although recently I think they might have won that thing. Yeah

440
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:33,820
 I think this was a bit of a blow for the go community but AlphaGo which is made by Google's

441
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:39,020
 artificial intelligence arm and it's AlphaGo this thing that beat this Korean guy Lee Sedol

442
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,900
 and then so Lee Sedol is currently ranked fourth in the world and the person who's ranked first in

443
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:49,900
 the world is called KG and I'm really sorry that's mispronounced. He's 18 and he said when he saw

444
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,300
 AlphaGo being so good I don't want to play AlphaGo because I know that I'm better than AlphaGo

445
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,940
 I've watched as much as with Lee and AlphaGo is weaker than me and I don't want him stealing my moves

446
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,900
 so he's backed out of it so it's quite familiar from when I used to play chess as a child and my little

447
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,860
 brother started beating me and so I kept playing until I beat him once and said well now I'm the

448
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:15,500
 reigning champion I don't want to play anymore. But if you look at the rankings I think they're on

449
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,740
 official rankings but you can look at say the top 200 or whatever and they're all from either China,

450
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:29,420
 Japan or Korea apart from the world number two which is AlphaGo which is technically a British player.

451
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:34,540
 Woohoo! So we're number two in the world. That's very good. Yeah. Can I bring up another game that you

452
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:39,020
 mentioned in the headline facts? Yes sorry the atomic bomb game. The atomic bomb game. This is amazing.

453
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:44,300
 So they were in Hiroshima they were in the outer suburbs they were about five kilometers from

454
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:50,700
 where impact ground zero was through the bomb detonating. So they were mid-game and suddenly the bomb

455
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,900
 goes off and there was damage to their building people were injured around them. This is what's

456
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:02,460
 remarkable. They resumed play after a lunch break and then it was by the police coming around saying

457
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,740
 you need to go elsewhere and they just went further out to continue the game. Just on artificial

458
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,740
 intelligence and computers that we were talking about as James was saying goes quite a hard game to

459
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,180
 beat with a computer. There is a game that was specifically designed to be difficult for a computer

460
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:21,580
 beat by a guy called Omar Sayed who was inspired by watching Deep Blue defeat Casper off. So he

461
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,020
 invented this game called Arima which is it can be played on a chess board and it's basically a bit

462
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,420
 like chess but there are different pieces. There's like an elephant and a camel and a horse and

463
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:33,180
 dogs and cats. The idea is that it's supposed to be difficult for computers to play but easy for

464
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:38,460
 humans and because the computer can't use kind of like tree logic by looking up every single

465
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,820
 different combination and then working out the best one is by comparing them all. It's slightly

466
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:46,860
 intuitive but just like that a computer eventually won in 2013 they had an international competition

467
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,460
 every year there were three competitions there would be a human only competition a computer only

468
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:56,220
 competition and then the third one where computers versus humans and for ages computers always lost

469
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,980
 and then in 2015 they won. It would be good if they had Olympic boxing and then robot was and then

470
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:07,740
 the best Olympic boxer fought against the best robot was guy. Well they do robot football slash

471
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:15,020
 soccer now don't they and they do have the robots play a human team and Leven Skryra who is a very good

472
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:21,580
 friend of ours been on the show a few times. He reckons that by 2050 the robots will beat the human

473
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:29,020
 team. Yeah he does say that although they do look hilariously bad. It's like just putting a bunch of

474
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:35,500
 pigs into a football arena and say try and score they just have no interest in scoring they have

475
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,540
 no anything they're just running into walls. And pigs do play football sometimes don't they?

476
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:45,260
 I knew I knew I'd say something that would I would hope make no sense and James would come in saying

477
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,900
 actually. I think by law you're supposed to give them things to play with because they get bored

478
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,900
 and quite often they give them balls and they kind of like to nuzzle them around and I'm pretty

479
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,740
 sure I've seen a video of pigs playing football. Well maybe they're just looking them because I think

480
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:07,260
 it's good luck. Okay that's it that's all of our facts thank you so much for listening if you would
