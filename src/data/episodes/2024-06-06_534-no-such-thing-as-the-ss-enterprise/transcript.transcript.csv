00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of no such things a fish which was recorded when I was on my holiday"
00:00:06,00:00:10,So when I presume you have someone else in my place not just a cut out of me
00:00:10,00:00:16,"Nope, we had a little hand puppet of you and then did insulting northern accents the whole way through it was actually more enjoyable"
00:00:16,00:00:18,"No, that wasn't the case"
00:00:18,00:00:26,We had the brilliant Ali plumb on the fantastic film critic who I'm sure many of you will be very familiar with from Radio 1 and such
00:00:26,00:00:31,like he's known for interviewing the biggest celebs on the face of the earth and
00:00:31,00:00:33,Then he finally got to meet us
00:00:33,00:00:41,He did indeed and if you would like to learn anything more about Ali then the best thing to do is watch his interviews on Radio 1's
00:00:41,00:00:45,YouTube channel or BBC Radio 1's iPlayer
00:00:45,00:00:51,He also has a podcast called BBC radio on screen time where you can hear him talk about movies and you can of course follow
00:00:51,00:00:58,Him on social media as at Ali plumb and don't forget there is a bee at the end of his name is
00:00:58,00:01:02,PLU and be Ali plumb on all those social medias
00:01:02,00:01:07,I'm fairly certain I have to say that because I'm assuming Dan will pronounce his name correctly all the way through but you never know
00:01:07,00:01:13,Maybe that is gonna say Ali plumb. I'm very excited to find out actually that is the main reason
00:01:13,00:01:17,"I'm gonna listen to this podcast so do keep listening for that, but we do have another announcement as well"

00:02:02,00:02:08,Andrew Dan Shriver and the incredible Ali plumb. Okay up with the podcast on with the show
00:02:09,00:02:11,Hello
00:02:11,00:02:32,Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn
00:02:32,00:02:38,My name is Dan Shriver. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray Anna Tashinsky and Ali plumb and once again
00:02:38,00:02:44,We have gathered around the microphones with our fourth favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here
00:02:44,00:02:48,We go starting with fact number one and that is Ali
00:02:48,00:02:56,My fact this week is Jurassic World Dominion is the first film to have its parody movie be released before it itself was
00:02:56,00:02:58,released
00:02:59,00:03:05,"Lovely you with me. Yeah. Yeah, does that mean that Jurassic World Dominion is actually it becomes the parody"
00:03:05,00:03:10,"Like whatever comes out second becomes the spoof. Whoa, because I've seen it and it's quite funny in lots of ways"
00:03:10,00:03:12,I think arguably funnier than the parody
00:03:12,00:03:16,They came out of it and that's a sick burn because I love the director
00:03:16,00:03:23,"I will say yes that the bubble fails to give as many lolls as Jurassic World Dominion, but it is the bubble we're talking about"
00:03:23,00:03:25,This is a Netflix
00:03:25,00:03:27,Movie somehow came out in April 2022
00:03:27,00:03:34,Whereas Jurassic World Dominion came out in June that same year and the reason why it happened is essentially
00:03:34,00:03:41,Because of the pandemic and the idea of the bubble is that you have a group of actors in this meta comedy
00:03:41,00:03:46,Trying to make a movie except everyone keeps getting covet and they're inside this bubble
00:03:46,00:03:51,Hence the bubble and the movie they're making is the sixth in a franchise of a sci-fi
00:03:51,00:03:57,Sort of horror sort of adventure dinosaur movie and it's called cliff beast six
00:03:57,00:03:59,battle for everest
00:03:59,00:04:01,memories of a requiem
00:04:01,00:04:05,Needless to say and it's from judd apatow and it features the likes of
00:04:05,00:04:09,david kovni leslie man kate mckinnon pedra paskow and is it not good?
00:04:09,00:04:13,That's a great cast. I can only say that the first half hour is not good. There it is
00:04:13,00:04:20,There it is. I I am built to love everything judd apatow does so I did like it
00:04:20,00:04:25,"But I I can see arguably it's not his best. Well, that's the biggest slam you've ever given anything done"
00:04:25,00:04:28,"Yeah, that's that's a sick burn. Yeah"
00:04:28,00:04:33,"You should be the film critic. I know right take over. Yeah, I just find these weird"
00:04:33,00:04:38,Coronavirus glitches now that we can sort of ish find it funny. Yeah quite bizarre
00:04:38,00:04:44,"For example, billy eilish won an oscar for best original song for no time to die"
00:04:44,00:04:46,Before the film itself came out
00:04:46,00:04:52,Right. Yes because she was eligible to win for that year because the song was actually released as a single prior to it
00:04:52,00:04:59,"So it had to be in the year of the grammy's but she hadn't already she hadn't written the song and then they said, you know, that'd be an incredible name for a bond"
00:04:59,00:05:07,"That wasn't it was it she'd be contracted to correct a film. Okay. I don't know how it works. Um parody movies go back a long, long way"
00:05:07,00:05:14,"Oh, yeah, this is a got a beautiful history and the earliest that I could find and it certainly comes up at most lists as the opening one"
00:05:14,00:05:18,Was a movie that came out in 1905 called the little train robbery
00:05:18,00:05:25,Directed by edwin s porter and so it was a parody of a 1903 movie called the great train robbery
00:05:25,00:05:32,Which was also directed by edwin s porter. Nice. He parodied his own movie. Maybe it's easier to parody if you've got the inside track
00:05:32,00:05:36,"Yeah, and you're not going to really annoy anyone because you're the person you're annoying"
00:05:36,00:05:40,But actually it says it's a parody. I would argue that he was almost making a kid's version
00:05:40,00:05:44,"Well, it's it's the same film scene for scene except starring children. Yeah"
00:05:44,00:05:50,"It's bugsy Malone, right? I think it sounds really I think more. Have you not watched it? No, haven't is it good?"
00:05:50,00:05:52,"It's only 12 minutes, mate"
00:05:52,00:05:56,I was watching the first half hour of the bubble. I did not have time
00:05:56,00:06:02,"It is. I mean, is it good? It's made in 1905. So you've got to take it for his time, haven't you?"
00:06:02,00:06:08,"I looked at the interviews on imdb and someone's like three stars. No, it's not quite his best work as a parody"
00:06:08,00:06:12,I'm on buddy. Where are the zayk invented parodies in film?
00:06:12,00:06:18,"He um, sorry the director of the great and little train robberies changed his name because he was born edward"
00:06:18,00:06:24,"And he changed his name to edwin stanton after the secretary of war under Abraham Lincoln, which I think is niche anyway"
00:06:24,00:06:30,"Hello, the ladies love it. I'm sort of 40 years later as well. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely"
00:06:30,00:06:36,I did find out was he trying to pass himself off? He might have seen my earlier work in the civil war
00:06:37,00:06:40,One of mine. What are the early funny ones?
00:06:40,00:06:44,"But yeah, it's very it's very good and they hold up the train at the end as they do in the"
00:06:44,00:06:51,"1903 great train robbery, but in the kids version they just get sweets and sort of toys off them"
00:06:51,00:06:57,I love it. By the way on the earliest incarnation of a certain kind of movie we're talking about early parodies in
00:06:57,00:07:02,1900 so that's even before the great train robbery and the little train robbery
00:07:02,00:07:06,The first appearance of Sherlock Holmes as a character on screen
00:07:06,00:07:11,Was in a very short short seriously short short that came out again at the turn of century
00:07:11,00:07:17,And that was a parody of the concept of Sherlock Holmes knowing everything because it was one of the first trick
00:07:17,00:07:21,Cinema shorts where it was cuts in and out things disappearing
00:07:21,00:07:25,And it was Sherlock being baffled and that's why it's called Sherlock Holmes baffled
00:07:25,00:07:30,And that's the first time anyone ever saw Sherlock Holmes and as a result
00:07:30,00:07:36,His popularity has meant that he's been the most seen character almost inarguably across the history of cinema and television
00:07:36,00:07:42,"Wow, that's cool because he's there at the very beginning. Yeah, everyone who's ever seen a screen"
00:07:42,00:07:46,Understands. We've seen a version of Sherlock Holmes on screen at some point or another. That's extraordinary. That's very cool
00:07:46,00:07:52,"I just find all this stuff fascinating and again, it's only 30 seconds. So maybe it'll be on a tiktok soon. Yeah, right"
00:07:52,00:07:55,I won't find the time. I'm sorry. I'm just so busy. So was this was Jurassic World?
00:07:55,00:07:57,"Wait, what was it called the real serious?"
00:07:57,00:08:03,Jurassic World Dominion Jurassic World Dominion and I do want to kick the tires of this fact a little bit because I'm aware that there are more
00:08:03,00:08:08,"Direct parodies in the universe, right? So hot shots is definitely a parody of top gun"
00:08:08,00:08:11,"Yes, there's loads of other stuff going on in there, but you can see the direct parallel"
00:08:11,00:08:16,"Here when it comes to the bubble and Jurassic World Dominion, it's the sort of bubbliness"
00:08:16,00:08:22,This coronavirus. Mm-hmm. That's the parody and the parody film seems to be within the film the bubble
00:08:22,00:08:24,You've got it. So it's sort of double meta
00:08:25,00:08:30,"And this reminds me of one of my favorite jokes. I think in any movie, which is in hot shorts part. Uh, beautiful movie"
00:08:30,00:08:34,Now in this film charlie sheen and martin sheen both appear
00:08:34,00:08:41,And referencing each other's vietnam war movies. They're writing in their own little diaries
00:08:41,00:08:43,Excerpts from each other's movies
00:08:43,00:08:49,They both then as the boats that they're on pass each other in a river stand up and say father to son
00:08:49,00:08:52,I loved you in wall street
00:08:53,00:08:55,"Okay, think about that. Are they"
00:08:55,00:09:02,For half a second and your brain explodes because they were both in wall street in the universe of hot shots part
00:09:02,00:09:07,Dirt they've both seen each other's film that they were both themselves in and their father and son and they've both seen the other
00:09:07,00:09:09,Vietnam
00:09:09,00:09:15,"Wow, I guess in a darkened movie cinema you can tell who the critics are in the crowd"
00:09:15,00:09:20,"You just hear a brain blow. No, you just hear a load of scribbling as they write down the joke"
00:09:21,00:09:25,"Let's say you can tell when it's funny. No one's laughing. Yeah, so we said that it was delayed"
00:09:25,00:09:32,I assume it was delayed. Maybe you did say that. Yes the film coming the series film was delayed Jurassic world dominion was delayed
00:09:32,00:09:34,It's also just got much more CGI at a much higher level
00:09:34,00:09:39,Although ironically it was ilm industrial light and magic who did the dinosaur
00:09:39,00:09:46,"Visual effects for both movies. So, you know, why not do both just if they both ask you then just go ahead"
00:09:46,00:09:50,"Yeah, you think there would be a contractual thing that you put you'd say you're not allowed to work on any other dino stuff"
00:09:50,00:09:56,"Or one that's directly taking the mick out of us. Yeah. Yeah. Um, can I tell you about the another dinosaur?"
00:09:56,00:10:00,This is not a parody. This is a very cool thing. So this was a film that's out in 1993
00:10:00,00:10:06,"And it is a famous dinosaur film from 1993 that was released before Jurassic Park, right? Okay"
00:10:06,00:10:09,So Jurassic Park was the second
00:10:09,00:10:12,Dino movie in 1993. The first one was Carnosaur
00:10:12,00:10:16,"Yes, go on and it was about it was about a doctor"
00:10:17,00:10:20,It was about this mad scientist planning to exterminate the human race
00:10:20,00:10:26,"And replace humans with genetically engineered dinosaurs much better plot arguably. Um, wow"
00:10:26,00:10:30,Roger Ebert is a famous film critic. He named it the worst film of 1993
00:10:30,00:10:36,"And it was but the thing is it wasn't a parody of Jurassic Park because it was it was also based on a book, right?"
00:10:36,00:10:42,"There's a book called Carnosaur by a writer called John Brosnan, which was written in 1984 before Michael Crichton wrote the book of Jurassic Park"
00:10:42,00:10:46,"However, the film was only green lit when they heard the Jurassic Park was being made"
00:10:47,00:10:50,"So they were kind of looking around. Oh, I wonder if we have some other dinosaur content that we can get out"
00:10:50,00:10:52,But this is the crazy thing
00:10:52,00:10:56,Diane Ladd the actor was cast as the evil protagonist
00:10:56,00:10:59,She is the mother of Laura Dern
00:10:59,00:11:04,Oh in real life who's in in real life who's in Jurassic Park
00:11:04,00:11:10,So that was casting coup to say let's get your star's mum to be in art
00:11:10,00:11:15,And then there's that scene in Dominion where they're passing each other in a boat
00:11:16,00:11:20,There are so many dino parodies though. It seemed to have spawned so many
00:11:20,00:11:26,Like Jurassic Park is such a cultural phenomenon and it's so easy like a Bond movie to go right. I get it
00:11:26,00:11:30,Welcome to Jurassic Park. There's an old man with a cane. Mr. DNA all this stuff
00:11:30,00:11:34,Here are all real names a real dinosaur part
00:11:34,00:11:37,The Jurassic dead
00:11:37,00:11:43,Because they've come back from the dead because one of those evil scientists has managed to that's like undead. It should be
00:11:43,00:11:46,"Yeah, but that sounds good. That does sound good. Well, it sounds good"
00:11:46,00:11:49,The Jurassic games
00:11:49,00:11:51,It's like the hunger games
00:11:51,00:11:53,But with dinosaurs. I watch that. Yeah
00:11:53,00:12:00,"And this is my favorite and it knows that it's dumb, but it's called the velocirpasta"
00:12:00,00:12:05,As in it's a vicar
00:12:05,00:12:10,Brilliant who has the ability to turn into a velociraptor and kill evil doers
00:12:11,00:12:16,"When he can't control his anger sort of thing, but the honey tagline is godlike"
00:12:16,00:12:19,man of the claw
00:12:19,00:12:21,Hold on
00:12:21,00:12:24,Give me a minute. Wait. He's not done. He's not done. He's not done. Sorry
00:12:24,00:12:28,"Man of the cloth, correct"
00:12:28,00:12:31,Man of the claw
00:12:31,00:12:36,You can't interrupt people mid-joke. I would I would put that on Ali for stopping that long mid-joke
00:12:39,00:12:46,And man of the cloth is that's great. How is it? It's well in cloth. They just I think Ali made pretty clear a spell
00:12:46,00:12:53,But it's it's a it's was a fake trailer that you'd see on youtube
00:12:53,00:12:56,"And then someone said, you know, this is actually pretty good fun and they went"
00:12:56,00:12:58,"Well, let's get like 10 grand and make a movie out of it"
00:12:58,00:13:04,So let's not pretend like the velocirpasta is trying to be the next Jurassic park. It knows it's dumb
00:13:04,00:13:09,Do you as part of your job which is in film criticism have to watch all of these?
00:13:10,00:13:14,"No, I think there needs to be an audience desire for my thoughts on"
00:13:14,00:13:19,"Yeah, the velocirpasta and if there isn't then I don't feel the obligation. I bet there will be now"
00:13:19,00:13:26,"I just sound so good. Um, dan have you heard of the film caveman from 1981 and there's a very specific reason i'm asking dan this"
00:13:26,00:13:32,"Yeah, I haven't seen it ringo star. It stars ringo star as a caveman who lives one zillion bc"
00:13:32,00:13:36,And they also meet an abominable snowman at some point in the movie
00:13:36,00:13:44,"So I just thought this is the most dan film. Dan, why haven't you seen it? I thought it sounds too much like a glitch in the universe"
00:13:44,00:13:49,"Like I'd proven this was all fake. It's the Truman show. Yeah, no one would have made this film unless you were alive"
00:13:49,00:13:54,I can't exist. I think the only thing it produced was ringo star second marriage and that's about the only to Barbara bark
00:13:54,00:13:58,"That's right. So who is a bond girl? Well, she was also the female lead in"
00:13:58,00:14:01,Caveman 1981
00:14:02,00:14:05,Which is she proud or if I wonder don't know who could say probably ringo
00:14:05,00:14:12,By the way speaking of bond obviously bond is such a huge franchise news just in that it can inspire its own
00:14:12,00:14:16,Franchise its own genre of bond parodies and we have to at least acknowledge them
00:14:16,00:14:19,But are you guys aware of the film called okay Connery?
00:14:19,00:14:27,It's also called operation kid brother. Yes. So good and what happened here is that Sean Connery's brother
00:14:28,00:14:30,Neil got into the press
00:14:30,00:14:34,For and I think it was like the mirror or something for being fired from his job
00:14:34,00:14:38,Because he lost his tools. This was a little bit of news bonds brother loses tools
00:14:38,00:14:43,"Loses job or the sort of thing and someone said a bit like a joke. Well, he does look a bit like Sean"
00:14:43,00:14:46,Let's get him into sort of like euro cheapo
00:14:46,00:14:53,Bond knockoff and it got called okay Connery because when they were giving him his first notes for the audition they kept going
00:14:53,00:14:55,okay Connery
00:14:55,00:14:59,"Okay Connery anyway, so that became the movie and what I love about it is that it is dreadful"
00:14:59,00:15:03,But also it features bond stars that came back
00:15:03,00:15:07,To appear in a bond spoof right which happens quite a lot
00:15:07,00:15:11,Johnny English has two in the form of Rosamund Pike and also Olga Kirilenko
00:15:11,00:15:14,And they have said and it was I think Lewis
00:15:14,00:15:21,Maxwell that she got paid more for okay Connery than she ever did for her work as money penny
00:15:21,00:15:28,"On the bonds now. I think she was sort of saying it as a joke, but you have to watch okay Connery because he was"
00:15:28,00:15:32,So sorry Neil so bad at it. Right an American
00:15:32,00:15:39,Voice actor had to come in and dub his lines. So half the reason why you hired him just got removed last minute
00:15:39,00:15:46,"You must look it up. So someone doing an impression of Sean Connery. Oh, not even it's just an American voice"
00:15:46,00:15:49,"Oh, right. Okay. They didn't ask him to pretend to be Sean Conner"
00:15:50,00:15:54,Do you like when the when the relatives of the main stars get brought in for these kind of things?
00:15:54,00:15:57,You'll know this ali. I'm pulling this out the top of my head here
00:15:57,00:16:03,But toy story the merchandise doys the merchant the merchandise the merchandise the the toys
00:16:03,00:16:05,I think it's tom hanks's brother
00:16:05,00:16:11,Who does the voice over for the toys themselves not tom hanks's brother who had a handkerchief company?
00:16:11,00:16:14,That's his son
00:16:15,00:16:19,Paul Hanks family like Paul tommy this cottage industry around different people
00:16:19,00:16:23,"Achieve he's not entirely insane, but it is very bizarre"
00:16:23,00:16:28,"There's a lot of nepotism in the film industry like anywhere else, isn't there actually speaking of bond spoofs"

00:16:32,00:16:36,It was an actor called
00:16:36,00:16:38,Ted nude gent
00:16:38,00:16:44,"But he I'm so confused. So this was a cat called Ted nude gent. Oh, right. Okay. Who played mr. Bigglesworth?"
00:16:44,00:16:46,"Okay, funny name very well. I'm sure"
00:16:46,00:16:48,I'm nailed it very talented actor
00:16:48,00:16:53,But then he's got two nephews dinner how talented they are they're called hairless potter and skin diana jones
00:16:53,00:16:58,"And they are also actors now, but you do have to wonder is that pure talent or is that?"
00:16:58,00:17:04,You know the nepotistic connections that have got you there skin diana jones is an absolutely rank name. I'm sorry
00:17:04,00:17:07,"It's a brilliant pun, but it's horrible. Is it one of those little hairless?"
00:17:07,00:17:10,Like a tiny me
00:17:10,00:17:18,"It's not healthy. I have a bunch of terrible, but also funny bond parody film titles. Oh, great. These are all quote unquote real"
00:17:18,00:17:25,Never say never mind the swedish bikini team dr. Goldfoot and the bikini machine

00:17:31,00:17:37,That's arguably just a good title. It is a good title. Yeah. Yeah. All the others sound like they're made by very early ai
00:17:38,00:17:40,Yeah
00:17:40,00:17:42,That hasn't quite got it
00:17:42,00:17:55,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is andy. My fact is that britain is home to the planet's largest manhole cover"
00:17:55,00:17:59,Strong brag from britain. Yeah
00:17:59,00:18:02,It's enormous. Wow
00:18:02,00:18:04,Don't make it so sexy so quickly
00:18:04,00:18:07,How big a man can get into this hole?
00:18:07,00:18:09,Any man
00:18:09,00:18:14,So this is it's a 1200 ton concrete lid
00:18:14,00:18:18,It's huge that is going and at the moment it is used for access
00:18:18,00:18:23,"By workers, so it is technically a manhole and it's round. So, you know, yeah"
00:18:23,00:18:27,It's a little as in how do you get through the concrete? How do you lift it and what's underneath it?
00:18:27,00:18:31,It is going to be closed and then I believe the plan is that it's not going to be lifted up again
00:18:31,00:18:35,"So, you know, it's playing a bit fast and loose with what a manhole cover is"
00:18:35,00:18:37,It's experimenting with the form
00:18:37,00:18:41,And this is part of a thing an amazing thing if you haven't heard of it
00:18:41,00:18:47,"And if you're overseas, you won't have done um called the tens tideway tunnel is the biggest infrastructure project in europe"
00:18:47,00:18:51,It's happening right now. Some of you aren't overseas and they also don't feel bad
00:18:51,00:18:57,It's a new thing that's happening in london. It's going to be called the super sewer
00:18:57,00:19:03,And it is a ginormous pipe that is going to run under everyone's looking at me like this is boring
00:19:03,00:19:05,"Well, no, I feel like you're being paid by them at this point"
00:19:05,00:19:08,You're talking like trump all of a sudden
00:19:08,00:19:14,It is ginormous. It is huge. Can you give us some numbers trump? Can you give us anything that's true?
00:19:14,00:19:22,"It's going to be 16 miles long, right? And the the basically the problem in london is it's got this amazing sewage system for the 1860s, right?"
00:19:22,00:19:24,unfortunately
00:19:24,00:19:27,Time has moved on and london's population is now way bigger than it was then
00:19:27,00:19:34,So you get all of this sewage that if it rains heavily the sewage system overflows because rainwater and sewage water
00:19:34,00:19:36,They go to the same place that was a clever thing to do at the time
00:19:36,00:19:40,But these days it doesn't work anymore and you get lots and lots and lots of
00:19:40,00:19:43,Horrible sewagey water in the river
00:19:43,00:19:47,problem we say it overflows also every single sewage company in the country
00:19:47,00:19:53,Deliberately dumps billions and billions of gallons of it into the rivers just again if you're overseas
00:19:54,00:19:59,You might not know let's not act like it's an accident. Please go on andy. It's not it's not an evil scheme
00:19:59,00:20:03,But it is a bad it's a bad system. It hasn't been updated anyway
00:20:03,00:20:07,The super sewer is essentially as the project manager Ryan Moore said a massive toilet
00:20:07,00:20:09,It will be able to take a huge amount of overflow
00:20:09,00:20:13,So it's going to make things a lot better and it has this enormous manhole cover on it
00:20:13,00:20:18,Enormous it's a matter and i'm just so excited. Can I just tell you one more thing before we talk about manhole covers?
00:20:18,00:20:20,Is that how big it is? It's yes it is
00:20:22,00:20:24,"It's so huge, right?"
00:20:24,00:20:30,Please withhold your what are you compensating for emails
00:20:30,00:20:34,It's it's funny isn't it because i've been on a quest to find the most boring thing
00:20:34,00:20:37,Interesting and I think now I might have got there
00:20:37,00:20:42,Ali actually checked his watch a second ago. This is somebody who's been dying to come on our show
00:20:42,00:20:45,He's been listening to us for 10 years
00:20:45,00:20:50,"Um, right. So the the huge falling down pipes where the the overflow water is going to smash down"
00:20:51,00:20:54,They had to be designed especially because if you just let the water pour into it
00:20:54,00:20:57,It would smash into the bottom and erode the base of the thing
00:20:57,00:21:02,So it has to be kind of channeled around these huge great massive cathedral pipes
00:21:02,00:21:07,"Um, go down to the spiral put in a vortex bubbles put in not like an awesome like, uh"
00:21:07,00:21:11,Water slide it will be the most disgusting water slide you could possibly imagine
00:21:11,00:21:17,"Please field trip. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, and it's all about to be sealed off humans won't go in for the next 10 years"
00:21:17,00:21:21,"Because if you want that ride get there now. Absolutely. Yeah, and it's opening"
00:21:21,00:21:25,"I think it'll be fully open next year, but basically it's just an amazing. It's an amazing thing"
00:21:25,00:21:27,I found out that sewage moves about walking pace
00:21:27,00:21:32,"Wow, isn't that a nice idea? That is nice. So the way it's um"
00:21:32,00:21:34,Hang on is it?
00:21:34,00:21:38,It's a night. It's nice to know if I ever dropped into a sewer that you could escape it
00:21:38,00:21:43,You could escape it and it's not going to be gush and pass you that's a fear I have magic falling down a manhole like lava
00:21:43,00:21:47,"Yeah, like lava moves quite slowly when it's flowing across ground very similar"
00:21:47,00:21:50,"Well, I think this is average, but basically the way it works is largely by gravity"
00:21:50,00:21:54,"So in fact, it really reminds me of a log flume. This is certainly in London"
00:21:54,00:21:56,In such a joke here. Yeah
00:21:56,00:22:02,Let's take a photo. London's most real log flume
00:22:02,00:22:06,I don't want this on my keychain actually
00:22:09,00:22:14,It um it saunters at walking pace down because it gradually slopes downwards the sewerage system
00:22:14,00:22:18,And then once it's got as low as it can go lower than anyone wants to dig
00:22:18,00:22:23,Then it's pumped up again like on a log flume. So you get on the ramp and it's tickly tick tick tick tick
00:22:23,00:22:25,You get up to the top and then it flows down again
00:22:25,00:22:31,"That's interesting. Yeah, very fun for the little bits of bits poo. Yeah, what a sentence"
00:22:31,00:22:35,Um manhole covers
00:22:35,00:22:39,There's a thing that I had never heard about before which is that they were one of the most
00:22:39,00:22:44,notorious questions that you would get asked if you were doing an interview for Microsoft
00:22:44,00:22:51,"Yeah, so the question you'd be sitting in your interview with Microsoft and they would say why are manhole covers round?"
00:22:51,00:22:53,that's the question and you have to give an answer and
00:22:53,00:23:00,It's part of these lateral thinking questions that these huge corporations have become famous for so
00:23:01,00:23:07,People around the world have submitted the questions that they were asked from Microsoft a summer intern candidate was asked
00:23:07,00:23:12,Devise a way to make sure there is always milk in my fridge. I'd like that big fridge
00:23:12,00:23:16,Let's let's sort of have a field in there. Maybe some cows. Yeah
00:23:16,00:23:21,Cow in the fridge. Oh just let read let put a sorry just put a label saying fridge on the cow
00:23:21,00:23:24,"He's got it. No, you can't make something"
00:23:24,00:23:27,Call your cow fridge your cow. It's called fridge
00:23:27,00:23:30,She won't mind. She won't there you go
00:23:30,00:23:33,Doesn't like if I put a label on you saying genius Andy does that make you a genius?
00:23:33,00:23:38,If I'm labeled that by you I'm it's not for me to say but it's not for my fridge to say whether it's a fridge or not
00:23:38,00:23:43,I'm saying that's like if I give that answer you've got the job. You've got the job. You've got the job. You've got the job
00:23:43,00:23:48,You're now running Microsoft. Yeah. Yeah. Gaze is gonna resign. We'll do a press conference later today. We're gonna say we found the better answer
00:23:48,00:23:53,"Yeah, there's another one. Okay. Here we go. The infamous clock hands question"
00:23:53,00:23:56,This is what a software development engineer candidate was asked
00:23:57,00:24:02,How many times do the hour and minute hands of a clock overlap in a 24-hour period?
00:24:02,00:24:07,Rename the clock
00:24:07,00:24:13,"If it's a stopped clock, they won't overlap at all. I karate kicked my way out of the room"
00:24:13,00:24:20,"Throw the clock on the ground. Yeah, peace out right out on fridge the cow"
00:24:20,00:24:26,"We're buying apple. Yeah, great. Our watches are all digital at Microsoft"
00:24:26,00:24:28,Nice
00:24:28,00:24:30,Who keeps learning this guy back in the room?
00:24:30,00:24:34,I'm gonna say interviews always go well when the interviewee is going
00:24:34,00:24:43,"Oh my god, this is gonna be so annoying for you guys. I haven't got the action"
00:24:43,00:24:47,Because because most of them I I forgot to notice that that had an actual answer
00:24:47,00:24:51,"You could give because most of these are hypotheticals, you know, how do you fill the milk in my fridge?"
00:24:51,00:24:56,"By the way on the round manhole thing. Yeah, there's loads of answers to it. Yeah, that's yeah"
00:24:56,00:25:00,"If you were giving genuine answers, there's no one which is so obvious. You go. Oh, yeah"
00:25:00,00:25:05,Is that you there's that noise again? You take it off and you can just roll it easier. Yeah
00:25:05,00:25:10,"If you need to move it, that's easier to move than a square one. You go well, obviously"
00:25:10,00:25:13,"Also, it can't fall in because if you have a little rim"
00:25:13,00:25:18,The edge means it can't go in it just kind of stays there like there are loads of reasons
00:25:18,00:25:23,"But if someone asked you that question point blank and you're not expecting it, you just go, uh, uh, because they're round"
00:25:23,00:25:27,Do you know how people steal manhole covers?
00:25:27,00:25:31,Because there used to be a thing of they're very valuable for scrap the big heavy things the made of metal
00:25:31,00:25:36,"Yeah, the scrap metal valuable. Um, this is so clever. There are some"
00:25:36,00:25:38,theft vans
00:25:38,00:25:40,"Right, theft vans"
00:25:40,00:25:44,"Scrap stealer vans, which have how are they? How do they do it?"
00:25:45,00:25:50,"Well, they oh, they park over it. They have their own manhole in the bottom of their van"
00:25:50,00:25:55,And then they pick it up and replace it with that's got it. It's not that clever. I've got it. I've got it magnets
00:25:55,00:26:00,"Really big magnet. All right, we've already had the answer"
00:26:00,00:26:06,"Oh, I see. I've not got this. You're hanging around outside Microsoft HQ. I've thought I've counted"
00:26:06,00:26:08,I've waited a whole day and I counted the number of times the hands
00:26:11,00:26:15,"No, that is okay. That is interesting. So if you see at van parks, it's probably stealing a manhole cover"
00:26:15,00:26:22,The client said the most I just think the most incredible thing about manhole cover. So I didn't know is that they're always exploding
00:26:22,00:26:29,"In new york a manhole cover explodes every day explodes off its manhole into the air. Oh, really?"
00:26:29,00:26:34,"Yes, every single day on average. How many deaths do we get some deaths? Yeah, really not?"
00:26:34,00:26:38,I think the last one was 2008 but a lot of injuries and it's especially in
00:26:39,00:26:44,January and February and it seems to be this combination of old wiring and then there's rain and snow melt and then
00:26:44,00:26:51,Salt spread on the roads to stop ice gets in and that's all corrosive and electrical and it creates this massive explosion
00:26:51,00:26:53,So like there was a guy sitting in a parked car
00:26:53,00:26:58,Recently who just his car he had an explosion and his car lifted off the ground
00:26:58,00:27:02,And then it shot back onto the ground and he legged it and then watched it explode
00:27:02,00:27:07,That would be just the comeuppance for somebody trying to steal a manhole cover. They go right. We've nearly we've nearly got it
00:27:09,00:27:11,Okay
00:27:11,00:27:18,There's time for fact number three and that is
00:27:18,00:27:25,Anna my fact is that a spaceman was originally a journalist paid according to how much space their writing took up
00:27:25,00:27:30,"Brilliant so good. Yeah, I just think I came across this researching about a couple of weeks ago"
00:27:30,00:27:34,And I was just looking in the oed for something and I saw spaceman clicked on spaceman
00:27:34,00:27:39,And actually the first definition of it is from 1892 and it is a journalist
00:27:39,00:27:44,"Well, as as I said, they got paid in those days according to how long their articles were how much space they took up"
00:27:44,00:27:49,And the meaning to mean someone from outer space or someone who goes into outer space
00:27:49,00:27:53,Didn't rock up till 1932 right 40 years later
00:27:53,00:27:57,This is like the classic fact of batman existed before batman existed. What does that mean?
00:27:57,00:28:01,i.e a batman is somebody who would help like a an officer in an army
00:28:01,00:28:02,Yeah
00:28:02,00:28:07,And then later we have the understanding of what a batman is or a valet. So is batman a parody?
00:28:08,00:28:13,"That's right. Yes, correct. He was a man who really took his job much too seriously"
00:28:13,00:28:18,"And then ended up dressing up as a bat. Yeah, and then his parents died and then insert more jokes here"
00:28:18,00:28:20,"I don't know, but it's not a pun. It's not a direct. It's not a pun at all"
00:28:20,00:28:27,"But if batman if batman is the valet, who's the boss? Oh my god, that's right. Hold on isn't batman's batman"
00:28:27,00:28:29,"What's his name? Pennyworth. Oh, no the"
00:28:29,00:28:33,"So pennyworth is batman's batman. No, who's the old guy who's alfred?"
00:28:33,00:28:39,Alfred Pennyworth. Alfred. Oh Alfred. Sorry. Alfred Pennyworth. It's this thing on. Who calls Alfred by his surname?
00:28:39,00:28:45,Even batman has never done that. The guy who watched the tv show that's based on a kiddie knot the
00:28:45,00:28:52,Use of Alfred Pennyworth called Pennyworth. I'm gonna leave. Didn't know that. There's a tv series about the butler. Correct. That sounds boring
00:28:52,00:28:58,"It's no manhole covers. I'll give you that. Oh, sorry. What a great point. Why am I so nice?"
00:28:59,00:29:06,Master wine that guy. Yes. He's got his own tv series. Were you doing Michael K? Master wine. I was doing the impression of master wine
00:29:06,00:29:10,I'm actually my I'm actually Michael Cain's brother
00:29:10,00:29:17,Roger Cain I've had so many series. Do the blow the doors offline
00:29:17,00:29:21,I'm only supposed to blow the bloody master wine
00:29:21,00:29:25,The bloody doors
00:29:25,00:29:28,Dreadful cold you've got Michael
00:29:29,00:29:31,Anyway
00:29:31,00:29:39,The gilded age very brief period of time the gilded age 1870s to 1890s in the u.s. And that's where journalism
00:29:39,00:29:42,I think was undergoing a little bit of a revolution. I think newspapers had finally
00:29:42,00:29:47,stopped increasing sales and they were trying to give journalism a boost in various ways
00:29:47,00:29:56,"And yeah, people would get paid by length and people would get furious because also the idea of an editor was coming in as well"
00:29:56,00:29:59,And I read a rant actually by a journalist at the time
00:29:59,00:30:03,Who was saying that editors are the worst obviously because they hack away at your
00:30:03,00:30:04,salary
00:30:04,00:30:10,So you've written 17 000 words of tribe in the hope of getting paid 30 quid or whatever
00:30:10,00:30:14,"Um, and yeah, people used to get furious one writer saying many a time"
00:30:14,00:30:23,Have I had my financial prospects of a big bill grow smaller and smaller as that inexorable blue pencil went on its avalanche like mission of extermination
00:30:23,00:30:28,"Yes, I think we can see why your writing is cut down sometimes sir. You're the quiesciosity is noted"
00:30:28,00:30:30,I've got a list of uh
00:30:30,00:30:34,Old-fashioned terms that were used in the olden days great
00:30:34,00:30:40,"Which sound a little bit naughty, but they fit in with what you're saying. Do you know and this is relatively famous?"
00:30:40,00:30:43,"What a dog's dick is? Yeah, I certainly do"
00:30:43,00:30:48,A dog's dick or a dog's cock or a screamer
00:30:48,00:30:51,Or a shriek. I normally say the word screamer
00:30:51,00:30:54,It's one of those big exclamation points at the end of a headline
00:30:54,00:30:58,"Lovely, there are other words like fudge box. Is that to"
00:30:58,00:31:00,mess with the facts that is
00:31:00,00:31:05,A small area you kept free the sort of fudge box that you could sneak in just at the last minute
00:31:05,00:31:09,"Oh, right. So when people literally said the phrase stop the press"
00:31:09,00:31:15,They'd use that fudge box and then shove it in and then you could have things in after the deadline that could be fudged
00:31:15,00:31:20,"Like how you always think for the ivy restaurants fully booked, but they've always got a couple of tables on reserve in case"
00:31:20,00:31:25,"Very relatable stuff there, and am I right guys if I had"
00:31:25,00:31:28,A nickel for every time
00:31:28,00:31:31,"Well, that's that's the thing the sort of empty stuff being filled in later"
00:31:31,00:31:37,"I didn't really realize the precursor to newspapers is basically the sub-stack model, which is newsletters"
00:31:37,00:31:38,so
00:31:38,00:31:43,"Before papers he would subscribe to newsletter, which I really like"
00:31:43,00:31:48,"And it would be delivered personally to you. Yes, it would and it was it was handwritten"
00:31:48,00:31:51,You would get a handwritten letter rounding up interesting events
00:31:51,00:31:57,"Basically like news as gossip in a way, but there were hundreds of clerks who would write these out and sometimes in your"
00:31:57,00:32:00,newsletter the handwriting would change halfway through
00:32:00,00:32:02,Because there'd been a shift change or something
00:32:02,00:32:08,And they they were formatted like letters some of them and they started with the foreign news at the end with
00:32:08,00:32:12,You know local or more recent news. That's amazing. So I mean circulation can't have been very much
00:32:12,00:32:14,I wonder how many letters they describe
00:32:14,00:32:18,And you might share a subscription with your neighbor because they were really expensive. So you might club up
00:32:18,00:32:20,"You know, yeah"
00:32:20,00:32:27,And other newspapers were limited by official licensing laws. The government restricted newspapers very heavily until the late 17th century
00:32:27,00:32:29,"So this was a workaround, right"
00:32:29,00:32:32,There's another term just jumping back to Ali's terms
00:32:32,00:32:36,"called yellow journalism, which was back in the 1890s as well"
00:32:36,00:32:41,And this was and it's kind of almost the start of where newspapers started
00:32:41,00:32:49,Sensationalizing things and exaggerating headlines and bending fact into what it's not for the sake of getting newspapers sold
00:32:49,00:32:54,And yellow journalism was named after a comic book that used to appear in one of the newspapers in America
00:32:54,00:32:59,Where the character was called the yellow kid and he was he was a bold headed kid
00:32:59,00:33:02,His his head had been shaved because of lice
00:33:02,00:33:06,He wore a long jumper that was yellow and he would always have a slogan on it
00:33:06,00:33:12,which would parody as it were the big billboard advertisements that you would get for products and
00:33:12,00:33:16,Because they did that and he would often parody news of the day and so on in the comic strip
00:33:16,00:33:21,That became the go-to term for what these big people like william randolph hurris were doing
00:33:21,00:33:25,Where they were trying desperately to sell their version of the newspaper because when back in the day
00:33:25,00:33:27,You would go to a newspaper stand particularly
00:33:27,00:33:30,"That's almost a famous image in america, right where it's read all about it read all about"
00:33:31,00:33:35,And so they'd be yelling the headlines you go well that headline sounds better than that headline until you get it
00:33:35,00:33:40,And so it was a it was a war of fake news or exaggeration or exaggeration rather. Yeah
00:33:40,00:33:43,I didn't know that was where it came from because you still sometimes refer to the get you know
00:33:43,00:33:46,Sometimes one his yellow journalism
00:33:46,00:33:50,Because it was um a time of fake news hugely
00:33:50,00:33:57,"In fact, there was an issue of the journalist, which I guess is the um sort of paper that analyzes journalism in 1892"
00:33:57,00:34:00,That estimated that the majority of stories supplied to newspapers
00:34:00,00:34:07,Were fiction or just completely made up and if you weren't going to make something out people staged their own things
00:34:07,00:34:12,So um journalists would kind of try to create a mad a mad event
00:34:12,00:34:18,There was one I think this is the 1880s in buffalo new york who bought a cadaver's arm
00:34:18,00:34:23,And then cut it up into loads of pieces dropped all the pieces in the canal and then found one of the fingers
00:34:24,00:34:28,And then wrote an article on whereas this finger come from what they're doing in the canal
00:34:28,00:34:33,Why isn't there a missing person and created a big storm that everyone else reported on and then you know
00:34:33,00:34:38,Other bits turned up in the canal that other people found that's a good question for microsoft interview
00:34:38,00:34:44,"I've just found a finger in a canal. What's going on? No, no, that's a good way of losing a job"
00:34:44,00:34:48,I'm just trying to get out
00:34:48,00:34:51,I think you should answer not set the questions andy. That's what we're learning here
00:34:52,00:34:56,I think if you go into the interview with extra questions that they should ask that's another power move
00:34:56,00:35:00,You're answering back with a question of your own
00:35:00,00:35:06,"Use yeah when they say at the end of the interview. Do you have any questions for us? You're like, yeah, tell me where I got these fingers from"
00:35:06,00:35:11,We're just on spacemans quickly
00:35:11,00:35:16,We're talking fake news and we're talking about the fact that the word means obviously someone in space
00:35:16,00:35:22,But it also in newspapers. I have found a spaceman that combines all three of those things
00:35:22,00:35:24,"Oh, wow. So"
00:35:24,00:35:26,An astronaut who was paid by
00:35:26,00:35:29,The I've cheated it. Okay. It's not a real astronaut
00:35:29,00:35:34,It's someone who spent a large part of their time in space but in the world of television and film
00:35:34,00:35:39,It's Sir Patrick Stewart. So Jean-Luc Picard of the ss enterprise. Yeah
00:35:39,00:35:41,he
00:35:41,00:35:44,Used to be a local journal
00:35:44,00:35:46,When he was a young when he was age 15
00:35:46,00:35:51,"He um, he left school and he stayed in the area. He was living in which was murray field"
00:35:52,00:35:55,And he joined a local newspaper. And so he became their
00:35:55,00:35:59,Person who would sort of write up the births and deaths all the announcements
00:35:59,00:36:05,And then he would go to local plays and so on and he would watch them and do little bits of critique writing as well
00:36:05,00:36:10,"Can I just check this is the character, right? This is Sir Patrick Stewart. Sorry. This is Sir Patrick Stewart"
00:36:10,00:36:16,"That's not the backstory of captain Picard and Star Trek. I started out in local journalism, of course before I started"
00:36:16,00:36:21,Spreading peace through the universe seems like I was joking but genuine now. Let's do that whole thing going
00:36:21,00:36:26,So did all the star trek people have backstories based on their earth jobs? They're always reading the newspapers
00:36:26,00:36:31,They've got a little printing press in the back on the enterprise. The actual backstory is that his family were in vineyards
00:36:31,00:36:36,"Yeah, so there you go. Also, was it the USS enterprise? I had to stop saying anything"
00:36:36,00:36:42,I know no no glad I've got that in because otherwise that sounds like a Nazi ship chasing after them the ss enterprise
00:36:42,00:36:47,"I was thinking to myself there'll be so many letters, but I I just didn't want to interrupt your flow"
00:36:47,00:36:55,"So yeah, the USS enterprise and so Sir Patrick Stewart before he was an actor. He was a local journalist, but"
00:36:55,00:37:01,He because he was busy getting ready for his acting world used to have a lot of evenings where he would go and practice his own plays
00:37:01,00:37:06,So in some cases he never saw the play that he was meant to see and critique
00:37:06,00:37:11,He would call people up and say what was it like or he just made it up and he often made up a lot of the news
00:37:11,00:37:17,So he a spaceman in two forms was responsible for fake news brilliant very nice combination
00:37:17,00:37:22,"Also, we love you. Can I just something that I find so weird about journalism around this period"
00:37:22,00:37:29,We've been talking about when it changed is that the revolutionary thing that was happening was it was going into the inverted pyramid
00:37:29,00:37:31,"Structure, which is a"
00:37:31,00:37:35,"Term it's still taught today the inverted pyramid. Yeah, there you go"
00:37:35,00:37:38,And the inverted pyramid is how we read almost all journalism and it's very simple the way it works
00:37:39,00:37:44,Is that at the top of an article you have the amazing most newsworthy big news
00:37:44,00:37:47,And then the second bit of the article is the next bit of the pyramid
00:37:47,00:37:50,Which is the important details in it
00:37:50,00:37:53,And then the third bit of the article is like background general information
00:37:53,00:37:58,"You know, can you be asked to get there? Maybe if you've got nothing else on the day. Yeah, exactly"
00:37:58,00:38:02,But that and we're so used to reading stories like that. It's hard to imagine journalism written another way
00:38:02,00:38:08,But I was reading from when it was done in narrative style where you just start at the beginning of a story
00:38:08,00:38:13,And you would move on and I don't know if you guys have ever read the Associated Press report from april
00:38:13,00:38:16,1865
00:38:16,00:38:18,From the report from ford theater. Have I?
00:38:18,00:38:26,What year what year this is lincoln sure is here's how it begins. This is the the story
00:38:26,00:38:30,president lincoln and wife visited ford theater this evening
00:38:30,00:38:36,For the purpose of witnessing the performance of the american cousin
00:38:36,00:38:40,It was announced in the papers that general grant would also be present
00:38:40,00:38:46,But that gentleman's a late train of cast for new jersey. Hang on. Is this a patrick stewart thing where he hadn't actually been but he just
00:38:46,00:38:49,wrote it up
00:38:49,00:38:52,You've buried the lead and the president
00:38:52,00:38:56,It's so weird how far until we get to it
00:38:56,00:39:02,It's third paragraph the next paragraph is the theater was densely crowded everyone seemed delighted with the scene before them etc
00:39:02,00:39:07,"etc, and then it goes on to say a sound was heard and someone ran across the"
00:39:07,00:39:15,Stage and he said these were if finally it's the groans of mrs. Lincoln first disclosed the fact that the president had been shot
00:39:15,00:39:22,"I mean, isn't that amazing? Was there a headline on this piece?"
00:39:22,00:39:29,"That's such a good question. I don't think there was because this might have predated big headlines. Yeah, I think this predated big headlines"
00:39:29,00:39:34,"Yeah, there was no dog stick that would be inappropriate. No, so you really had to focus on you really had to read the full thing"
00:39:34,00:39:38,You never know whether this is the most important story of the decade
00:39:38,00:39:44,Imagine not having somehow missed the news that Lincoln had been killed and you're just reading a nice review and that pops up halfway through
00:39:44,00:39:46,"Sorry, what?"
00:39:46,00:39:47,What?
00:39:47,00:39:48,What about the play? Yeah
00:39:48,00:39:55,"Another phrase that you might say to do with journalism is today's news is tomorrow's fish and ship paper, right?"
00:39:55,00:39:59,So I'll think about that because I've moved to a seaside town and I'm getting a lot of fish and ships at the moment
00:39:59,00:40:04,And I ain't seeing any newspapers. They're not wrapped in it. So I think that might be something that's been phased out
00:40:04,00:40:07,But what do we know about the newspapers? Where did they get them from?
00:40:07,00:40:11,"Oh, you run a fish and ship? Yeah, where did you where did you get your newspapers from?"
00:40:11,00:40:16,They can pick them up off the street when they're discarded. So that's a bit disgusting. I don't want to know it. I mean
00:40:16,00:40:22,"It's a bit disgusting. Yeah, okay. I will only I will actually only have my fish and chips from a copy of the daily telegraph"
00:40:24,00:40:29,"Because you get more chips that way. It's a massive paper. It's a big. Yeah. Yeah, you got the job"
00:40:29,00:40:37,"No, so what it is is one thing you probably will have noticed is that if you ever opened up your fish and chips"
00:40:37,00:40:42,You never had the front page of a newspaper. You would always have had something from the body of the newspaper
00:40:42,00:40:46,So they never used old newspapers. What would happen is at the end of the day at a news agent
00:40:46,00:40:49,They would have return copies that they would need to send back
00:40:49,00:40:52,But that's huge and bulky and what are the papers going to do with it? They don't need it
00:40:52,00:40:57,So what you would do as a news agent is you'd rip off the front page or enough that you would have the date
00:40:57,00:41:01,And the title of the newspaper and you send that back to the newspapers to get your refund
00:41:01,00:41:06,And then you give your unread newspapers to the fish and chips and they use it from there
00:41:06,00:41:09,Hang on. So the newspaper will refund you for just sending the front page
00:41:09,00:41:12,It's proof that you haven't sold the paper. I guess which is the main thing
00:41:12,00:41:16,"They don't actually physically want it back unless they're trying to pulp it, which I guess they weren't doing"
00:41:16,00:41:19,"So, yeah, that's brilliant. That's amazing. Yeah"
00:41:20,00:41:26,"Wow, that's really cool. I remember thinking if I had a big printout image of ink on it"
00:41:26,00:41:27,I don't want that on my chips
00:41:27,00:41:31,"No, well now you get fish and chips delivered on um, bbc news articles online"
00:41:31,00:41:35,It's on the kindle these days. I get mine. Mine keep popping up as alerts
00:41:35,00:41:38,"Oh, I don't need another chip"
00:41:38,00:41:48,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact"
00:41:48,00:41:52,My fact this week is that there is a spider in east africa that really wants to eat us
00:41:52,00:42:00,"But because it can't it finds other animals that have eaten us and eats that instead brilliant. Yeah, it's it's extremely clever"
00:42:00,00:42:05,This is the east african spider. It's sometimes known as a vampire spider and it really wants to eat us
00:42:05,00:42:11,"It wants our blood so much hence the word vampire, but it doesn't have pincers that can penetrate enough"
00:42:11,00:42:17,It doesn't want to be killed. It's got all sorts of issues. So what it's done is it's identified that if it instead
00:42:18,00:42:23,Didn't eat us and then hunted female mosquitoes instead that had just eaten us
00:42:23,00:42:28,"It could get the juicy juicy blood out of them. So when you say eats animals, it's mosquitoes mainly because"
00:42:28,00:42:31,I read that as
00:42:31,00:42:37,"Like I don't know what lions. Yeah, I lie and it's just and they go oh wow the lion's got a really good tourist"
00:42:37,00:42:42,"I'm going right after that lion. Yeah, no, it's it's specifically mosquitoes hence the vampire thing"
00:42:42,00:42:45,"by the way, this was discovered in australia macquarie university and"
00:42:46,00:42:50,"Basically, they wanted to see what the eating habits of this of this spider wear and wine"
00:42:50,00:42:53,So they did that they put in mosquitoes in there that didn't have any human blood in it
00:42:53,00:42:58,And then they put in female mosquitoes that did and they kept noticing that it could smell it out
00:42:58,00:43:01,Even by sight because they tested it two different ways
00:43:01,00:43:05,There was one where they put it in front of mosquitoes and let it smell the you know a male
00:43:05,00:43:11,A hungry female or a full female pick the full female and then it showed them from behind glass like an id parade
00:43:12,00:43:17,"The same thing a male an empty female and a full female, but it couldn't smell them, but it definitely knew it sort of said"
00:43:17,00:43:24,Really like a menu. It's a really clever thing. I like the sound of it. They're really cool. They're also really into smelly socks
00:43:24,00:43:25,That's the other thing
00:43:25,00:43:28,"So they explain that to me. Well, it's appealing to mosquitoes"
00:43:28,00:43:32,smelly socks contain secretions from your foot
00:43:32,00:43:38,Which smell good to mosquitoes so mosquitoes are seeking those out. So the spider is going whether mosquitoes are likely to be
00:43:39,00:43:44,"Oh, this is just what a genius. That's brilliant. This has blown my mind because you know how people have sweet blood"
00:43:44,00:43:49,"And they say, oh, yeah, they always get bitten. Oh, yeah, it's because they have sweet blood and that's sort of colloquialism"
00:43:49,00:43:51,The truth is your feet stink
00:43:51,00:43:56,You got really stinky socks. So forget the sweet blood thing. That's just your mom trying to be nice
00:43:56,00:44:00,I've never noticed mosquitoes gathering around my feet
00:44:00,00:44:02,That'll be a that's the superpower no one wants
00:44:02,00:44:08,Could I talk a little bit about other animals that have vampire in the name?
00:44:08,00:44:10,"Oh, yeah, the vampire"
00:44:10,00:44:12,Brand it's very strong
00:44:12,00:44:17,"Not all of them glitter, but it's just interesting that you can have a vampire squirrel bear with me"
00:44:17,00:44:24,So this is a rare tufted ground squirrel that is only found in the hilly forests of borneo
00:44:24,00:44:29,And it is notable not just because it has the taste for blood reportedly
00:44:29,00:44:32,But also because it has an incredibly bushy tail
00:44:32,00:44:36,It has the busiest tail of any mammal compared to its body size
00:44:36,00:44:38,"Again, it's called the vampire squirrel"
00:44:38,00:44:44,And I just think is it a vampire squirrel or is it just a very big tail squirrel?
00:44:44,00:44:47,But it likes blood
00:44:47,00:44:50,"Yeah, I mean that that it doesn't matter how big your tail is if you like blood you're a vampire"
00:44:50,00:44:53,I guess so the species is really very bizarre
00:44:53,00:44:56,So the tail is 30 larger than the rest of its body
00:44:56,00:45:01,"But in terms of like the blood it will eat gynacorns, of course it will"
00:45:01,00:45:05,But it also will perch on low branches and then jump onto a deer
00:45:06,00:45:08,Go into its jugular vein
00:45:08,00:45:10,And also disembowel the carcass
00:45:10,00:45:12,"Okay, sorry"
00:45:12,00:45:16,"No, I know there's no squirrel that can take down a deer. It's not taking"
00:45:16,00:45:21,If it's disemboweling the carcass and it's step one is jump onto it from your tree
00:45:21,00:45:24,"No, but it but it's the pincing must be like a vulcan death grip, right?"
00:45:24,00:45:29,Like it must be a pinch or whatever that is more letters coming in goes through the neck takes it down
00:45:29,00:45:32,If you can get the right spot you can incapacitate
00:45:32,00:45:37,It's just like I've I've seen lions fighting with deer for minutes on end
00:45:37,00:45:39,But they're the same size the same size
00:45:39,00:45:43,It's like have you ever had a kid punch you in the balls? Not you
00:45:43,00:45:48,But have you know like fighting a kid it takes a while before you can get a good punch in you think that's
00:45:48,00:45:51,You think fighting a kid
00:45:51,00:45:59,So you're saying fighting a kid is harder than fighting a fully grown adder. I'm saying it's like even so many fights
00:46:00,00:46:05,Marguerite seafront is full of is littered with bodies large and small give me a fish
00:46:05,00:46:11,"No, if a little thing is crawling a spider crawling on you whatever it's hard to"
00:46:11,00:46:15,"It's hard to punch a spider. Yeah, and if it's on your balls, you're in big trouble"
00:46:15,00:46:18,As the saying goes
00:46:18,00:46:24,"Look, I will say it's not been scientifically observed that there have been deer kills in this manner"
00:46:24,00:46:28,But the local tribe these are the forest dwelling dyke hunters
00:46:28,00:46:34,Say that it does attack and kill deer to eat their stomach contents. Yeah. So again squirrels cute
00:46:34,00:46:36,Yeah
00:46:36,00:46:41,So the spider you wouldn't think is very vampire-ary as well because its length is five millimeters long
00:46:41,00:46:45,So we're talking about like a little tiny little thing here is very very small
00:46:45,00:46:50,"The most vampire-ary thing of the animals has to be the vampire bat. That's a fair shout. I think yeah, yeah"
00:46:50,00:46:56,Because it literally and I was reading about the vampire bats and we've mentioned a couple things about them in the past
00:46:56,00:46:58,But what I didn't know is is that if they are taking blood from an animal
00:46:58,00:47:02,So a vampire bat will land on the ground and crawl over sink the fangs in
00:47:02,00:47:08,If it's a if it's a particularly hairy animal and the animals usually sleep it will shave the animal
00:47:08,00:47:12,"Yeah, it uses its teeth and cheek teeth"
00:47:12,00:47:17,It's got cheek teeth inside and it will shave a patch as if it's about to do surgery and then it will put its fangs in
00:47:17,00:47:20,So it does it's like a barber. It's just a little schik schik schik
00:47:20,00:47:23,You'll wake up with ball patches all over you and you'll know that someone sucked your blood
00:47:23,00:47:24,"Yeah, I guess so if you're an animal"
00:47:24,00:47:28,And do we know is that because you know how it's very unpleasant to kiss someone who hasn't shaved
00:47:28,00:47:32,Is that because it's also unpleasant to drink blood from someone who hasn't shaved?
00:47:32,00:47:36,Is that just to make it a more comfortable experience for them? I think you you get your food in their beard
00:47:36,00:47:40,"Uh, you know what I mean? Yeah, that's cool on that. Is that other documentary the twits?"
00:47:43,00:47:45,"Uh, um, this is a"
00:47:45,00:47:52,An acting related fact for these spiders. There's a spider which only survives because it's a bad actor
00:47:52,00:47:57,"Oh, it's like it's one of those spiders that fakes a death kind of thing to avoid predators thinking it's alive"
00:47:57,00:47:59,And you pity them because they're so bad
00:47:59,00:48:09,"Oh, wow, he's got a lot of work. I don't eat that and then you ali you go soft on it in the press tour"
00:48:09,00:48:14,"I do. You know, you think it doesn't deserve well. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so this is called sila calling woody"
00:48:14,00:48:19,And it pretends to be an ant right because ants are often quite scary for predators
00:48:19,00:48:21,They've got strong jaws and they can really bite you back as it were
00:48:21,00:48:23,So a lot of predators avoid them
00:48:23,00:48:28,This spider doesn't have that but it lifts up its front legs and waves them around as if they're antennae
00:48:28,00:48:32,"Oh, okay, um, and it shakes his abdomen about so it looks a bit like it looks a bit like an ant"
00:48:32,00:48:36,But its impression is so bad that it could be any one of multiple ant species
00:48:37,00:48:40,"Effectively, it's not a very good specific ant impression"
00:48:40,00:48:45,But that means it deters multiple predators. That's great because it could it sort of looks a bit like loads of ants
00:48:45,00:48:50,It's like me being able to do one accent which actually sounds plausibly like loads of different countries
00:48:50,00:48:52,It could have come from my life cania
00:48:52,00:48:57,"Exactly. Yeah, um, it's an all-round in person. It's a generic impersonation"
00:48:57,00:49:01,It's that's the shoulder. Am I doing a Welsh accent? Am I doing a completely different accent? It doesn't matter
00:49:01,00:49:06,It's the factory setting of accents. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So every animal goes
00:49:07,00:49:12,"It's like if something's on the turn. It's like, I think it's okay to eat, but it might be that poisonous one. It might be an ant. Yeah"
00:49:12,00:49:16,"Yeah, exactly bin. Yeah. Yeah, um, this spider is only found in Lake Victoria"
00:49:16,00:49:21,You know how big Lake Victoria is big. It's so big. It's so biggy
00:49:21,00:49:26,It's six times the size of Yorkshire. That's bigger or smaller than that manhawk cover. You are
00:49:26,00:49:33,"It's ginormous. ginormous. This lake is massive. Um, yeah, it's the just it's so it's uh, it's east Africa. It's um"
00:49:34,00:49:39,"Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, right? The three countries on its borders. It's so I love this. It's so big"
00:49:39,00:49:44,It's one of only two places in east Africa where you can watch the sunset over water
00:49:44,00:49:47,But you're not on the coast. Oh
00:49:47,00:49:52,"Yeah, that's nice. You just look out and the sunset and it's it's actually there's more land on the other side of it"
00:49:52,00:49:56,"Yeah, it's kind of cool. That is cool. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's basically half of England"
00:49:56,00:50:00,"That's big. That is large and it's amazing, isn't it? It's an ecological wonder"
00:50:00,00:50:04,I didn't know about this at all and it kind of helps you out Dan
00:50:04,00:50:11,"Um, just to update you Ellie Dan makes references to evolution a lot and occasionally they are verging on incorrect"
00:50:11,00:50:16,But it does help out your evolutionary arguments when sometimes you assume evolution can happen quite fast
00:50:16,00:50:17,"Oh, yeah, Victoria"
00:50:17,00:50:23,It's like zoom and it seems like we don't really know why and this is specifically these cichlids
00:50:23,00:50:28,"So about 16,000 years ago. There were three species of cichlid, which is a kind of fish"
00:50:28,00:50:30,You see them in aquariums a lot
00:50:30,00:50:36,"Um, there were three species of cichlid there. There are by the mid 20th century. There were over 500 species"
00:50:36,00:50:40,And now that is an incredibly short amount of time for them all to have
00:50:40,00:50:44,Shagged mutated turned into different species not been able to yeah
00:50:44,00:50:49,And as far as I can tell one of the reasons it happened so far seems to be that they're quite bad swimmers
00:50:49,00:50:55,"So so they get stuck in specific bits exactly doing their own breeding. Yeah, exactly"
00:50:55,00:51:00,You get a loose touch with yeah loose touch with the home the home planet how interesting
00:51:00,00:51:02,Cichlids carry their newly hatched offspring in their mouths
00:51:02,00:51:05,That's another reason why they don't breed very much
00:51:05,00:51:09,They could not compete because it limits your breeding drastically a rubbish at kissing
00:51:09,00:51:16,Give me a give me a cichlid image. What's a cichlid? It's like you think think of a fish in an aquarium in a shop
00:51:16,00:51:20,"Yeah, it's like that. Okay, right. It looks like a nice classic fish"
00:51:20,00:51:21,"Yeah, no, you're right"
00:51:21,00:51:26,That's not good for like a date night where you go to kiss lay up in their mouth and the children are in there
00:51:26,00:51:29,Anything I should know
00:51:29,00:51:35,She was a lovely great listener. She sounds a bit like Michael Cabe

00:52:30,00:52:32,Goodbye
00:52:32,00:52:37,Guys before we go
00:52:37,00:52:39,I've googled it
00:52:39,00:52:42,So how many times do the two hands on a clock coincide?
00:52:44,00:52:49,"In a 24 hour period. Okay, so the obvious guess was 12. I think it's gonna be 24 or 24"
00:52:49,00:52:56,"24 they did a 24 hour period. Oh, sorry. It's 24 hours. Sorry. It was in the question. You're out of the interview process"
00:52:56,00:53:01,Get your stuff and leave early and ask Selena always read the top of the exam paper
00:53:01,00:53:04,I need final answers guys 22 23 22 for
00:53:04,00:53:06,Andy
00:53:06,00:53:08,23 for Anna. It makes no sense. I'm just gonna split the difference
00:53:08,00:53:12,22.5. 22.5. Yep. Okay. That was a terrible idea
00:53:13,00:53:17,I'm out. Look bloody. There we go. Bye. The answer is 22 times. Andy's right
00:53:17,00:53:22,The hands coincide at times 12 o'clock 105 211 3 16 and so on
00:53:22,00:53:28,Every 65 minutes not 60 minutes. They coincide 11 times in 12 hours. Therefore 22 times in 24 hours
00:53:28,00:53:33,So when I thought it was 12 then I was right with 11
00:53:33,00:53:35,Because I was so stupid
00:53:35,00:53:38,I didn't even listen to the wording of the question and that is how you don't get the job
00:53:38,00:53:43,And that's why Andy is now working at Microsoft. Thank you very much. I cannot excuse why I made my guess
