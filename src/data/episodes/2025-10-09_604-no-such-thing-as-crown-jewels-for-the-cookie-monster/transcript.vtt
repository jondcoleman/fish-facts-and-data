00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
 Hello Clubfish members, welcome to this week's episode of Fish and a special top of show

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.200
 announcement just for you.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.520
 Now, first things first, let's get the guest out of the way.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.040
 Bit rude for me to say that, I suppose, considering it was the fantastic Melanie Bray's

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.040
 well.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.760
 Melanie's a really good friend of ours, we've known her for many, many years.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.640
 She's a regular on Australian television in New Zealand as well.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.520
 She's been on New Zealand Taskmaster.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.200
 She hosts a TV show called Cheap Seats Australia, but you've seen her on TV in the UK as well.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.080
 She's been on QI a couple of times, and she has very recently been on Richard Osmond's

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.600
 House of Games.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.400
 She's a brilliant stand-up comedian as well though, and so if you would like to see her

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.240
 on tour, great news.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:52.440
 She's coming to the UK and her tickets are available at MelanieBraySwell.com/taw.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.000
 So do get tickets for that, and, indeed, speaking of people who are going on tour, we are doing

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.680
 a live show very soon, and it is an unbelievably exciting one.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.140
 It is at the Royal Institution, no less.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.000
 Can you believe they are letting us in to the venerable building to do a podcast.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.560
 It's just before Christmas, the 20th of December, there'll be a very, very special guest there

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.560
 on stage with us.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.800
 However, it's going to be a whole load of Christmassy and Society fun, and so definitely

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.800
 come along to that.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.520
 If you would like tickets for that, get in there fast because it's a pretty small venue,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.280
 and we're not announcing it to the main feed for a little while.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.040
 This is just for you, Club Fishers.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.840
 If you go to nosichthingsandfish.com/ri, you'll be able to get details for that show.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.600
 Anyway, enough about the future.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.960
 It's all about the present, and this week's show with MelanieBraySwell, so really help

00:01:43.960 --> 00:02:02.360
 you enjoy it, and all that's left to say is on with the podcast!

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.520
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.240
 week coming to you from four undisclosed locations around the globe.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.640
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.360
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, a special guest.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.720
 It's MelanieBraySwell, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.080
 four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.320
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Mel.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.480
 My fact this week is that a congested tunnel in Australia has installed moving lights

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.600
 that you race against, and it has helped reduce stop, start traffic by 70%.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.960
 And I drive this tunnel frequently.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.160
 Do you, and you've done the racing against the lights?

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.200
 Yeah, I mean, when I say race, I don't think that's what you're actually supposed to do.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.080
 It's what I do, but it's essentially, it keeps pace with kind of the slowest traffic in

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.080
 the tunnel.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.840
 Therefore, the pace is consistent, and people aren't driving super fast, and then stopping,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.920
 and then driving, and then stopping, because that's what causes traffic.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.760
 I had a look at it, and from the look of it, I mean, I haven't driven it obviously, but

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.080
 it looks like a ring of light around the edge of the tunnel, which sort of pulses through

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.720
 the tunnel, and you drive level with that ring.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.720
 Is that right?

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.720
 As it moves.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.160
 Yeah, so if you look in your lesson right, there's sort of these green lines that you are

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.040
 trying to keep pace with, and it feels really bad when one of the green lines overtakes

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.040
 you.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.880
 Maybe it would have been better, like, it doesn't have to be lights, right?

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.800
 I thought about like a Pac-Man coming and trying to do something really good.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800
 Oh, yes.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.200
 But once you see it in your review, hang on, you're the ghost.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.080
 Yeah, you're the ghost in this situation.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.440
 Well, maybe, wait a minute, you're the Pac-Man, and that's the ghost, the ghost is chasing

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.440
 it.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.240
 It's too, we can't have a, like, you're the baddie in this situation.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.960
 I caused a collision, but I didn't get a high score.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.400
 Can you eat the strawberry turn around, and then you can drive backwards through the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.920
 tunnel, that's right, yeah, yeah.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.160
 So from the sound of it, the problem is that people drive downhill into the tunnel, they

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.920
 drive a longer tunnel, and then they drive up on the way out, but they slow down on the

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.280
 way up, because they don't really register that there's an uphill slope on the way out.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.440
 So naturally, you just slow down, and that causes a ripple effect going all the way back

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.680
 through the tunnel, and then everyone slows down.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.400
 Yeah, and so since this has been installed, there's been a 17% increase in speed.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.680
 When there is traffic, it returns to the normal speed, 95% faster compared to before that

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.680
 installed.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.680
 It's really good.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.000
 They heard there's, like, a lot less breakdowns as well, because usually trucks are, like,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.480
 stopping and starting with their brakes, but when they're not using their brakes as much,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.000
 there's less things that can go wrong.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 So they're breaking up.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 I thought you meant emotional breakdowns, and that too.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.960
 Can I just quickly say, this is an absolute nightmare, though, for a super villain to hack,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.440
 and then set the lights going to 200 miles an hour.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.720
 Wow, that is a great, that is a great plot, any super villain's listening.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.480
 But then the police can kind of slow them right down when they're doing the chase, can't

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480
 they?

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.480
 Yes.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.480
 I hadn't thought of that.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.880
 James, let's talk scripts later, but I think we're all just up again.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.800
 So this is a tunnel in Melbourne, and James, you just mentioned about trucks stopping

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.800
 and starting.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.080
 Truck seemed to be a big problem for tunnels in Australia, generally, and there were

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.440
 a few management systems have been put in place to help them.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.600
 So the Sydney Harbor Tunnel.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.300
 They have a system in place for trucks that are constantly ignoring signs that say, your

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.400
 truck may be too high, stop if you are at this high, and they'll get to the entrances of

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.400
 this tunnel.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.520
 They'll crash in, stuck, right?

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.960
 So this new system is in place there, a sheet like a waterfall will go over the front

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.440
 of the tunnel, and then they laser project a giant stop sign onto the waterfall.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.800
 So it's literally in front of them, and you can't ignore it.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.800
 You have to stop.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.680
 Oh, it's like a log flume.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.680
 I love that.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.560
 You'd be like, ah, no, it's a truck.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.560
 It's going to move at the last second.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.200
 If I've seen any cartoons, and I have, I know I'll get through here.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.640
 Are you saying that that exists, Stan, Sydney?

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.000
 In the Sydney Harbor Tunnel, and quite a few other tunnels.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 Yeah.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.600
 So it literally has an emergency moment.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.600
 Oh, man.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.640
 You want to see it though, but the only way to do it is that you have a truck too high.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.560
 Honestly, next time we're in Australia, I have hired in a truck, and I have fly

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.560
 in towards that tunnel.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.560
 Yeah.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.560
 I'm very tall.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.080
 I should just get like, just stand on top of a car and make it happen.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.960
 So do you ever drive around in Queensland, Mel?

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.960
 Not often.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.960
 Okay.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.960
 Okay.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.960
 Okay.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.960
 It's a big country, Andy.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.960
 No further questions.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.280
 Well, it's not where I live, so if I was to go to Queensland, I'd be more likely to order

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.280
 a can.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.280
 Okay.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.280
 So you don't do interstate trucking in Queensland.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.280
 There's what I'm doing.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.280
 Not so much these days.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.720
 That is shame because if you do, the highways are basically a large, slow pub quiz.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.680
 So Queensland is seven times as high as the UK, just for context.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.840
 And you know, you get people driving, do you get the road trains?

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.840
 Do you get those in Queensland?

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.840
 I think you might do.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.840
 Anyway.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.840
 What?

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.840
 I'm sorry, Andy.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.840
 Andy, Andy.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.840
 It's a road track.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.840
 Yeah.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.840
 You just put two words together that don't really fit together.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.320
 It's like a convoy of trucks.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.280
 And you, you know, it's halfway between just normal logistics and Mad Max, because you're driving

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.000
 across Australia with a load of trucks and it's a road train.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.800
 Anyway, if you're a trucker in Australia, in a road train or out, it's obviously really

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.400
 boring and there are long stretches of just nothing for ages and ages and ages.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.800
 And so you have to keep drivers engaged.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:39.200
 And so Queensland's authorities have put a pub quiz basically on the signs around

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200
 the state.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.320
 So you will see a sign saying, which animal is the fastest on earth?

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.120
 And then like five miles later, you'll see a sign saying, it's the Paragram Falcon when

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.120
 it's diving.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.960
 Is it, it counts as on earth if it's diving?

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.960
 It's a good point.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.960
 No, you're right, James.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.960
 I mean, Quibble, do right in, too.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.960
 Okay.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.320
 Well, the next sign says, no, no, we do realise that it's not actually on the earth.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.320
 No, okay.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:09.240
 Let's have another couple just to see if you're as smart as a road train captain.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.560
 What is the coldest town in Queensland?

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.040
 It'll be like Wollongong or something like somewhere south.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.040
 Well, no.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040
 Is it right?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.040
 No.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.040
 Oh, of course.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.040
 This is around the world.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.000
 It'll be screaming, screaming at their phones.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Okay.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.400
 And the last one, when is rabbit breeding season?

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.800
 Oh, it's, that's all the time in Australia, isn't it?

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800
 Correct.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.800
 Trick question.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.880
 I'd be so pissed off after five miles if I heard, kind of by a trick question.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.880
 Beautiful.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.880
 Yeah.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.520
 It's, um, the roads in Australia are pretty mental.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.720
 The, um, the longest road in the world is the one that goes round Australia.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.720
 Highway one.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.720
 Oh.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.360
 It's 9,000 miles long.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.400
 And if instead of putting it all the way around Australia, they decided to go from Perth

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.440
 outwards, they could have got all the way to London.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.440
 Stop it.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.440
 Whoa.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.440
 That's, why didn't they?

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.960
 They should remember that.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.960
 Fools.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.680
 The flights are so tedious.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.040
 I could just have 15,000 pub trivia questions.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.680
 I, it would be done in no time.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.360
 No, the scale is mad, isn't it?

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.360
 It is.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.080
 Because if you, if you break down as well in 2017, there was a tradesman who crashed his car

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.440
 out in the outback on one of these roads.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.920
 And the closest help he could get was I believe 150 kilometers away, which he had to walk.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.920
 So he did.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.920
 Yeah.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.480
 So he did this walk, survived initially on water, had to start drinking his own urine, um,

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:42.160
 and finally got found after he'd walked about 100 or 120 kilometers.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.720
 So he only had like 30 to go before he could have rocked up to this town going.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.720
 You won't believe what I did.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.720
 Please.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.720
 I'm so thirsty.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.040
 Can a, can a very oversized truck go through this tunnel?

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.040
 Right?

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.680
 Have you, so, Mel, have you heard of the outback way?

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.720
 Because I don't know if this is the road you're talking about just there, Dan.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.200
 So this is, it's a series of roads and it runs from the middle of Western Australia to

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.200
 the middle of Queensland.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.360
 So that is over two and a half thousand kilometers, it's really long.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:12.480
 Um, I think much of it is not paved and a lot of it you need permission to go over, um,

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.680
 and some bits are just for remote indigenous communities.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.760
 And it's known as the world's longest shortcut because it does technically shave time off

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.800
 your roof, if you are as opposed to going up and then right around highway one that James

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.800
 was talking about.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.080
 But it was made by this guy called Len Bidell.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.080
 Is he a house or daim in Australia, Mel?

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.080
 Oh, Len Bidell.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.080
 He started a limb.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.080
 Okay.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.080
 Oh, man.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.440
 Did he win, uh, dancing with his stars this year?

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.440
 Oh, man.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.440
 Okay.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.440
 Okay.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.200
 So it's not a house or a name, but he's just an amazing guy.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.560
 So he, he wrote a lot of books about his time.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.480
 He just made roads all his life and his books include beating about the bush too long in

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:57.200
 the bush, still in the bush, blast the bush and bush bashers.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.560
 And um, he named them all after members of his family.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.560
 So there's the Gary highway.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.040
 There's the conny suit highway.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.720
 The bugs were named after the members of his family.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:11.800
 This one's after my daughter Bush, Bidell, um, but the amazing thing about him was he was

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.440
 also a bush dentist, right?

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.240
 So he knew that he was going to be out with a road building crew for ages.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.200
 So he took a course in tooth extraction in case anyone got a toothache, you know, because

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.400
 obviously you're hundreds of miles from the nearest dentist.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.000
 So by the time that he and his crew had finished the gun barrel highway, which was his first

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.960
 really long road, uh, he'd taken 29 teeth from his crew.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.960
 Wow.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.960
 That's stunning.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.960
 Wow.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.960
 Those can't all have been necessary.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.960
 Yeah.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.960
 I think he's gone.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.960
 I've got the qualification.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.960
 I'll be stupid if I don't use them.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.320
 I had a fact for James actually on this one.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.880
 So there's a road in Australia, which James would probably find so attractive.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.480
 Any pictures from the other two as to why?

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.520
 Oh, because you can play.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.520
 It's got golf holes.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.520
 Oh.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.520
 It's gone way through.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.520
 I mean.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.520
 Am I that one?

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.520
 I bet you still has a character.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.520
 Sorry, James.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.520
 I'm so sorry, James.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.360
 But the, is it pronounced Nalaba?

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.360
 No.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.360
 Nalaba plain.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.360
 Nalaba links.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.360
 And you're right.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.360
 No, it James.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.160
 Nalaba means no trees, right?

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.160
 It does.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.160
 It does.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160
 It's also a good place to play golf.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.160
 Oh.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.160
 There's no trees.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.160
 But also Andy.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.160
 Yeah.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.560
 Mal is a New Zealander who's just emigrated to Australia.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.560
 Give her a break.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.560
 You know.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.560
 I don't know.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.560
 What's the warmest town in Western Australia now?

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.640
 What is the name of Len Bdell's upcoming book?

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.640
 Because we all know it.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.640
 I'm so sorry about it.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.640
 You're right.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.640
 You're right.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.640
 You're right.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.680
 That famous bush-debtist we all talk about.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:43.200
 So the Nalaba links is the world's longest golf course.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.280
 It's 850 miles long.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.280
 Oh.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.040
 Is it like 18 holes or is it?

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.640
 I believe it's still 18 holes, but they are spread out.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.640
 Oh, I see.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.320
 So you play one hole and then you drive 100 miles to the next one.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.120
 You can walk, but you're going to need to drink a lot of your own wee on the way.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.360
 You played golf with me before.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:13.400
 Do you guys know who doesn't have issues with traffic?

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.400
 Oh.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.400
 And.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.400
 Have you guys talked about this before?

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:22.400
 There's a study that they did in 2019 looking at the way that ants move because they do follow

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.800
 sort of roads leading from food back to their colonies because they lead these sort of chemical

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:34.520
 trails and they found that even with a lot of congestion, the ants never had any trouble

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.880
 with traffic or build up.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.920
 And I love the way that they did this study, which is they made tiny little bridges for

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:47.240
 ants and increased the width of the bridge or narrowed the width of the bridge and found

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.600
 that they would find alternative routes or they would kind of move in this kind of constant

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.360
 state of travel and they had no traffic issues.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.840
 And that means the problem with traffic is just us.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:04.440
 If we all just drove at a constant speed and had an eye out for each other, then we'd all

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.440
 be better off.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.600
 That's really wise, Mel.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.040
 And I think actually what I try and say sometimes is I don't say I'm sorry I'm late.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.440
 I was in traffic.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.040
 I say I'm sorry I'm late.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.040
 I was traffic.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.040
 Wow.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.040
 You know what I mean?

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.040
 It's so beautiful.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.040
 Yeah.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.320
 He's really cool to work with Mel.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.360
 That's a shame you don't get to experience these day to day, absolute zingers when he walks

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.360
 in.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:35.760
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.760
 And well, actually, because she sent in so many great facts, we're going to go and give

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.760
 her another fact.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.960
 First time we've ever done this.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.960
 Oh my gosh.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.960
 It's time for fact number two.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.960
 And that is Mel.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.960
 Wow.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.960
 Oh my gosh.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.960
 I'm flattered.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:55.480
 The fact this week is New Zealand decides new laws to debate and Parliament by pulling them

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.560
 at random out of a 30-year-old biscuit tin.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.600
 So that's amazing.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600
 Yeah.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.080
 It's true love that.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.520
 What I thought when I heard this a while ago was that they pulled the actual bills out,

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.400
 but they have numbered tokens, numbered one through 90.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:16.880
 And they are assigned to a specific, a specific bill.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.600
 Very important bills were pulled from this.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.760
 Game average was pulled from this.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.760
 Really?

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.760
 Euthanasia was pulled from this.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.760
 It's surreal.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.440
 There's a lot of significant stuff in this biscuit tin.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.440
 I know.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.440
 Exactly.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.760
 Probably the theory that no biscuit tin contains biscuits.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.640
 It's like sewing supplies or laws.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.640
 You know?

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.640
 Yummy biscuit.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.640
 I know.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.040
 It's the water care amendment bill.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.920
 New Zealand is often a socially progressive country and a few things have passed there ahead

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.120
 of the world.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:52.120
 And it sounds like it was because of the biscuit tin and having this system, these things might

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.760
 not otherwise have come up.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.520
 It's not every law.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:01.240
 It's not, it's basically ones that are presented by maybe some minor parties that don't have

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.240
 the floor.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.240
 I see.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.240
 It would be insane.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.680
 It would be insane to have every law, like just incredibly aside from the biscuit tin.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.360
 Oh, murder's legal in New Zealand because it hasn't come out of the biscuit tin yet.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.360
 Sorry.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.360
 That's what the lucky dip says.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.360
 Murderousness.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.320
 There's some stuff lurking in there.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.520
 So I think it's, I think that's right.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.920
 It's called a members bill.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:21.920
 I know.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.560
 I think Britain has an equivalent in, we have one in our parliament.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.560
 A private members bill is the British equivalent.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.960
 So if it's not part of the agenda, but you're passionate about it and it's a cause that

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.960
 you believe in.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.640
 One thing that's interesting, I think, is that in the past, obviously this biscuit tin

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.440
 has only existed for 30 years or had this role for 30 years.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.440
 It might pre-existed.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.440
 I don't know.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.280
 Before that, you would have a bit of time when you can have these special members bills

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:52.400
 and to decide which laws you would debate, you would basically have to get to the clerk first.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.560
 So they would say, okay, Thursday we've got a bit of time, we're going to do this and

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:59.360
 everyone would leg it to the clerk saying, I want my Lauren, I want my Lauren, or they

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.040
 would even queue up overnight, like they were trying to get tickets for Wimbledon or something

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.640
 just so that they could get their law debated.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.560
 Because would they ever, would the, did you say it was the clerk you needed to find?

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.560
 Yeah, that's right.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.760
 Would he, or should he ever hide and it's kind of, if you find the clerk?

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.200
 There's a thing in the UK here that I'm sure James, you and Andy will know about, but the

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.320
 division bell for UK Parliament, which is also to do with voting.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:29.280
 So if a vote needs to happen and there's a division, this bell goes off, which gives

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.320
 MPs eight minutes to get there to register their vote.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.680
 But because people are so spread out, division bells are all over Westminster.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.640
 So some local pubs will have division bells, or there will be a direct phone call to a

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.640
 landlord to ring a particular bell, or it'll be in cafes and so everywhere.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:52.520
 So you'll be sitting maybe in a pub, a lot of MPs having a pint of beer, this bell goes

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.920
 off and they'll just bolt out of there to get back to vote.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.920
 Is that still true, Andy?

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.960
 I thought they might have changed the pub one a few years ago.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.960
 I don't know.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.960
 I think the red line is a pub.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.960
 Yeah, yeah.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.960
 I don't know if it's still there.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.480
 The plan was to start phasing it out of pubs in 2021, but I think yeah, there's possible

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:14.120
 that there might be a few, but there's 384 division bells, let's say, before the phase

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.120
 out.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.120
 Yeah.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.120
 This is having a bat signal.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.120
 Basically, it's what it is, isn't it?

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.080
 Like it's just, but you need to just need to go vote on a lot.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.080
 Like it's an unsexy bat signal.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.080
 But it is cool.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.080
 Yeah.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.520
 On pubs and Parliament, New Zealand Parliament has a pub now.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.520
 It did have a pub.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.520
 It was closed down.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.520
 The pub is reopened.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:37.920
 It's called pint of order, and I think it's great.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:45.840
 And on the wall of the pub is the first sort of, they say proper bill to be passed by a newly

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:51.160
 independent Parliament, so not under the colonial governorship.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.840
 And it was for allowing Parliament to circumvent the liquor laws.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.440
 That was the first thing we wanted to do.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.240
 That was the first pint of order.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:04.880
 Yeah, put that bill in the biscuit tin at 90 times.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.720
 So we've just talked about the French Parliament.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.720
 That is shaped.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.360
 So the British Parliament is two benches, and the one side is on the left and one side is

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.000
 on the right, and they argue.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.440
 I can't remember what the New Zealand one is, but the French one is like a semicircle.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:25.360
 And the reason it is that is it's based on the School of Surgery in Paris.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:29.240
 It was a place where you would cut up bodies, and everyone had to have a good view of you

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.640
 cutting up the bodies.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.880
 And then they chose the Parliament to be based on that, which I think is really cool.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.640
 And there is one country in the world that has their Parliament in the shape of an Athletic

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.640
 Stadium.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.640
 Can you guess which it is?

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.640
 Yes, yes.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.640
 Yes, yes.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.640
 Is this an especially athletic country?

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.640
 Maybe.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.640
 You've got a guess.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.520
 Okay, so a load of Olympic long distance runners are from Kenya, aren't they?

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.520
 So I'm going to say Kenya.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.520
 But they don't.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.320
 Is it somewhere in like South America or something?

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:05.180
 You have loads of them, but like long distance runners often aren't in the stadium.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.840
 They're running like marathon running, or 10k is outside the stadium.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.840
 That's a really important thing.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.840
 Okay.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.840
 So who runs in a stadium?

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.840
 It's just sprinters.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.840
 Keep going.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.840
 Do you say in bold?

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.840
 Yeah, who is from?

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.840
 Jamaica.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.840
 Jamaica?

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.840
 Well done.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.840
 Yes.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.840
 Oh.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.840
 On the shoulders of giants.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.000
 I was using a tailwind, yeah.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.080
 So Jamaica, I've got an Athletic Stadium shaped Parliament.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.080
 That's great.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.080
 Wow.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.080
 Does it?

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.560
 When you say Athletic Stadium shaped, is there a bit in the middle where you get to

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.880
 throw the tablet?

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.880
 What?

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.880
 Yeah.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.880
 What does that mean?

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.800
 It's just because there are nine countries in the world with circular chambers.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.800
 There's quite a lot of them.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.840
 We've got hemispheres like France and like the European Parliament.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.440
 A lot of got the same as the British Parliament.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.960
 But theirs is kind of an elongated circle.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.960
 That's great.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.960
 Right.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.960
 That's really good.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.200
 There's a thing that happened in Australia a number of years ago, about 20 years ago now,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:08.920
 which is that the Parliament banned all the security staff from saying, "Good, I mate."

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:14.360
 When people walked in, they were like, "Mate, mate is not a word that we want to be encouraging

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.840
 when George Bush is walking through our doors."

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.600
 And then Prime Minister John Howard would often call Bush mate.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.320
 It was just, we don't like this word.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.880
 So security staff were told, "You can't do it anymore."

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:29.960
 And the ban lasted less than 24 hours because Australians said, "No way, mate."

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.280
 It was just like, "Are you kidding?

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.000
 That's a national pride that greeting and that word."

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.360
 Well, New Zealand has a list of words that they've deemed unparliamentary.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:47.120
 So these are words that are insulting or unbecoming and had to be retracted.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:53.840
 In 1949, the phrase, "His brains could revolve inside a pen-ut shell for a thousand years without touching the sides."

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.400
 Had to be retracted, it was deemed unparliamentary.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.680
 "Energy of a tired snail returning home from a funeral."

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.280
 That was 1963, that was deemed unparliamentary.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.920
 And this phrase, I feel like I just want to say it on my day today.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.520
 This is 1946.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.520
 "Idle vaporings of a mind diseased."

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.920
 Oh, my goodness.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.800
 So mysterious.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.800
 Sick bird.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.720
 I found a great little nugget, which is that our UK Parliament, they have their own internal library.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.360
 Back in 2013, they looked into the list of the most borrowed books from this library.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:31.120
 The number one most borrowed book from Parliament's library was a book called "How to Be an MP."

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.120
 For dummies?

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.120
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:41.280
 It was a self-help book and it had like, amazing chapters called, you know, "How to dilute boredom.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.000
 How to write an abusive letter."

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:52.420
 Yeah, how to convince voters that MPs never stop working.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.920
 How to climb the greasy pole.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.920
 Things like that.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.860
 Previously, for five years, there was another book that was the number one most borrowed

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.860
 book.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.000
 And that was called, sorry.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.240
 "How to borrow a book."

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.600
 Yeah, that one was called "How Parliament Works."

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.760
 That was the previous, yeah, most borrowed book.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.120
 Speaking of libraries, actually, the New Zealand Parliament has a library.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.640
 And in 1968, there was a big storm that hit Wellington, who's a really famous one, some

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.800
 boats capsized and stuff, so it was really, really bad.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.340
 But the water from the storm surge started going towards the Parliament and the people

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.200
 working there thought we need to get the books out of here.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.400
 So they took all the books and they took them onto the roof to keep them away from the water.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:46.080
 And this is according to a tour guide, whom does a tour of the New Zealand Parliament.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:53.680
 And they say, "For mysterious and unknown reasons, they did this in their underwear."

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:59.920
 And I can't work out why if you're going to take books out of a library and put them

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.920
 on a roof, you would do it in your underwear.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.440
 No one explained why, no one says there's no written record of her.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.800
 There had been a big storm, but it was a storm surge, which can come after the rain, so

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.200
 I don't know if it was raining or not.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.560
 I think that makes sense, because you don't want to get your clothes, if the storm surge

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:21.640
 arrives and you're in your heavy, heavy cotton ruffles or your wool, then it's good you're

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.560
 going to get seriously weighed down.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.560
 That's true.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.160
 So they took the books on the roof, you say?

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.080
 On the roof, yeah, which suggests that it might not have been raining at that point.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.160
 Yeah, okay, yeah, okay, right, right, right.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.200
 And also Andy, whenever it rains, do you just get completely naked?

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.600
 Not completely, but I think it's good.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.400
 Sometimes if you've got a job to do in the rain, it's actually better to have fewer clothes

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.400
 on.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.800
 It's like how if you're dealing with a pest or an invasive animal in your home, like a mouse

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.760
 or whatever, you don't want to get it.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.760
 You don't want to get it.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.760
 You don't want to get it out.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.760
 Of course.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.720
 Can I please finish?

00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.800
 I don't want that mouse crawling up my trouser leg.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.720
 I'd rather see it on my leg.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.560
 Do you know what I'm saying?

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.560
 No, not really.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.560
 I know, but keep going.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.560
 Keep going.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.960
 Look, it's more upsetting to have a ferret in your trouser leg than it is to have a ferret

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.960
 on your bare leg.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.960
 That's all I'm saying.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:21.440
 This is why you were kicked out of that petting zoo.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.840
 I've just got one thing about biscuit tins.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:31.160
 I think I found the third most valuable biscuit tin ever, which I know, the sold in 2019,

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.440
 it was from about 1910, beautiful biscuit tin, shaped like a bus, lovely.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.440
 Any guesses as to how much it went forward auction?

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.600
 Is there any reason why it was particularly expensive, just a nice and historic thing?

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.600
 Just nice.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.560
 I don't think it wasn't a celebrity one, it wasn't historical.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.560
 200 quid?

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.560
 3,100.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.680
 Oh, thank God you didn't ask me for mine.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.680
 I was cool.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.680
 I was cool.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.680
 Really overshoot it.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.880
 Well, Dan, do you want to have another crack at the value of the second most valuable biscuit

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.880
 tin ever?

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.880
 1.5 mil.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.880
 Great.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.880
 Thanks, Dan.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:08.640
 Thanks a bunch for absolutely torpedoing my fun game.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.240
 Mel, would you like to guess, maybe a sensible guess, as the value of the second most expensive

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.960
 biscuit tin that I've been able to find?

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.720
 Let's say 800.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.720
 Thank you.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.720
 Thanks.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.720
 How much was the first one?

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.720
 It was 3,100.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.200
 So, Mel, you have low ball bit rather given that this is more valuable than that.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.200
 We know that.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.200
 It's quite reasonable.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.200
 Less valuable.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.200
 No, this is the second.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.200
 That was the third most valuable.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.200
 This is the second most.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.200
 We're going uphill for some jeopardy, Mel.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:41.000
 Actually, I did not say the currency, but it doesn't help, but I didn't say the currency.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 I was saying.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 I was saying Bitcoin.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 I said yes.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 You know, I'm a Bitcoin, exactly.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Okay.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.200
 I got for one bit, coin, but how much do they worth, that 80 grand loads?

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.200
 This is more.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.200
 Oh, thankfully.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.560
 No, this was an island of man-man who was caught with 150 grams worth of heroin in a biscuit

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.560
 tin.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.920
 I can't wait a minute, I don't need.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.520
 How much of that value is the biscuit tin without the tin, it's worth nothing.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.480
 So, you're on a, what I did was I paid 150 grand for a biscuit tin.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.720
 I didn't know what was going to be in there.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.160
 And then the most valuable biscuit tin ever, that I've been able to find.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.160
 Okay.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:26.000
 So, inside it was Hitler's apology for the second world war.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.880
 You're so close.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.960
 There is a second world war link.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.960
 You're so close.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.440
 Wait, so is British tin?

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.000
 Is the tin the valuable item here or is the item inside it?

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.080
 I think we've worked out that the tin is irrelevant to the recall price of it.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.080
 Okay.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.760
 I'll go 1.5, Mel.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.280
 This is a really interesting episode of antics roadshow.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.280
 I love it.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.800
 1.5, Mel, let's go to Mel.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.920
 Dan, would you like to completely nuke the game again by guessing like 300 billion quid

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.920
 or something?

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:57.920
 No.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.920
 17 million.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.920
 Do you know what?

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.920
 I think it might be more than that.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.920
 What?

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.920
 I think that's priceless.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.920
 Oh.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.920
 Okay.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.920
 In the second world war.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.600
 So, I wouldn't have been nuking the game, it would have been pretty accurate.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.600
 I think that's what we've worked out.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.040
 Why haven't I been asked to quiz, and please, no one ever let Andy write the quiz questions

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.800
 for those long roads in Australia, because I swear to God, I'd be crashing my car and drinking

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.880
 my piss before I needed to see another question.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.040
 You're like, you've done the first one.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.040
 Okay.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:36.800
 Now, the seventh most valuable biscuit tin as far as we know.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:42.320
 And again, I'm afraid I have to say allegedly for this one, but allegedly, allegedly during

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.440
 the second world war, the crown jewels themselves were kept in a biscuit tin and berries.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.600
 They said it was got a kiss, got a kiss.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:54.160
 I was going to say, silly, no, it doesn't mean anything now that you've already seen it.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.160
 No, it's...

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.160
 In fact, I think it's pretty well sourced.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.040
 They were kept in a biscuit tin at Windsor Castle, and it was buried on Castle Grounds,

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.320
 and they were the most precious jewels from the Imperial State Crown, and they were

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.320
 in a tin, just in case.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.320
 Very nice.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.320
 There you go.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.360
 So, one came to steal some cookies, the cookie monster.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.360
 Oh, damn.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.360
 These are useless.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.360
 Okay.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:25.600
 It is time for fact number three, and oh, do you know it, it's a male again.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:34.760
 Well, my fact this week, guys, is that a man in New Zealand was reunited with his work

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.440
 swipe card, 21 years after losing it in Wellington.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:43.600
 It was found by researchers in Antarctica.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.280
 And that is a really long way.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.280
 That is a really long way.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.280
 Thousand miles?

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.280
 That's...

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:55.920
 You've come up with another game.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.520
 So, this story is...

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:06.000
 This is actually a music producer on it, RNZ, the public radio broadcaster.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.440
 In 2003, David McCaw lost his card, which gave him access to the Wellington Town Hall.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:18.440
 And he had his briefcase in his car, and someone saw it, broken, took the briefcase.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.920
 A few days later, the police found the briefcase.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:27.320
 It was sopping wet, and everything, there was a few things inside, but his work swipe card

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.560
 was missing from the briefcase.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:36.560
 And then fast forward to 2016, about 20 kilometres north of Scottbase in Antarctica, which is the

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:44.400
 New Zealand sort of research facility in Antarctica, Rod Bud was diving, and he found this

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.720
 swipe card under the ocean.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.280
 And thought, "Oh, that's interesting, that doesn't often see weird objects down there,"

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:55.640
 and so he took it, and saw that it said Radio New Zealand on it, so then figured it must

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.480
 be someone who's visited Scottbase, didn't think anything of it to sort of set it aside

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:05.160
 for eight years, and it wasn't until they were like, "Hold on, this guy, they got in touch

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.160
 with him, he's never been to Antarctica."

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.320
 That's when they went, "Oh, this is so strange."

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:17.720
 So question, could it have been that the person who broke into his car was a scientist?

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:22.800
 So there's some theories, they don't have a concrete answer, no one's come forward saying,

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:29.880
 "I'm the scientist who broke into his car," but it goes against the natural ocean currents,

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:35.200
 and less one theory is that it hitched it right on something buoyant, so it sort of followed

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:41.440
 the surface ocean currents that are a little bit more malleable, or someone who happened

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.840
 to visit Scottbase somehow had a swipe card.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:50.040
 I guess one more question, sorry done, did it still work?

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:55.080
 That's what I wanted to know as well, so I tend to email him, I'd be like, "Doesn't

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.080
 still work?"

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.080
 I don't think so.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.160
 I'd be waiting at the barriers for 21 years.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:06.440
 Honestly, I feel like I've been at work and I've left my job, and they've turned off my

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:10.480
 swipe card before I've even finished for the day, so.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:14.480
 I swear, I've been in hotels and they've made a swipe card, and by the time I got to my

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.480
 room it didn't work.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:21.280
 Right, yeah. Mell, you sent around a link about this story as a source of it, and it just

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.520
 has such a terrific opening line.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.040
 It kicks off, "You've heard of finding a needle in a haystack, but what about finding

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:32.120
 a swipe card in the vast expanse of the world's oceans?"

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.880
 What a good saying.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.880
 It's so true.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.120
 We'll probably never know, right?

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.920
 As in he said, he wants to know.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:44.520
 I don't think we'll live a no, but it's just one of those crazy coincidences.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:49.160
 We'll lose something in for it to come back into your life, but through very odd means.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.880
 Yeah, it would have been interesting for it to come through the currents, because like you

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.640
 say, Mell, I don't think that's kind of how the currents go around there.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.880
 In fact, there is one current that goes all the way around Antarctica.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.640
 That is the reason that you get penguins all over the continent, because penguins originally

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:10.760
 came from New Zealand, and then they kind of penguins really use the currents to swim,

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.600
 but they reckon that the reason you find them all over Antarctica is because they go in this

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.480
 sort of lazy river that goes all the way around the continent.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.920
 Once that you find like in the north, up near the Galapagos Islands, that's when the current

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.800
 has got a little bit slower and sort of flung them off to the north.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.040
 It is fascinating, isn't it?

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:34.800
 It's sort of nature's travelator where you can lose your energy levels, jump into that,

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.920
 and get there faster than if you were actually swimming, and dolphins will actually swim on

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.880
 the edge of currents when they just want that extra little bounce as they're going along.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.640
 The way scientists study them is also unbelievably interesting.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.880
 This one you're talking about, James, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the ACC.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.760
 I think it might be the largest current on Earth, and scientists want to know when it started,

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.880
 because it's incredibly useful for various things like climate science, and that one is

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.240
 so cool because it's like a buffer between the warmer waters to the north and the very cold

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.840
 Antarctic waters to the south.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.240
 It's like an elastic band all the way around, and scientists are trying to work out when

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:13.240
 it began, and so what they're using is fossilised fish teeth from 50 million years ago, because

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:19.280
 you can detect from fossilised teeth what the water column was like.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:25.040
 Was it Pacific or Antarctic water in that location at that time, because you can date the water

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.040
 and you can track the location.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.040
 It's so cool.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.040
 It's so cool.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.040
 It's so cool.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.040
 It's so cool.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.040
 It's so cool.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.040
 It's so cool.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.040
 It's so cool.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.040
 It's so cool.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.040
 It's so cool.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040
 I'm so happy.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040
 Let me know.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.040
 Let me know.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.040
 Let me know.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.040
 I can't believe I forgot.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.040
 Let me know.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.040
 I can't believe I forgot.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.040
 Let me know.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.040
 I can't believe I forgot.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040
 I can't believe I forgot.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.040
 Let me know.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.040
 Let me know.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.040
 Let me know.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.040
 Let me know.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.040
 Let me know.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.040
 Let me know.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.040
 Let me know.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.040
 Let me know.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.040
 I can't believe I forgot.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.040
 Let me know.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.040
 Let me know.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.040
 Let me know.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.040
 Let me know.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.040
 Let me know.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.040
 Let me know.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.040
 Let me know.

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.040
 I can't believe I forgot.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.040
 Let me know.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.040
 Let me know.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.040
 Let me know.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:17.040
 And probably they were attached to one stage and then when they opened up suddenly there was a chance for this current to go all the way around because all of the currents eventually they hit a bit of flan mass.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.040
 But this one doesn't, this one you can just once you get stuck in it you're there forever.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.040
 That's so interesting.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.040
 Have you guys talked about the Ivalor all before on the podcast?

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:34.040
 This is a cargo ship in 1992 that was containing bath toys that got into some stormy water.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:39.040
 Knocked over, knocked all of the containers into the ocean and these bath toys.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.040
 They've washed up all over the world and researchers have gone this is an amazing opportunity.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:53.040
 They've been able to track the ocean currents using these little rubber duckies because some would end up in England and some would end up in New Zealand and they would be able to chart.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:36:00.040
 They were like we wouldn't want to pollute the ocean on purpose but this is a happy thing to come out of this.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:10.040
 If you find one of those by the way, probably I would say according to my research the most expensive bath toys you can get.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:15.040
 So I wonder if anyone would like to guess.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.040
 James, don't do it.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.040
 200 quid for a duck.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:31.040
 5 million pounds.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.040
 That's pretty close I guess.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:50.040
 Now they kind of collect his items now there's like a few different people who collect them so when one comes on the market they all try and bid for it but quite often they find them and they're not the right ones because they all have special sort of barcodes on them so you know they're from this particular ship.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:55.040
 But of course if you get a little tie on a beach that could have come from anywhere right.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:04.040
 So every now and then you get new stories saying oh another one of these rubber ties has come up and then everyone gets really excited and it turns out it's just something someone's left at the beach.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:11.040
 I mean if I found out that people were paying a thousand quid for a rubber duck I would I would try quite hard to forge.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.040
 I'd flood eBay immediately.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:32.040
 But there's not that just that there was also 4.8 million Lego pieces that were dropped by another boat 34,000 hockey gloves that were dropped by another boat and thousands of Tommy Pickles cartoon heads that were dropped from another boat and they're all being sort of measured by these oceanographers.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:43.040
 This is too suspicious that these are all little floating things. I feel like scientists driving jet skis into cargo ships. Oh I guess we get some information.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:51.040
 Do you know my favorite currents are when they take people in boats and put them hundreds of miles away from where they're meant to be.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:38:02.040
 Those great those great stories you know when they survive their wonderful stories give us one that I'd not really aware of this is a Lenby Dells.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:12.040
 No you know you know two people were out at sea and a canoe and a current came and it took them and they were found hundreds of miles out drinking their own piss and so on all that stuff.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:27.040
 So you brought these facts to the table now. So 2011 two guys who were from the Pacific nation of Kiribats were out at sea.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:41.040
 They were ironically driving to get gas when they ran out of it and their GPS system was down and so they just floated off and they disappeared and they were out at sea for ages and ages until.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:58.040
 They eventually 600 kilometers from home rocked up against a little at all so they were safe they were able to get food and so on but one of the guys discovered his long lost uncle who who had been missing for 50 years.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:25.040
 Who had a lot of things to get stuck on in this fact but one that's throwing me is would you say it's ironic to run out of fuel when you're on your way to go get fuel I would say that's most likely time you would run out of fuel.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:31.040
 That's a good point so maybe it wasn't the fuel situation maybe the GPS went down and that they just so wandered off.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:38.040
 I'm sorry 50 years ago this guy's uncle clearly flees his old life and maybe some debts we don't know.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:44.040
 And then is in theory this good tin in a dream.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:52.040
 Because he must have felt absolutely busted when he saw his long lost nephew turning up floating slowly towards him saying Uncle Mike.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:40:05.040
 He's going to no hide hide hide hide behind that tree go to the other side of the at all the fuck sake.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:12.040
 Okay, here's one more quiz just because they've got all gone so well so far.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:20.040
 The fastest ocean current on earth is it faster or slower than the world's fastest running insect.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.040
 Oh gosh.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:31.040
 What's the fastest running insect is that's the Australian tiger beetle Andy as well you should know sorry.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:35.040
 And the fastest current is the Florida current which is the beginning of the Gulf Stream.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.040
 Okay.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.040
 I think the current is faster than the beetle.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.040
 Okay, Dan.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.040
 Beetle faster than the current.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.040
 Andy not got many options left.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.040
 I think they go at the same speed.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.040
 You're correct.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.040
 They both go at 5.6 miles per hour.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.040
 Oh you groups.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:41:02.040
 I knew if it's a hawking quiz there's a sting in the tail.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:09.040
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and oh guys.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:14.040
 What an admin cock up this is now somehow it is you again.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:18.040
 How okay I feel like I need to make it clear this is not my idea.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:37.040
 I'm not common during the podcast but my fact this week is that the Australian Bureau of Statistics have revealed that 3.14% of bakers are women living in South Australia which they released as a pie graph about people who make pies including the number pie.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:46.040
 And that's my fact. I'm leaving now. That's the best fact. That's the end of this podcast now. You can't beat that fact.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:53.040
 Is it 3.14% of Australian bakers are women in South Australia?

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.040
 Yes.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:00.040
 I think it's 3.14% of bakers are women living in South Australia.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.040
 It's got to be.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:08.040
 That's an enormous amount of bakers. Just in South Australia. It's not a huge place.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.040
 They must have really had to talk to the figures to get.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:16.040
 It feels very much like a hawking fact where they've got right. We need to get to 3.14%.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.040
 I think you might be right.

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.040
 How many decimal places did they do it to?

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:23.040
 Is it like pie and how many decimal places did they do it to?

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:31.040
 The number of bakers are South Australia women. This comes from the Australian Bureau of Statistics as I said.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:36.040
 They just released fun little graphs and I followed them on Facebook and I thought it looked fun.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.040
 That's my research guys. It's basically me.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:43.040
 But I love pie in all forms.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:47.040
 When I was at school, it was written on the walls all around my maths class.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:54.040
 And so I learnt 50 digits or so just from yeah, it was me and my friend would compete over how many we could 50 digits.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.040
 It's pretty impressive. That's a lot.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.040
 Can anyone beat that on this call? James, have you got a memory of pie?

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.040
 I could do probably five or six.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.040
 Right. Do you think so, Mel? Do you think you could still do the 50?

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:08.040
 I could, but I don't know if it's an impressive thing to do on a podcast.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.040
 We got time to fail.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.040
 I could close my eyes and do it.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:17.040
 Anything to stop Andy from another biscuit please.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:21.040
 I just want someone to randomly tune into this part of the podcast and be like, what is going on?

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.040
 Okay, you ready?

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.040
 Does anyone have pie up on screen? I mean, we can get it.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:30.040
 I've got it. I've got it here. I'll give you one three number, mouth three.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.040
 Oh crap. You've thrown me.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:39.040
 Okay, three point one four one five nine two six five three five eight nine seven nine three two three eight four six two six four three three eight three two

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:46.040
 seven nine five eight four one nine seven one six nine three nine three seven five one five eight two zero nine.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.040
 Fucking hell.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.040
 Thank you.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:55.040
 It sounds impressive, but if you think it's just like if you learned ten phone numbers, you can remember things.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.040
 That was insanely impressive.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:02.040
 I've got to say the number after the nine is a seven, so you should have rounded that up really.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.040
 Oh, sh*t, sh*t.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.040
 Okay, I'll think you've got 55.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.040
 Amazing.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.040
 Oh, man.

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.040
 You always want to undersell yourself.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.040
 You've out before.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:16.040
 It's not quite the world record, which is 70,000 dismal places.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.040
 Yeah.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.040
 That was a podcast.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.040
 I loved listening to that.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.040
 That was in India.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:26.040
 I love the people who learn pie to that number of decimal places.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.040
 Because I find that very interesting.

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:30.040
 So pie goes on forever.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:40.040
 It's been calculated to 106 trillion digits, but actually NASA only bothers with pie to 15 decimal places.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:45.040
 So all these people letting it to 70,000 places, NASA even don't bother with that.

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:50.040
 So I read a great piece by someone from the Jet Propulsion Lab at NASA, Mark Raymond.

00:44:50.040 --> 00:45:00.040
 He said, "Look, if you calculate Earth's circumference from pie to 15 decimal places, and then you use pie to hundreds of decimal places,

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:06.040
 the distance between your two calculations would be 130,000th the width of a human hair.

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:13.040
 So for all practical calculations, like if you're landing a rocket, you simply don't need pie to more than 15 decimal.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:16.040
 That is accurate in any real world calculation."

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.040
 Not every rocket launch is successful though.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:25.040
 Maybe Elon Musk is only using like three on his rocket launch.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.040
 So pie day is a very big thing.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:32.040
 I don't know if you celebrate it, Mel, but March 14th.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:38.040
 One of the people who were championed on that day is Albert Einstein, because he was born March 14th.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:47.040
 And so I looked to see if there are any other great mathematicians who were associated with pie day, went through a big old list, couldn't find any.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.040
 But, well, there's other people, but I hadn't heard of them.

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.040
 I was going for big, big time names, so I had to shift.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:46:01.040
 So other people born on pie day include Mrs. Beaton, who had a lot of pie recipes in her book.

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.040
 That's great. Very good.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:09.040
 And then the only other one who really caught my attention was Chris Klein, star of American pie.

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:13.040
 Oh my god, that's pretty good.

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:19.040
 Very good. We've known about pie since at least 1,550 BC.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:25.040
 There's a papyrus, called the Rhine papyrus, which was written by someone called Ahmos.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:32.040
 And it gives like a puzzle of calculating the size of a circle, if you know, like the size of a square around it.

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:39.040
 And it doesn't say, doesn't use the letter pie or anything like that, but it basically gives us the answer to the question.

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:45.040
 And they work out the pies around 3.16, which is not bad for 4,000 years ago.

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.040
 Should we say what pie is?

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:53.040
 Oh, yeah. It's the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.040
 So it's a constant, because that ratio is always the same.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:00.040
 So if you take any circle and you measure the distance all the way around it,

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:06.040
 and then you divide it by the longest line, you can draw in it, then you will get 3.1415, blah, blah, blah.

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:12.040
 And the way they calculated it back in the day was to, so this scribe put a circle in a square.

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:18.040
 And then our comedies improved on that. He put the circle in a hexagon, and then a smaller hexagon inside that.

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:25.040
 And you basically, the more sides on the shape that you're using in comparison with the circle, the more accurate.

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:35.040
 So there's a Persian mathematician called Jamshid Al-Kashi, who calculated by using a polygon of 800 million sides.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:41.040
 And he worked it out to 16 decimal places. I need the accuracy that NASA has today.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.040
 And he did that in the year 1424. Wow.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.040
 So he had NASA level accuracy back then. I just find that stunning.

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:56.040
 And there's a guy called Ludolf Van Kuhlen in 1594, and he used a polygon with 32 billion sides.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:05.040
 And published a value of Pi, which had 20 decimal places, and he was so proud of it. He had engraved on his tombstone.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:11.040
 What? And then 50 years after he died, Isaac Newton came up with a way of working it out.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:14.040
 He don't need to use polygons at all. So his was completely useless.

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.040
 Can we say who named it Pi, first of all?

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:21.040
 Because he's a really interesting mathematician. He's called William Jones.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:27.040
 He was a Welsh mathematician in the 18th century, born on a farm, received an incredibly basic education.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:34.040
 But he was a bit of a savant, and he was the first person who appreciated that Pi was irrational and non-repeating and infinite.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:42.040
 And he named it Pi after the Greek letter. And there's a theory that it was because of periphery.

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:46.040
 It's about the circumference of a circle, so periphery, Greek letter Pi.

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:54.040
 But Jones was, for a brief spell in the English Navy, apparently as a maths teacher on a warship.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.040
 And I can't find much more evidence about what he did.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.040
 Sure, he's time.

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.040
 Ballistics?

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.040
 Probably ballistics, that's great.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:10.040
 He also worked in cafes, like this was a thing in the 17th century. They were called known as Penny Universities.

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:19.040
 Basically, you go to Starbucks and there'd be a mathematician sitting in the corner and you'd pay him a penny and he would teach you some maths.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.040
 That's so cool.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:25.040
 That's a great idea. Do you know about his son? His son was, he was really interesting.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:32.040
 He was part of the popularisation of the language that's now known as proto-indo-European.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.040
 Or Pi.

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:45.040
 Isn't that cool? That's so cool. Yeah. Hey, check this out. I found out that there's a state, part of the Joe dynasty in China that was called Pi.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.040
 And they existed in the year 314.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.040
 No way.

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.040
 Yeah. That's amazing.

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:59.040
 It's very cool. Now Pi in Chinese, Pi, you've got two pronunciations. So I think this might be called P, like P double E.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:05.040
 And isn't that how we should be pronouncing Pi anyway? Wasn't that the Greek pronunciation?

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:08.040
 It might be. I think it would be. Yeah.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.040
 But that's not how we pronounce it.

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:20.040
 I'm now connecting the final dot to Mel's four facts that are all p-based that she has secretly snuck in.

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:25.040
 Have you guys ever heard of the language of Pi-lish?

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:31.040
 Yes. Mel's over there. This is such a... I'd never heard of this. This is such a cool way.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:37.040
 It's a part of a thing that's often known as constrained writing. So when writers apply rules to themselves.

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:45.040
 So for example, green eggs and ham, Dr. Seuss was told 50 of the most basic words for kids can only be used.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:49.040
 Or people have sometimes never used the letter E in an entire novel.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:59.040
 Pi-lish, this Pi language, is when you write a piece, but you have to match the letters of each word to where the next digit in Pi is.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:03.040
 So you start with "well" because that's three. Well, I.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:08.040
 That's four. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry. How are you selling well?

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:12.040
 Oh, I tried it all of a sudden.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:24.040
 It's out there. It doesn't even know Pi to one distance.

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:29.040
 I'll cover my eyes, so four points.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:34.040
 Yeah, no. So let's... I mean, we all know three letter words, right? I can't think of any right now.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.040
 I'm thinking of a few four letter words right now, though.

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:46.040
 Can I do another Pi mistake? Well, we're on that. So Kate Bush has a song called Pi.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:52.040
 And in it, she sings the number up to the 78th decimal place.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:59.040
 But then she misses out a load and then starts again on the 101st and finishes on the 137th.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:03.040
 And she also gets the 54th decimal wrong.

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:11.040
 And then BBC show more or less the radio show who does like math stuff. They came up with a thing called the Kate Bush Conjecture.

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:16.040
 Because Pi is an infinitely long number and we think that it doesn't repeat itself.

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:22.040
 And if it doesn't repeat itself, then that means that all series of numbers are in there somewhere.

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:29.040
 So maybe Kate Bush was not singing it from the start. She was actually singing it from 12 trillion.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:37.040
 And we just haven't got there yet. Right. Seems like a long way to go to exonerate Kate Bush.

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:43.040
 That's very fun. Kate Bush is also one of the books written by...

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.040
 Let me know.

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:56.040
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.

00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:00.040

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.040
 My Instagram's no such thing as James Harkin.

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:13.040
 And Mel.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.040
 I'm Melanie Bracewell.

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:20.040
 We know that, but what's your...

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:23.040
 Presumably on everywhere, right? Melanie Bracewell.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.040
 Yeah, mostly all Melodoodle.

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:30.040
 Anyway, you can also get through to us at podcast@ky.com. Send us emails there.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:36.040
 We do a great bonus episode as part of our club fish where we read out the best of your facts and your feedback.

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:40.040
 Just send them and he gets all those emails. Go to our website as well.

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:44.040
 No such thing as a fish.com. You can check out all our upcoming live shows.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:50.040
 Do come to those if you can. Otherwise, just come back here next week because we will be back with another episode.
