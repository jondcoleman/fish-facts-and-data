00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 Hello Clubfish members, welcome to this week's episode of Fish and a special top of show

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,200
 announcement just for you.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,520
 Now, first things first, let's get the guest out of the way.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,040
 Bit rude for me to say that, I suppose, considering it was the fantastic Melanie Bray's

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,040
 well.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,760
 Melanie's a really good friend of ours, we've known her for many, many years.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,640
 She's a regular on Australian television in New Zealand as well.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,520
 She's been on New Zealand Taskmaster.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,200
 She hosts a TV show called Cheap Seats Australia, but you've seen her on TV in the UK as well.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,080
 She's been on QI a couple of times, and she has very recently been on Richard Osmond's

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,600
 House of Games.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,400
 She's a brilliant stand-up comedian as well though, and so if you would like to see her

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,240
 on tour, great news.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:52,440
 She's coming to the UK and her tickets are available at MelanieBraySwell.com/taw.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,000
 So do get tickets for that, and, indeed, speaking of people who are going on tour, we are doing

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,680
 a live show very soon, and it is an unbelievably exciting one.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,140
 It is at the Royal Institution, no less.

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,000
 Can you believe they are letting us in to the venerable building to do a podcast.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,560
 It's just before Christmas, the 20th of December, there'll be a very, very special guest there

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
 on stage with us.

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,800
 However, it's going to be a whole load of Christmassy and Society fun, and so definitely

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
 come along to that.

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,520
 If you would like tickets for that, get in there fast because it's a pretty small venue,

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,280
 and we're not announcing it to the main feed for a little while.

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,040
 This is just for you, Club Fishers.

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,840
 If you go to nosichthingsandfish.com/ri, you'll be able to get details for that show.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,600
 Anyway, enough about the future.

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,960
 It's all about the present, and this week's show with MelanieBraySwell, so really help

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:02:02,360
 you enjoy it, and all that's left to say is on with the podcast!

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,520
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,240
 week coming to you from four undisclosed locations around the globe.

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,640
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,360
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, a special guest.

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,720
 It's MelanieBraySwell, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:30,080
 four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,320
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Mel.

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:39,480
 My fact this week is that a congested tunnel in Australia has installed moving lights

38
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,600
 that you race against, and it has helped reduce stop, start traffic by 70%.

39
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,960
 And I drive this tunnel frequently.

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,160
 Do you, and you've done the racing against the lights?

41
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,200
 Yeah, I mean, when I say race, I don't think that's what you're actually supposed to do.

42
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,080
 It's what I do, but it's essentially, it keeps pace with kind of the slowest traffic in

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
 the tunnel.

44
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,840
 Therefore, the pace is consistent, and people aren't driving super fast, and then stopping,

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,920
 and then driving, and then stopping, because that's what causes traffic.

46
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,760
 I had a look at it, and from the look of it, I mean, I haven't driven it obviously, but

47
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,080
 it looks like a ring of light around the edge of the tunnel, which sort of pulses through

48
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,720
 the tunnel, and you drive level with that ring.

49
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
 Is that right?

50
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
 As it moves.

51
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,160
 Yeah, so if you look in your lesson right, there's sort of these green lines that you are

52
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,040
 trying to keep pace with, and it feels really bad when one of the green lines overtakes

53
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
 you.

54
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,880
 Maybe it would have been better, like, it doesn't have to be lights, right?

55
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,800
 I thought about like a Pac-Man coming and trying to do something really good.

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
 Oh, yes.

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,200
 But once you see it in your review, hang on, you're the ghost.

58
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,080
 Yeah, you're the ghost in this situation.

59
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,440
 Well, maybe, wait a minute, you're the Pac-Man, and that's the ghost, the ghost is chasing

60
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
 it.

61
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,240
 It's too, we can't have a, like, you're the baddie in this situation.

62
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,960
 I caused a collision, but I didn't get a high score.

63
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,400
 Can you eat the strawberry turn around, and then you can drive backwards through the

64
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,920
 tunnel, that's right, yeah, yeah.

65
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,160
 So from the sound of it, the problem is that people drive downhill into the tunnel, they

66
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,920
 drive a longer tunnel, and then they drive up on the way out, but they slow down on the

67
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,280
 way up, because they don't really register that there's an uphill slope on the way out.

68
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,440
 So naturally, you just slow down, and that causes a ripple effect going all the way back

69
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,680
 through the tunnel, and then everyone slows down.

70
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,400
 Yeah, and so since this has been installed, there's been a 17% increase in speed.

71
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,680
 When there is traffic, it returns to the normal speed, 95% faster compared to before that

72
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
 installed.

73
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
 It's really good.

74
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,000
 They heard there's, like, a lot less breakdowns as well, because usually trucks are, like,

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,480
 stopping and starting with their brakes, but when they're not using their brakes as much,

76
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,000
 there's less things that can go wrong.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 So they're breaking up.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 I thought you meant emotional breakdowns, and that too.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,960
 Can I just quickly say, this is an absolute nightmare, though, for a super villain to hack,

80
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,440
 and then set the lights going to 200 miles an hour.

81
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,720
 Wow, that is a great, that is a great plot, any super villain's listening.

82
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,480
 But then the police can kind of slow them right down when they're doing the chase, can't

83
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
 they?

84
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
 Yes.

85
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
 I hadn't thought of that.

86
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,880
 James, let's talk scripts later, but I think we're all just up again.

87
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,800
 So this is a tunnel in Melbourne, and James, you just mentioned about trucks stopping

88
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
 and starting.

89
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,080
 Truck seemed to be a big problem for tunnels in Australia, generally, and there were

90
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,440
 a few management systems have been put in place to help them.

91
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,600
 So the Sydney Harbor Tunnel.

92
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,300
 They have a system in place for trucks that are constantly ignoring signs that say, your

93
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,400
 truck may be too high, stop if you are at this high, and they'll get to the entrances of

94
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
 this tunnel.

95
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,520
 They'll crash in, stuck, right?

96
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,960
 So this new system is in place there, a sheet like a waterfall will go over the front

97
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,440
 of the tunnel, and then they laser project a giant stop sign onto the waterfall.

98
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,800
 So it's literally in front of them, and you can't ignore it.

99
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
 You have to stop.

100
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,680
 Oh, it's like a log flume.

101
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
 I love that.

102
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,560
 You'd be like, ah, no, it's a truck.

103
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
 It's going to move at the last second.

104
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,200
 If I've seen any cartoons, and I have, I know I'll get through here.

105
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,640
 Are you saying that that exists, Stan, Sydney?

106
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,000
 In the Sydney Harbor Tunnel, and quite a few other tunnels.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Yeah.

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,600
 So it literally has an emergency moment.

109
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
 Oh, man.

110
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,640
 You want to see it though, but the only way to do it is that you have a truck too high.

111
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,560
 Honestly, next time we're in Australia, I have hired in a truck, and I have fly

112
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
 in towards that tunnel.

113
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
 Yeah.

114
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
 I'm very tall.

115
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,080
 I should just get like, just stand on top of a car and make it happen.

116
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,960
 So do you ever drive around in Queensland, Mel?

117
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
 Not often.

118
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
 Okay.

119
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
 Okay.

120
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
 Okay.

121
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
 It's a big country, Andy.

122
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
 No further questions.

123
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,280
 Well, it's not where I live, so if I was to go to Queensland, I'd be more likely to order

124
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
 a can.

125
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
 Okay.

126
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
 So you don't do interstate trucking in Queensland.

127
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
 There's what I'm doing.

128
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,280
 Not so much these days.

129
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,720
 That is shame because if you do, the highways are basically a large, slow pub quiz.

130
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,680
 So Queensland is seven times as high as the UK, just for context.

131
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,840
 And you know, you get people driving, do you get the road trains?

132
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
 Do you get those in Queensland?

133
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
 I think you might do.

134
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
 Anyway.

135
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
 What?

136
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
 I'm sorry, Andy.

137
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
 Andy, Andy.

138
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
 It's a road track.

139
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
 Yeah.

140
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
 You just put two words together that don't really fit together.

141
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,320
 It's like a convoy of trucks.

142
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,280
 And you, you know, it's halfway between just normal logistics and Mad Max, because you're driving

143
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,000
 across Australia with a load of trucks and it's a road train.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,800
 Anyway, if you're a trucker in Australia, in a road train or out, it's obviously really

145
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,400
 boring and there are long stretches of just nothing for ages and ages and ages.

146
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,800
 And so you have to keep drivers engaged.

147
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,200
 And so Queensland's authorities have put a pub quiz basically on the signs around

148
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
 the state.

149
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,320
 So you will see a sign saying, which animal is the fastest on earth?

150
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,120
 And then like five miles later, you'll see a sign saying, it's the Paragram Falcon when

151
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
 it's diving.

152
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,960
 Is it, it counts as on earth if it's diving?

153
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
 It's a good point.

154
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
 No, you're right, James.

155
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
 I mean, Quibble, do right in, too.

156
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
 Okay.

157
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,320
 Well, the next sign says, no, no, we do realise that it's not actually on the earth.

158
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
 No, okay.

159
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:09,240
 Let's have another couple just to see if you're as smart as a road train captain.

160
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,560
 What is the coldest town in Queensland?

161
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,040
 It'll be like Wollongong or something like somewhere south.

162
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
 Well, no.

163
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
 Is it right?

164
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
 No.

165
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
 Oh, of course.

166
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
 This is around the world.

167
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,000
 It'll be screaming, screaming at their phones.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Okay.

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,400
 And the last one, when is rabbit breeding season?

170
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,800
 Oh, it's, that's all the time in Australia, isn't it?

171
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
 Oh, yeah.

172
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 Correct.

173
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
 Oh, yeah.

174
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
 Trick question.

175
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,880
 I'd be so pissed off after five miles if I heard, kind of by a trick question.

176
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
 Beautiful.

177
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
 Yeah.

178
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,520
 It's, um, the roads in Australia are pretty mental.

179
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,720
 The, um, the longest road in the world is the one that goes round Australia.

180
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
 Highway one.

181
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
 Oh.

182
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,360
 It's 9,000 miles long.

183
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,400
 And if instead of putting it all the way around Australia, they decided to go from Perth

184
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,440
 outwards, they could have got all the way to London.

185
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
 Stop it.

186
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
 Whoa.

187
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
 That's, why didn't they?

188
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,960
 They should remember that.

189
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
 Fools.

190
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,680
 The flights are so tedious.

191
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,040
 I could just have 15,000 pub trivia questions.

192
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,680
 I, it would be done in no time.

193
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,360
 No, the scale is mad, isn't it?

194
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
 It is.

195
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,080
 Because if you, if you break down as well in 2017, there was a tradesman who crashed his car

196
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,440
 out in the outback on one of these roads.

197
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,920
 And the closest help he could get was I believe 150 kilometers away, which he had to walk.

198
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
 So he did.

199
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
 Yeah.

200
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,480
 So he did this walk, survived initially on water, had to start drinking his own urine, um,

201
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,160
 and finally got found after he'd walked about 100 or 120 kilometers.

202
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,720
 So he only had like 30 to go before he could have rocked up to this town going.

203
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
 You won't believe what I did.

204
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
 Please.

205
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
 I'm so thirsty.

206
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,040
 Can a, can a very oversized truck go through this tunnel?

207
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
 Right?

208
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,680
 Have you, so, Mel, have you heard of the outback way?

209
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,720
 Because I don't know if this is the road you're talking about just there, Dan.

210
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,200
 So this is, it's a series of roads and it runs from the middle of Western Australia to

211
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
 the middle of Queensland.

212
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,360
 So that is over two and a half thousand kilometers, it's really long.

213
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,480
 Um, I think much of it is not paved and a lot of it you need permission to go over, um,

214
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,680
 and some bits are just for remote indigenous communities.

215
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,760
 And it's known as the world's longest shortcut because it does technically shave time off

216
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,800
 your roof, if you are as opposed to going up and then right around highway one that James

217
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
 was talking about.

218
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,080
 But it was made by this guy called Len Bidell.

219
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
 Is he a house or daim in Australia, Mel?

220
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
 Oh, Len Bidell.

221
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
 He started a limb.

222
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
 Okay.

223
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
 Oh, man.

224
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,440
 Did he win, uh, dancing with his stars this year?

225
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
 Oh, man.

226
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
 Okay.

227
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
 Okay.

228
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,200
 So it's not a house or a name, but he's just an amazing guy.

229
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,560
 So he, he wrote a lot of books about his time.

230
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,480
 He just made roads all his life and his books include beating about the bush too long in

231
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,200
 the bush, still in the bush, blast the bush and bush bashers.

232
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,560
 And um, he named them all after members of his family.

233
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
 So there's the Gary highway.

234
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,040
 There's the conny suit highway.

235
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,720
 The bugs were named after the members of his family.

236
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,800
 This one's after my daughter Bush, Bidell, um, but the amazing thing about him was he was

237
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,440
 also a bush dentist, right?

238
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,240
 So he knew that he was going to be out with a road building crew for ages.

239
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,200
 So he took a course in tooth extraction in case anyone got a toothache, you know, because

240
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,400
 obviously you're hundreds of miles from the nearest dentist.

241
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,000
 So by the time that he and his crew had finished the gun barrel highway, which was his first

242
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,960
 really long road, uh, he'd taken 29 teeth from his crew.

243
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
 Wow.

244
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
 That's stunning.

245
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
 Wow.

246
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
 Those can't all have been necessary.

247
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
 Yeah.

248
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
 I think he's gone.

249
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
 I've got the qualification.

250
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
 I'll be stupid if I don't use them.

251
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,320
 I had a fact for James actually on this one.

252
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,880
 So there's a road in Australia, which James would probably find so attractive.

253
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,480
 Any pictures from the other two as to why?

254
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,520
 Oh, because you can play.

255
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
 It's got golf holes.

256
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
 Oh.

257
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
 It's gone way through.

258
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
 I mean.

259
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
 Am I that one?

260
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
 I bet you still has a character.

261
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
 Sorry, James.

262
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
 I'm so sorry, James.

263
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,360
 But the, is it pronounced Nalaba?

264
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
 No.

265
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
 Nalaba plain.

266
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
 Nalaba links.

267
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
 And you're right.

268
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
 No, it James.

269
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,160
 Nalaba means no trees, right?

270
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
 It does.

271
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
 It does.

272
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
 It's also a good place to play golf.

273
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
 Oh.

274
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
 There's no trees.

275
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
 But also Andy.

276
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
 Yeah.

277
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,560
 Mal is a New Zealander who's just emigrated to Australia.

278
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
 Give her a break.

279
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
 You know.

280
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
 I don't know.

281
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,560
 What's the warmest town in Western Australia now?

282
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,640
 What is the name of Len Bdell's upcoming book?

283
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
 Because we all know it.

284
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
 I'm so sorry about it.

285
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
 You're right.

286
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
 You're right.

287
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
 You're right.

288
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,680
 That famous bush-debtist we all talk about.

289
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,200
 So the Nalaba links is the world's longest golf course.

290
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,280
 It's 850 miles long.

291
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
 Oh.

292
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,040
 Is it like 18 holes or is it?

293
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,640
 I believe it's still 18 holes, but they are spread out.

294
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
 Oh, I see.

295
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,320
 So you play one hole and then you drive 100 miles to the next one.

296
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,120
 You can walk, but you're going to need to drink a lot of your own wee on the way.

297
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,360
 You played golf with me before.

298
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:13,400
 Do you guys know who doesn't have issues with traffic?

299
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
 Oh.

300
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
 And.

301
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
 Have you guys talked about this before?

302
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:22,400
 There's a study that they did in 2019 looking at the way that ants move because they do follow

303
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,800
 sort of roads leading from food back to their colonies because they lead these sort of chemical

304
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,520
 trails and they found that even with a lot of congestion, the ants never had any trouble

305
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,880
 with traffic or build up.

306
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,920
 And I love the way that they did this study, which is they made tiny little bridges for

307
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:47,240
 ants and increased the width of the bridge or narrowed the width of the bridge and found

308
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,600
 that they would find alternative routes or they would kind of move in this kind of constant

309
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,360
 state of travel and they had no traffic issues.

310
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,840
 And that means the problem with traffic is just us.

311
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:04,440
 If we all just drove at a constant speed and had an eye out for each other, then we'd all

312
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,440
 be better off.

313
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,600
 That's really wise, Mel.

314
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,040
 And I think actually what I try and say sometimes is I don't say I'm sorry I'm late.

315
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,440
 I was in traffic.

316
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,040
 I say I'm sorry I'm late.

317
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
 I was traffic.

318
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
 Wow.

319
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
 You know what I mean?

320
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
 It's so beautiful.

321
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
 Yeah.

322
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,320
 He's really cool to work with Mel.

323
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,360
 That's a shame you don't get to experience these day to day, absolute zingers when he walks

324
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
 in.

325
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:35,760
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

326
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,760
 And well, actually, because she sent in so many great facts, we're going to go and give

327
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
 her another fact.

328
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,960
 First time we've ever done this.

329
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
 Oh my gosh.

330
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,960
 It's time for fact number two.

331
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
 And that is Mel.

332
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
 Wow.

333
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
 Oh my gosh.

334
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
 I'm flattered.

335
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,480
 The fact this week is New Zealand decides new laws to debate and Parliament by pulling them

336
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,560
 at random out of a 30-year-old biscuit tin.

337
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,600
 So that's amazing.

338
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
 Yeah.

339
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,080
 It's true love that.

340
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,520
 What I thought when I heard this a while ago was that they pulled the actual bills out,

341
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,400
 but they have numbered tokens, numbered one through 90.

342
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,880
 And they are assigned to a specific, a specific bill.

343
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,600
 Very important bills were pulled from this.

344
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,760
 Game average was pulled from this.

345
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
 Really?

346
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
 Euthanasia was pulled from this.

347
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,760
 It's surreal.

348
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,440
 There's a lot of significant stuff in this biscuit tin.

349
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
 I know.

350
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
 Exactly.

351
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,760
 Probably the theory that no biscuit tin contains biscuits.

352
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,640
 It's like sewing supplies or laws.

353
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,640
 You know?

354
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
 Yummy biscuit.

355
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
 I know.

356
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,040
 It's the water care amendment bill.

357
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,920
 New Zealand is often a socially progressive country and a few things have passed there ahead

358
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,120
 of the world.

359
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,120
 And it sounds like it was because of the biscuit tin and having this system, these things might

360
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,760
 not otherwise have come up.

361
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,520
 It's not every law.

362
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,240
 It's not, it's basically ones that are presented by maybe some minor parties that don't have

363
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
 the floor.

364
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
 I see.

365
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
 It would be insane.

366
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,680
 It would be insane to have every law, like just incredibly aside from the biscuit tin.

367
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,360
 Oh, murder's legal in New Zealand because it hasn't come out of the biscuit tin yet.

368
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
 Sorry.

369
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
 That's what the lucky dip says.

370
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
 Murderousness.

371
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,320
 There's some stuff lurking in there.

372
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,520
 So I think it's, I think that's right.

373
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,920
 It's called a members bill.

374
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
 I know.

375
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,560
 I think Britain has an equivalent in, we have one in our parliament.

376
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,560
 A private members bill is the British equivalent.

377
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,960
 So if it's not part of the agenda, but you're passionate about it and it's a cause that

378
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
 you believe in.

379
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,640
 One thing that's interesting, I think, is that in the past, obviously this biscuit tin

380
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,440
 has only existed for 30 years or had this role for 30 years.

381
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
 It might pre-existed.

382
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
 I don't know.

383
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,280
 Before that, you would have a bit of time when you can have these special members bills

384
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:52,400
 and to decide which laws you would debate, you would basically have to get to the clerk first.

385
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,560
 So they would say, okay, Thursday we've got a bit of time, we're going to do this and

386
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,360
 everyone would leg it to the clerk saying, I want my Lauren, I want my Lauren, or they

387
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,040
 would even queue up overnight, like they were trying to get tickets for Wimbledon or something

388
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,640
 just so that they could get their law debated.

389
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,560
 Because would they ever, would the, did you say it was the clerk you needed to find?

390
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
 Yeah, that's right.

391
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,760
 Would he, or should he ever hide and it's kind of, if you find the clerk?

392
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,200
 There's a thing in the UK here that I'm sure James, you and Andy will know about, but the

393
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,320
 division bell for UK Parliament, which is also to do with voting.

394
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,280
 So if a vote needs to happen and there's a division, this bell goes off, which gives

395
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,320
 MPs eight minutes to get there to register their vote.

396
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,680
 But because people are so spread out, division bells are all over Westminster.

397
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,640
 So some local pubs will have division bells, or there will be a direct phone call to a

398
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,640
 landlord to ring a particular bell, or it'll be in cafes and so everywhere.

399
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,520
 So you'll be sitting maybe in a pub, a lot of MPs having a pint of beer, this bell goes

400
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,920
 off and they'll just bolt out of there to get back to vote.

401
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
 Is that still true, Andy?

402
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,960
 I thought they might have changed the pub one a few years ago.

403
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
 I don't know.

404
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
 I think the red line is a pub.

405
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
 Yeah, yeah.

406
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
 I don't know if it's still there.

407
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,480
 The plan was to start phasing it out of pubs in 2021, but I think yeah, there's possible

408
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,120
 that there might be a few, but there's 384 division bells, let's say, before the phase

409
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
 out.

410
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
 Yeah.

411
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
 This is having a bat signal.

412
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
 Basically, it's what it is, isn't it?

413
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,080
 Like it's just, but you need to just need to go vote on a lot.

414
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
 Like it's an unsexy bat signal.

415
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
 But it is cool.

416
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
 Yeah.

417
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,520
 On pubs and Parliament, New Zealand Parliament has a pub now.

418
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
 It did have a pub.

419
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
 It was closed down.

420
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
 The pub is reopened.

421
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,920
 It's called pint of order, and I think it's great.

422
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:45,840
 And on the wall of the pub is the first sort of, they say proper bill to be passed by a newly

423
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,160
 independent Parliament, so not under the colonial governorship.

424
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,840
 And it was for allowing Parliament to circumvent the liquor laws.

425
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,440
 That was the first thing we wanted to do.

426
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,240
 That was the first pint of order.

427
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,880
 Yeah, put that bill in the biscuit tin at 90 times.

428
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,720
 So we've just talked about the French Parliament.

429
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
 That is shaped.

430
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,360
 So the British Parliament is two benches, and the one side is on the left and one side is

431
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,000
 on the right, and they argue.

432
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,440
 I can't remember what the New Zealand one is, but the French one is like a semicircle.

433
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,360
 And the reason it is that is it's based on the School of Surgery in Paris.

434
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,240
 It was a place where you would cut up bodies, and everyone had to have a good view of you

435
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,640
 cutting up the bodies.

436
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,880
 And then they chose the Parliament to be based on that, which I think is really cool.

437
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,640
 And there is one country in the world that has their Parliament in the shape of an Athletic

438
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
 Stadium.

439
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,640
 Can you guess which it is?

440
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
 Yes, yes.

441
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
 Yes, yes.

442
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
 Is this an especially athletic country?

443
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
 Maybe.

444
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,640
 You've got a guess.

445
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,520
 Okay, so a load of Olympic long distance runners are from Kenya, aren't they?

446
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
 So I'm going to say Kenya.

447
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
 But they don't.

448
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,320
 Is it somewhere in like South America or something?

449
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,180
 You have loads of them, but like long distance runners often aren't in the stadium.

450
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,840
 They're running like marathon running, or 10k is outside the stadium.

451
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
 That's a really important thing.

452
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
 Okay.

453
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,840
 So who runs in a stadium?

454
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
 It's just sprinters.

455
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,840
 Keep going.

456
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
 Do you say in bold?

457
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
 Yeah, who is from?

458
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
 Jamaica.

459
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
 Jamaica?

460
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
 Well done.

461
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
 Yes.

462
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,840
 Oh.

463
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
 On the shoulders of giants.

464
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,000
 I was using a tailwind, yeah.

465
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,080
 So Jamaica, I've got an Athletic Stadium shaped Parliament.

466
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
 That's great.

467
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
 Wow.

468
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,080
 Does it?

469
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,560
 When you say Athletic Stadium shaped, is there a bit in the middle where you get to

470
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,880
 throw the tablet?

471
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
 What?

472
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
 Yeah.

473
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
 What does that mean?

474
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,800
 It's just because there are nine countries in the world with circular chambers.

475
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
 There's quite a lot of them.

476
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,840
 We've got hemispheres like France and like the European Parliament.

477
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,440
 A lot of got the same as the British Parliament.

478
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,960
 But theirs is kind of an elongated circle.

479
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
 That's great.

480
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
 Right.

481
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
 That's really good.

482
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,200
 There's a thing that happened in Australia a number of years ago, about 20 years ago now,

483
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,920
 which is that the Parliament banned all the security staff from saying, "Good, I mate."

484
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,360
 When people walked in, they were like, "Mate, mate is not a word that we want to be encouraging

485
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,840
 when George Bush is walking through our doors."

486
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,600
 And then Prime Minister John Howard would often call Bush mate.

487
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,320
 It was just, we don't like this word.

488
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,880
 So security staff were told, "You can't do it anymore."

489
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,960
 And the ban lasted less than 24 hours because Australians said, "No way, mate."

490
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,280
 It was just like, "Are you kidding?

491
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,000
 That's a national pride that greeting and that word."

492
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,360
 Well, New Zealand has a list of words that they've deemed unparliamentary.

493
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,120
 So these are words that are insulting or unbecoming and had to be retracted.

494
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,840
 In 1949, the phrase, "His brains could revolve inside a pen-ut shell for a thousand years without touching the sides."

495
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,400
 Had to be retracted, it was deemed unparliamentary.

496
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,680
 "Energy of a tired snail returning home from a funeral."

497
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,280
 That was 1963, that was deemed unparliamentary.

498
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,920
 And this phrase, I feel like I just want to say it on my day today.

499
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,520
 This is 1946.

500
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,520
 "Idle vaporings of a mind diseased."

501
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,920
 Oh, my goodness.

502
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,800
 So mysterious.

503
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
 Sick bird.

504
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,720
 I found a great little nugget, which is that our UK Parliament, they have their own internal library.

505
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,360
 Back in 2013, they looked into the list of the most borrowed books from this library.

506
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,120
 The number one most borrowed book from Parliament's library was a book called "How to Be an MP."

507
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
 For dummies?

508
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
 Yeah, exactly.

509
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:41,280
 It was a self-help book and it had like, amazing chapters called, you know, "How to dilute boredom.

510
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,000
 How to write an abusive letter."

511
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:52,420
 Yeah, how to convince voters that MPs never stop working.

512
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,920
 How to climb the greasy pole.

513
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
 Things like that.

514
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,860
 Previously, for five years, there was another book that was the number one most borrowed

515
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,860
 book.

516
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,000
 And that was called, sorry.

517
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,240
 "How to borrow a book."

518
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,600
 Yeah, that one was called "How Parliament Works."

519
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,760
 That was the previous, yeah, most borrowed book.

520
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,120
 Speaking of libraries, actually, the New Zealand Parliament has a library.

521
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,640
 And in 1968, there was a big storm that hit Wellington, who's a really famous one, some

522
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,800
 boats capsized and stuff, so it was really, really bad.

523
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,340
 But the water from the storm surge started going towards the Parliament and the people

524
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,200
 working there thought we need to get the books out of here.

525
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,400
 So they took all the books and they took them onto the roof to keep them away from the water.

526
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,080
 And this is according to a tour guide, whom does a tour of the New Zealand Parliament.

527
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:53,680
 And they say, "For mysterious and unknown reasons, they did this in their underwear."

528
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:59,920
 And I can't work out why if you're going to take books out of a library and put them

529
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
 on a roof, you would do it in your underwear.

530
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,440
 No one explained why, no one says there's no written record of her.

531
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,800
 There had been a big storm, but it was a storm surge, which can come after the rain, so

532
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,200
 I don't know if it was raining or not.

533
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,560
 I think that makes sense, because you don't want to get your clothes, if the storm surge

534
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:21,640
 arrives and you're in your heavy, heavy cotton ruffles or your wool, then it's good you're

535
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,560
 going to get seriously weighed down.

536
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
 That's true.

537
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,160
 So they took the books on the roof, you say?

538
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,080
 On the roof, yeah, which suggests that it might not have been raining at that point.

539
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,160
 Yeah, okay, yeah, okay, right, right, right.

540
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,200
 And also Andy, whenever it rains, do you just get completely naked?

541
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,600
 Not completely, but I think it's good.

542
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,400
 Sometimes if you've got a job to do in the rain, it's actually better to have fewer clothes

543
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
 on.

544
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,800
 It's like how if you're dealing with a pest or an invasive animal in your home, like a mouse

545
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,760
 or whatever, you don't want to get it.

546
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
 You don't want to get it.

547
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
 You don't want to get it out.

548
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
 Of course.

549
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,720
 Can I please finish?

550
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,800
 I don't want that mouse crawling up my trouser leg.

551
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,720
 I'd rather see it on my leg.

552
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,560
 Do you know what I'm saying?

553
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,560
 No, not really.

554
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
 I know, but keep going.

555
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
 Keep going.

556
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,960
 Look, it's more upsetting to have a ferret in your trouser leg than it is to have a ferret

557
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
 on your bare leg.

558
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
 That's all I'm saying.

559
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:21,440
 This is why you were kicked out of that petting zoo.

560
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,840
 I've just got one thing about biscuit tins.

561
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
 Oh, yeah.

562
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,160
 I think I found the third most valuable biscuit tin ever, which I know, the sold in 2019,

563
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,440
 it was from about 1910, beautiful biscuit tin, shaped like a bus, lovely.

564
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,440
 Any guesses as to how much it went forward auction?

565
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,600
 Is there any reason why it was particularly expensive, just a nice and historic thing?

566
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
 Just nice.

567
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,560
 I don't think it wasn't a celebrity one, it wasn't historical.

568
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
 200 quid?

569
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
 3,100.

570
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,680
 Oh, thank God you didn't ask me for mine.

571
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
 I was cool.

572
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
 I was cool.

573
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,680
 Really overshoot it.

574
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,880
 Well, Dan, do you want to have another crack at the value of the second most valuable biscuit

575
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,880
 tin ever?

576
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
 1.5 mil.

577
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
 Great.

578
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,880
 Thanks, Dan.

579
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,640
 Thanks a bunch for absolutely torpedoing my fun game.

580
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,240
 Mel, would you like to guess, maybe a sensible guess, as the value of the second most expensive

581
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,960
 biscuit tin that I've been able to find?

582
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,720
 Let's say 800.

583
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
 Thank you.

584
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
 Thanks.

585
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
 How much was the first one?

586
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
 It was 3,100.

587
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,200
 So, Mel, you have low ball bit rather given that this is more valuable than that.

588
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
 We know that.

589
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
 It's quite reasonable.

590
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
 Less valuable.

591
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,200
 No, this is the second.

592
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200
 That was the third most valuable.

593
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
 This is the second most.

594
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
 We're going uphill for some jeopardy, Mel.

595
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:41,000
 Actually, I did not say the currency, but it doesn't help, but I didn't say the currency.

596
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 I was saying.

597
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 I was saying Bitcoin.

598
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 I said yes.

599
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 You know, I'm a Bitcoin, exactly.

600
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Okay.

601
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,200
 I got for one bit, coin, but how much do they worth, that 80 grand loads?

602
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
 This is more.

603
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
 Oh, thankfully.

604
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,560
 No, this was an island of man-man who was caught with 150 grams worth of heroin in a biscuit

605
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,560
 tin.

606
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,920
 I can't wait a minute, I don't need.

607
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,520
 How much of that value is the biscuit tin without the tin, it's worth nothing.

608
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,480
 So, you're on a, what I did was I paid 150 grand for a biscuit tin.

609
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,720
 I didn't know what was going to be in there.

610
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,160
 And then the most valuable biscuit tin ever, that I've been able to find.

611
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,160
 Okay.

612
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:26,000
 So, inside it was Hitler's apology for the second world war.

613
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,880
 You're so close.

614
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,960
 There is a second world war link.

615
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
 You're so close.

616
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,440
 Wait, so is British tin?

617
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,000
 Is the tin the valuable item here or is the item inside it?

618
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,080
 I think we've worked out that the tin is irrelevant to the recall price of it.

619
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,080
 Okay.

620
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,760
 I'll go 1.5, Mel.

621
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,280
 This is a really interesting episode of antics roadshow.

622
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,280
 I love it.

623
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,800
 1.5, Mel, let's go to Mel.

624
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,920
 Dan, would you like to completely nuke the game again by guessing like 300 billion quid

625
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
 or something?

626
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
 No.

627
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
 17 million.

628
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
 Do you know what?

629
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
 I think it might be more than that.

630
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
 What?

631
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
 I think that's priceless.

632
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
 Oh.

633
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,920
 Okay.

634
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
 In the second world war.

635
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,600
 So, I wouldn't have been nuking the game, it would have been pretty accurate.

636
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,600
 I think that's what we've worked out.

637
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,040
 Why haven't I been asked to quiz, and please, no one ever let Andy write the quiz questions

638
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,800
 for those long roads in Australia, because I swear to God, I'd be crashing my car and drinking

639
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,880
 my piss before I needed to see another question.

640
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,040
 You're like, you've done the first one.

641
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
 Okay.

642
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:36,800
 Now, the seventh most valuable biscuit tin as far as we know.

643
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,320
 And again, I'm afraid I have to say allegedly for this one, but allegedly, allegedly during

644
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,440
 the second world war, the crown jewels themselves were kept in a biscuit tin and berries.

645
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,600
 They said it was got a kiss, got a kiss.

646
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,160
 I was going to say, silly, no, it doesn't mean anything now that you've already seen it.

647
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
 No, it's...

648
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
 In fact, I think it's pretty well sourced.

649
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,040
 They were kept in a biscuit tin at Windsor Castle, and it was buried on Castle Grounds,

650
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,320
 and they were the most precious jewels from the Imperial State Crown, and they were

651
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
 in a tin, just in case.

652
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,320
 Very nice.

653
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,320
 There you go.

654
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,360
 So, one came to steal some cookies, the cookie monster.

655
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
 Oh, damn.

656
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,360
 These are useless.

657
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,360
 Okay.

658
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:25,600
 It is time for fact number three, and oh, do you know it, it's a male again.

659
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:34,760
 Well, my fact this week, guys, is that a man in New Zealand was reunited with his work

660
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,440
 swipe card, 21 years after losing it in Wellington.

661
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,600
 It was found by researchers in Antarctica.

662
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,280
 And that is a really long way.

663
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
 That is a really long way.

664
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,280
 Thousand miles?

665
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,280
 That's...

666
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:55,920
 You've come up with another game.

667
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,520
 So, this story is...

668
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:06,000
 This is actually a music producer on it, RNZ, the public radio broadcaster.

669
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,440
 In 2003, David McCaw lost his card, which gave him access to the Wellington Town Hall.

670
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:18,440
 And he had his briefcase in his car, and someone saw it, broken, took the briefcase.

671
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,920
 A few days later, the police found the briefcase.

672
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:27,320
 It was sopping wet, and everything, there was a few things inside, but his work swipe card

673
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,560
 was missing from the briefcase.

674
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:36,560
 And then fast forward to 2016, about 20 kilometres north of Scottbase in Antarctica, which is the

675
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:44,400
 New Zealand sort of research facility in Antarctica, Rod Bud was diving, and he found this

676
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,720
 swipe card under the ocean.

677
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,280
 And thought, "Oh, that's interesting, that doesn't often see weird objects down there,"

678
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,640
 and so he took it, and saw that it said Radio New Zealand on it, so then figured it must

679
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,480
 be someone who's visited Scottbase, didn't think anything of it to sort of set it aside

680
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:05,160
 for eight years, and it wasn't until they were like, "Hold on, this guy, they got in touch

681
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
 with him, he's never been to Antarctica."

682
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,320
 That's when they went, "Oh, this is so strange."

683
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:17,720
 So question, could it have been that the person who broke into his car was a scientist?

684
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,800
 So there's some theories, they don't have a concrete answer, no one's come forward saying,

685
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:29,880
 "I'm the scientist who broke into his car," but it goes against the natural ocean currents,

686
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,200
 and less one theory is that it hitched it right on something buoyant, so it sort of followed

687
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,440
 the surface ocean currents that are a little bit more malleable, or someone who happened

688
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,840
 to visit Scottbase somehow had a swipe card.

689
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,040
 I guess one more question, sorry done, did it still work?

690
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:55,080
 That's what I wanted to know as well, so I tend to email him, I'd be like, "Doesn't

691
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
 still work?"

692
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
 I don't think so.

693
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,160
 I'd be waiting at the barriers for 21 years.

694
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:06,440
 Honestly, I feel like I've been at work and I've left my job, and they've turned off my

695
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,480
 swipe card before I've even finished for the day, so.

696
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,480
 I swear, I've been in hotels and they've made a swipe card, and by the time I got to my

697
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
 room it didn't work.

698
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,280
 Right, yeah. Mell, you sent around a link about this story as a source of it, and it just

699
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,520
 has such a terrific opening line.

700
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,040
 It kicks off, "You've heard of finding a needle in a haystack, but what about finding

701
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,120
 a swipe card in the vast expanse of the world's oceans?"

702
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,880
 What a good saying.

703
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,880
 It's so true.

704
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,120
 We'll probably never know, right?

705
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,920
 As in he said, he wants to know.

706
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:44,520
 I don't think we'll live a no, but it's just one of those crazy coincidences.

707
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,160
 We'll lose something in for it to come back into your life, but through very odd means.

708
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,880
 Yeah, it would have been interesting for it to come through the currents, because like you

709
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,640
 say, Mell, I don't think that's kind of how the currents go around there.

710
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,880
 In fact, there is one current that goes all the way around Antarctica.

711
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,640
 That is the reason that you get penguins all over the continent, because penguins originally

712
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,760
 came from New Zealand, and then they kind of penguins really use the currents to swim,

713
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,600
 but they reckon that the reason you find them all over Antarctica is because they go in this

714
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,480
 sort of lazy river that goes all the way around the continent.

715
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,920
 Once that you find like in the north, up near the Galapagos Islands, that's when the current

716
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,800
 has got a little bit slower and sort of flung them off to the north.

717
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,040
 It is fascinating, isn't it?

718
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:34,800
 It's sort of nature's travelator where you can lose your energy levels, jump into that,

719
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,920
 and get there faster than if you were actually swimming, and dolphins will actually swim on

720
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,880
 the edge of currents when they just want that extra little bounce as they're going along.

721
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,640
 The way scientists study them is also unbelievably interesting.

722
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,880
 This one you're talking about, James, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the ACC.

723
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,760
 I think it might be the largest current on Earth, and scientists want to know when it started,

724
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,880
 because it's incredibly useful for various things like climate science, and that one is

725
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,240
 so cool because it's like a buffer between the warmer waters to the north and the very cold

726
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,840
 Antarctic waters to the south.

727
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,240
 It's like an elastic band all the way around, and scientists are trying to work out when

728
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:13,240
 it began, and so what they're using is fossilised fish teeth from 50 million years ago, because

729
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:19,280
 you can detect from fossilised teeth what the water column was like.

730
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,040
 Was it Pacific or Antarctic water in that location at that time, because you can date the water

731
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
 and you can track the location.

732
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,040
 It's so cool.

733
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
 It's so cool.

734
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
 It's so cool.

735
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
 It's so cool.

736
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
 It's so cool.

737
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
 It's so cool.

738
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
 It's so cool.

739
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
 It's so cool.

740
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
 It's so cool.

741
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
 I'm so happy.

742
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
 Let me know.

743
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
 Let me know.

744
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
 Let me know.

745
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
 I can't believe I forgot.

746
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,040
 Let me know.

747
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
 I can't believe I forgot.

748
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
 Let me know.

749
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
 I can't believe I forgot.

750
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
 I can't believe I forgot.

751
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
 Let me know.

752
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
 Let me know.

753
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
 Let me know.

754
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,040
 Let me know.

755
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
 Let me know.

756
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
 Let me know.

757
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,040
 Let me know.

758
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
 Let me know.

759
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,040
 I can't believe I forgot.

760
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
 Let me know.

761
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
 Let me know.

762
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
 Let me know.

763
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,040
 Let me know.

764
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
 Let me know.

765
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
 Let me know.

766
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
 Let me know.

767
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,040
 I can't believe I forgot.

768
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,040
 Let me know.

769
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
 Let me know.

770
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,040
 Let me know.

771
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:17,040
 And probably they were attached to one stage and then when they opened up suddenly there was a chance for this current to go all the way around because all of the currents eventually they hit a bit of flan mass.

772
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,040
 But this one doesn't, this one you can just once you get stuck in it you're there forever.

773
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
 That's so interesting.

774
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,040
 Have you guys talked about the Ivalor all before on the podcast?

775
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:34,040
 This is a cargo ship in 1992 that was containing bath toys that got into some stormy water.

776
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,040
 Knocked over, knocked all of the containers into the ocean and these bath toys.

777
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,040
 They've washed up all over the world and researchers have gone this is an amazing opportunity.

778
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:53,040
 They've been able to track the ocean currents using these little rubber duckies because some would end up in England and some would end up in New Zealand and they would be able to chart.

779
00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:00,040
 They were like we wouldn't want to pollute the ocean on purpose but this is a happy thing to come out of this.

780
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:10,040
 If you find one of those by the way, probably I would say according to my research the most expensive bath toys you can get.

781
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:15,040
 So I wonder if anyone would like to guess.

782
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,040
 James, don't do it.

783
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,040
 200 quid for a duck.

784
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:31,040
 5 million pounds.

785
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,040
 That's pretty close I guess.

786
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:50,040
 Now they kind of collect his items now there's like a few different people who collect them so when one comes on the market they all try and bid for it but quite often they find them and they're not the right ones because they all have special sort of barcodes on them so you know they're from this particular ship.

787
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:55,040
 But of course if you get a little tie on a beach that could have come from anywhere right.

788
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:04,040
 So every now and then you get new stories saying oh another one of these rubber ties has come up and then everyone gets really excited and it turns out it's just something someone's left at the beach.

789
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:11,040
 I mean if I found out that people were paying a thousand quid for a rubber duck I would I would try quite hard to forge.

790
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,040
 I'd flood eBay immediately.

791
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:32,040
 But there's not that just that there was also 4.8 million Lego pieces that were dropped by another boat 34,000 hockey gloves that were dropped by another boat and thousands of Tommy Pickles cartoon heads that were dropped from another boat and they're all being sort of measured by these oceanographers.

792
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:43,040
 This is too suspicious that these are all little floating things. I feel like scientists driving jet skis into cargo ships. Oh I guess we get some information.

793
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:51,040
 Do you know my favorite currents are when they take people in boats and put them hundreds of miles away from where they're meant to be.

794
00:37:51,040 --> 00:38:02,040
 Those great those great stories you know when they survive their wonderful stories give us one that I'd not really aware of this is a Lenby Dells.

795
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:12,040
 No you know you know two people were out at sea and a canoe and a current came and it took them and they were found hundreds of miles out drinking their own piss and so on all that stuff.

796
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:27,040
 So you brought these facts to the table now. So 2011 two guys who were from the Pacific nation of Kiribats were out at sea.

797
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:41,040
 They were ironically driving to get gas when they ran out of it and their GPS system was down and so they just floated off and they disappeared and they were out at sea for ages and ages until.

798
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:58,040
 They eventually 600 kilometers from home rocked up against a little at all so they were safe they were able to get food and so on but one of the guys discovered his long lost uncle who who had been missing for 50 years.

799
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:25,040
 Who had a lot of things to get stuck on in this fact but one that's throwing me is would you say it's ironic to run out of fuel when you're on your way to go get fuel I would say that's most likely time you would run out of fuel.

800
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:31,040
 That's a good point so maybe it wasn't the fuel situation maybe the GPS went down and that they just so wandered off.

801
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:38,040
 I'm sorry 50 years ago this guy's uncle clearly flees his old life and maybe some debts we don't know.

802
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:44,040
 And then is in theory this good tin in a dream.

803
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:52,040
 Because he must have felt absolutely busted when he saw his long lost nephew turning up floating slowly towards him saying Uncle Mike.

804
00:39:52,040 --> 00:40:05,040
 He's going to no hide hide hide hide behind that tree go to the other side of the at all the fuck sake.

805
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:12,040
 Okay, here's one more quiz just because they've got all gone so well so far.

806
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:20,040
 The fastest ocean current on earth is it faster or slower than the world's fastest running insect.

807
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,040
 Oh gosh.

808
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:31,040
 What's the fastest running insect is that's the Australian tiger beetle Andy as well you should know sorry.

809
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,040
 And the fastest current is the Florida current which is the beginning of the Gulf Stream.

810
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
 Okay.

811
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,040
 I think the current is faster than the beetle.

812
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,040
 Okay, Dan.

813
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,040
 Beetle faster than the current.

814
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
 Andy not got many options left.

815
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
 I think they go at the same speed.

816
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,040
 You're correct.

817
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,040
 They both go at 5.6 miles per hour.

818
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
 Oh you groups.

819
00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:02,040
 I knew if it's a hawking quiz there's a sting in the tail.

820
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:09,040
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and oh guys.

821
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,040
 What an admin cock up this is now somehow it is you again.

822
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,040
 How okay I feel like I need to make it clear this is not my idea.

823
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:37,040
 I'm not common during the podcast but my fact this week is that the Australian Bureau of Statistics have revealed that 3.14% of bakers are women living in South Australia which they released as a pie graph about people who make pies including the number pie.

824
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:46,040
 And that's my fact. I'm leaving now. That's the best fact. That's the end of this podcast now. You can't beat that fact.

825
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:53,040
 Is it 3.14% of Australian bakers are women in South Australia?

826
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,040
 Yes.

827
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,040
 I think it's 3.14% of bakers are women living in South Australia.

828
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,040
 It's got to be.

829
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:08,040
 That's an enormous amount of bakers. Just in South Australia. It's not a huge place.

830
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,040
 They must have really had to talk to the figures to get.

831
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:16,040
 It feels very much like a hawking fact where they've got right. We need to get to 3.14%.

832
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,040
 I think you might be right.

833
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,040
 How many decimal places did they do it to?

834
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,040
 Is it like pie and how many decimal places did they do it to?

835
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:31,040
 The number of bakers are South Australia women. This comes from the Australian Bureau of Statistics as I said.

836
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,040
 They just released fun little graphs and I followed them on Facebook and I thought it looked fun.

837
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,040
 That's my research guys. It's basically me.

838
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,040
 But I love pie in all forms.

839
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,040
 When I was at school, it was written on the walls all around my maths class.

840
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:54,040
 And so I learnt 50 digits or so just from yeah, it was me and my friend would compete over how many we could 50 digits.

841
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,040
 It's pretty impressive. That's a lot.

842
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,040
 Can anyone beat that on this call? James, have you got a memory of pie?

843
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,040
 I could do probably five or six.

844
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,040
 Right. Do you think so, Mel? Do you think you could still do the 50?

845
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,040
 I could, but I don't know if it's an impressive thing to do on a podcast.

846
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,040
 We got time to fail.

847
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,040
 I could close my eyes and do it.

848
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,040
 Anything to stop Andy from another biscuit please.

849
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,040
 I just want someone to randomly tune into this part of the podcast and be like, what is going on?

850
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,040
 Okay, you ready?

851
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,040
 Does anyone have pie up on screen? I mean, we can get it.

852
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,040
 I've got it. I've got it here. I'll give you one three number, mouth three.

853
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,040
 Oh crap. You've thrown me.

854
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:39,040
 Okay, three point one four one five nine two six five three five eight nine seven nine three two three eight four six two six four three three eight three two

855
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:46,040
 seven nine five eight four one nine seven one six nine three nine three seven five one five eight two zero nine.

856
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,040
 Fucking hell.

857
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,040
 Thank you.

858
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,040
 It sounds impressive, but if you think it's just like if you learned ten phone numbers, you can remember things.

859
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
 That was insanely impressive.

860
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,040
 I've got to say the number after the nine is a seven, so you should have rounded that up really.

861
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,040
 Oh, sh*t, sh*t.

862
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,040
 Okay, I'll think you've got 55.

863
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,040
 Amazing.

864
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,040
 Oh, yeah.

865
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,040
 Oh, man.

866
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,040
 You always want to undersell yourself.

867
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,040
 You've out before.

868
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,040
 It's not quite the world record, which is 70,000 dismal places.

869
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,040
 Yeah.

870
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,040
 That was a podcast.

871
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,040
 I loved listening to that.

872
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,040
 That was in India.

873
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,040
 I love the people who learn pie to that number of decimal places.

874
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,040
 Because I find that very interesting.

875
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,040
 So pie goes on forever.

876
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:40,040
 It's been calculated to 106 trillion digits, but actually NASA only bothers with pie to 15 decimal places.

877
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:45,040
 So all these people letting it to 70,000 places, NASA even don't bother with that.

878
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:50,040
 So I read a great piece by someone from the Jet Propulsion Lab at NASA, Mark Raymond.

879
00:44:50,040 --> 00:45:00,040
 He said, "Look, if you calculate Earth's circumference from pie to 15 decimal places, and then you use pie to hundreds of decimal places,

880
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:06,040
 the distance between your two calculations would be 130,000th the width of a human hair.

881
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:13,040
 So for all practical calculations, like if you're landing a rocket, you simply don't need pie to more than 15 decimal.

882
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,040
 That is accurate in any real world calculation."

883
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,040
 Not every rocket launch is successful though.

884
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:25,040
 Maybe Elon Musk is only using like three on his rocket launch.

885
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,040
 So pie day is a very big thing.

886
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,040
 I don't know if you celebrate it, Mel, but March 14th.

887
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:38,040
 One of the people who were championed on that day is Albert Einstein, because he was born March 14th.

888
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:47,040
 And so I looked to see if there are any other great mathematicians who were associated with pie day, went through a big old list, couldn't find any.

889
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,040
 But, well, there's other people, but I hadn't heard of them.

890
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,040
 I was going for big, big time names, so I had to shift.

891
00:45:54,040 --> 00:46:01,040
 So other people born on pie day include Mrs. Beaton, who had a lot of pie recipes in her book.

892
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,040
 That's great. Very good.

893
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:09,040
 And then the only other one who really caught my attention was Chris Klein, star of American pie.

894
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,040
 Oh my god, that's pretty good.

895
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:19,040
 Very good. We've known about pie since at least 1,550 BC.

896
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:25,040
 There's a papyrus, called the Rhine papyrus, which was written by someone called Ahmos.

897
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:32,040
 And it gives like a puzzle of calculating the size of a circle, if you know, like the size of a square around it.

898
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:39,040
 And it doesn't say, doesn't use the letter pie or anything like that, but it basically gives us the answer to the question.

899
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:45,040
 And they work out the pies around 3.16, which is not bad for 4,000 years ago.

900
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,040
 Should we say what pie is?

901
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:53,040
 Oh, yeah. It's the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle.

902
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,040
 So it's a constant, because that ratio is always the same.

903
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,040
 So if you take any circle and you measure the distance all the way around it,

904
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:06,040
 and then you divide it by the longest line, you can draw in it, then you will get 3.1415, blah, blah, blah.

905
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:12,040
 And the way they calculated it back in the day was to, so this scribe put a circle in a square.

906
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:18,040
 And then our comedies improved on that. He put the circle in a hexagon, and then a smaller hexagon inside that.

907
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:25,040
 And you basically, the more sides on the shape that you're using in comparison with the circle, the more accurate.

908
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:35,040
 So there's a Persian mathematician called Jamshid Al-Kashi, who calculated by using a polygon of 800 million sides.

909
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:41,040
 And he worked it out to 16 decimal places. I need the accuracy that NASA has today.

910
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,040
 And he did that in the year 1424. Wow.

911
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,040
 So he had NASA level accuracy back then. I just find that stunning.

912
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:56,040
 And there's a guy called Ludolf Van Kuhlen in 1594, and he used a polygon with 32 billion sides.

913
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:05,040
 And published a value of Pi, which had 20 decimal places, and he was so proud of it. He had engraved on his tombstone.

914
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:11,040
 What? And then 50 years after he died, Isaac Newton came up with a way of working it out.

915
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,040
 He don't need to use polygons at all. So his was completely useless.

916
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,040
 Can we say who named it Pi, first of all?

917
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,040
 Because he's a really interesting mathematician. He's called William Jones.

918
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:27,040
 He was a Welsh mathematician in the 18th century, born on a farm, received an incredibly basic education.

919
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:34,040
 But he was a bit of a savant, and he was the first person who appreciated that Pi was irrational and non-repeating and infinite.

920
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:42,040
 And he named it Pi after the Greek letter. And there's a theory that it was because of periphery.

921
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,040
 It's about the circumference of a circle, so periphery, Greek letter Pi.

922
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:54,040
 But Jones was, for a brief spell in the English Navy, apparently as a maths teacher on a warship.

923
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,040
 And I can't find much more evidence about what he did.

924
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,040
 Sure, he's time.

925
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,040
 Ballistics?

926
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,040
 Probably ballistics, that's great.

927
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:10,040
 He also worked in cafes, like this was a thing in the 17th century. They were called known as Penny Universities.

928
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:19,040
 Basically, you go to Starbucks and there'd be a mathematician sitting in the corner and you'd pay him a penny and he would teach you some maths.

929
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,040
 That's so cool.

930
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:25,040
 That's a great idea. Do you know about his son? His son was, he was really interesting.

931
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:32,040
 He was part of the popularisation of the language that's now known as proto-indo-European.

932
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,040
 Or Pi.

933
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:45,040
 Isn't that cool? That's so cool. Yeah. Hey, check this out. I found out that there's a state, part of the Joe dynasty in China that was called Pi.

934
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,040
 And they existed in the year 314.

935
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,040
 No way.

936
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,040
 Yeah. That's amazing.

937
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:59,040
 It's very cool. Now Pi in Chinese, Pi, you've got two pronunciations. So I think this might be called P, like P double E.

938
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:05,040
 And isn't that how we should be pronouncing Pi anyway? Wasn't that the Greek pronunciation?

939
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,040
 It might be. I think it would be. Yeah.

940
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,040
 But that's not how we pronounce it.

941
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:20,040
 I'm now connecting the final dot to Mel's four facts that are all p-based that she has secretly snuck in.

942
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:25,040
 Have you guys ever heard of the language of Pi-lish?

943
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:31,040
 Yes. Mel's over there. This is such a... I'd never heard of this. This is such a cool way.

944
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:37,040
 It's a part of a thing that's often known as constrained writing. So when writers apply rules to themselves.

945
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:45,040
 So for example, green eggs and ham, Dr. Seuss was told 50 of the most basic words for kids can only be used.

946
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,040
 Or people have sometimes never used the letter E in an entire novel.

947
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:59,040
 Pi-lish, this Pi language, is when you write a piece, but you have to match the letters of each word to where the next digit in Pi is.

948
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,040
 So you start with "well" because that's three. Well, I.

949
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,040
 That's four. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry. How are you selling well?

950
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:12,040
 Oh, I tried it all of a sudden.

951
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:24,040
 It's out there. It doesn't even know Pi to one distance.

952
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:29,040
 I'll cover my eyes, so four points.

953
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,040
 Yeah, no. So let's... I mean, we all know three letter words, right? I can't think of any right now.

954
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:38,040
 I'm thinking of a few four letter words right now, though.

955
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:46,040
 Can I do another Pi mistake? Well, we're on that. So Kate Bush has a song called Pi.

956
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:52,040
 And in it, she sings the number up to the 78th decimal place.

957
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:59,040
 But then she misses out a load and then starts again on the 101st and finishes on the 137th.

958
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,040
 And she also gets the 54th decimal wrong.

959
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:11,040
 And then BBC show more or less the radio show who does like math stuff. They came up with a thing called the Kate Bush Conjecture.

960
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,040
 Because Pi is an infinitely long number and we think that it doesn't repeat itself.

961
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:22,040
 And if it doesn't repeat itself, then that means that all series of numbers are in there somewhere.

962
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:29,040
 So maybe Kate Bush was not singing it from the start. She was actually singing it from 12 trillion.

963
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:37,040
 And we just haven't got there yet. Right. Seems like a long way to go to exonerate Kate Bush.

964
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:43,040
 That's very fun. Kate Bush is also one of the books written by...

965
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,040
 Let me know.

966
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:56,040
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.
