1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,760
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,520
 and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,020
 this week coming to you live from Dublin.

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,020
 (audience cheering)

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,760
 My name is Dan Shriver.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,340
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,320
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,520
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,960
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,280
 And in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,100
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,960
 My fact this week is that there is a town in Russia

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,120
 that hosts an annual festival to celebrate mosquitoes.

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,000
 The main event is the most delicious competition

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,280
 in which girls compete to see how many times

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,920
 they can get bitten by a mosquito

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,620
 after standing around for 20 minutes.

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,080
 (audience laughing)

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
 Now I should say it's not one mosquito

21
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,560
 that's doing the biting.

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,560
 - In actual fact, sometimes it's no mosquitoes.

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,320
 So in 2014, this was the second version of this festival.

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,920
 They did it next to the city pond,

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,980
 but it was so cold that all the mosquitoes had died.

26
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,240
 (audience laughing)

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,000
 And so it was a no scar draw in the end.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,440
 Everyone got no bites.

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,400
 - Oh, well there you go.

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,240
 - Can you lure mosquitoes to you?

31
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,880
 - No, there are kind of strict rules about this.

32
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,520
 So this is in Berezniki, which is in the Ural Mountains.

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,720
 This is in Russia.

34
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,840
 And you would send out these girls with their parents

35
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,280
 into a forest, and they would go picking berries.

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,680
 - It's just sort of a Grimm's fairy tale.

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,640
 (audience laughing)

38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,960
 - I think, so the idea is that they just pick berries,

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,160
 and it's very kind of, yes, dark, but.

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,040
 - Wait, do the girls know they're in this competition?

41
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
 - Yes, they do.

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,280
 - I assume they must do, yeah.

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,560
 And so they spend 20 minutes or so in there,

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,800
 and then they come back out,

45
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,520
 and then they all have to stand on a stage,

46
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,640
 and a panel of judges, including a doctor,

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,720
 comes in in specs, where all the bite locations are,

48
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,040
 and the one with the most bites wins.

49
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,320
 And so the reason I think that this got a bit big

50
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,680
 was because there was a report in 2013, I believe,

51
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,760
 it was where they announced Irina was the winner that year.

52
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,360
 She had 43 bites.

53
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,800
 And, you know, remember 2013 was the year of Zika?

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,600
 You know, they were sort of saying,

55
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,920
 "Oh, this is a bit bold, isn't it?"

56
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,440
 Having, sending a child.

57
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,680
 But obviously they don't have Zika there, or at least.

58
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,800
 - But well done to the person who just booed Zika.

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,160
 I think we all can agree with that sentiment.

60
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,080
 - Your liberal credentials are impeccable, yeah.

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,760
 - That was actually in 2016,

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,040
 the one where Irina Ilyukhina won.

63
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,240
 - Oh, sorry, yes.

64
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,560
 - She got 43 bites.

65
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,320
 The next year in 2017, the winner got more than 150 bites.

66
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,160
 - Wow.

67
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,920
 - She was nine years old.

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
 - What?

69
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,560
 Her social service has been informed about this.

70
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,280
 - Well, according to the local newspaper in Russia,

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
 they said that the nine-year-old winner

72
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,440
 did not even move her eyes,

73
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,320
 'cause she wanted to not just have the most bites,

74
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,640
 but also be the most patient.

75
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
 - Oh, isn't that cute?

76
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,480
 - Are you all right?

77
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,680
 - No, there's no prize for that, is there?

78
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,520
 Jesus.

79
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,040
 And what's with the berry picking?

80
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,560
 It seems like it's just an excuse

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,560
 to get small children to harvest berries for free.

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,720
 And then you lure them in with the temptation of getting--

83
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,800
 - With the promise of repeatedly being bitten.

84
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,640
 - Exactly.

85
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,480
 - But it's a three-day festival.

86
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,760
 They all know why they're there.

87
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,600
 There's lots of different things.

88
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,720
 - What, there are more events?

89
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
 - There's more events, yeah.

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,640
 You've got other events

91
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,720
 that include most horrible mosquito squeak contest.

92
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,080
 I actually don't know how a mosquito squeaks,

93
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,920
 I've just realized.

94
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,760
 - Very, very high-pitched.

95
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,120
 So you almost can't hear it.

96
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,960
 You have heard it.

97
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,800
 They go...

98
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,840
 - Dude, I always thought that was the wings.

99
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,320
 That's them, them, just going...

100
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,560
 - Oh, that is the wings.

101
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,160
 - Oh, it is the wings, okay.

102
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,400
 - They squeak with their wings.

103
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,160
 - I'm not just going around going...

104
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,480
 That's what I thought.

105
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,000
 - And they have a few more things they have.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,320
 They have Mosquito Legs competition

107
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,640
 to see who has the legs most like a mosquito.

108
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,600
 - Okay.

109
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,640
 - I don't think that means having six of them.

110
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,480
 - Spindly.

111
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,320
 - Spindly, yeah.

112
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,640
 It's like knobbly knees.

113
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,360
 They have a comedy song competition

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,240
 where you have to make a comedy song about mosquitoes.

115
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
 And they have a thing called Games of Winners,

116
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,240
 which are sports competitions for children

117
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,040
 who've overcome serious illnesses.

118
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,880
 - Right.

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,560
 - Very serious and noble last one

120
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,320
 on top of two ridiculous contests.

121
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,360
 I should have finished with the funny ones, shouldn't I?

122
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,400
 - Apparently Mosquito Legs is just a thing.

123
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,480
 So they have other competitions like this around the world.

124
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,200
 In Texas, they have a similar Mosquito Festival in Clute.

125
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,760
 And they have a Mosquito Legs competition as well,

126
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,360
 separate for children and adults.

127
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,240
 And the organizers are called the SWAT team.

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
 - Very good.

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,520
 - Well, yeah.

130
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,680
 Other weird festivals, you know.

131
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,920
 There's a vaguely similar festival,

132
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,880
 the Bee Wearing Festival in the Hunan Province in China.

133
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,280
 A festival where you wear bees,

134
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,400
 which is, I would say--

135
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,120
 - What do you mean by wearing bees?

136
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,160
 - Unlike having a bee beard, we talked about that one.

137
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
 - Exactly.

138
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,080
 And you do it by hanging the queen bee

139
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,560
 next to your face, basically.

140
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,640
 - Oh, that's what it is. - Another little bee cage.

141
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,200
 Yeah, and so they have a festival

142
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,480
 to see who can wear the most bees.

143
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,600
 It's pretty impressive.

144
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,720
 And the winner was Wang Dalin of the most recent one.

145
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,640
 He got 27 kilos of bees to sit on his body.

146
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,000
 - What was the seven kilos of bees?

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,880
 - Sorry, sorry, can I just stop you as well?

148
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,400
 Wang Dalink, did you say that?

149
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,600
 - Yeah.

150
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,040
 - Dalink, it doesn't feel like a very--

151
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,880
 - Darlink.

152
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,720
 - It's not Wang Dalink.

153
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,640
 It's not related to the Darlink family of Peter Pan,

154
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,480
 I don't think.

155
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,360
 - Darlink.

156
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,200
 - Darlink.

157
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,040
 - I got it, sorry. - Sorry, Darlink.

158
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,520
 Anyway, he got 27 kilos of bees to sit on him.

159
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,400
 - Sorry, I just love that there's people in China going,

160
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,560
 "All right, Darlink."

161
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,760
 (laughing)

162
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,600
 - All right, Darlink, how are you doing?

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,720
 Anyway, you're only allowed to wear shorts

164
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,840
 and the rest of your naked, except for some goggles

165
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,560
 and plugs up the nose.

166
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,760
 So that's permitted.

167
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,520
 - So are they not worried about any of the other orifices,

168
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,840
 like ears, I'm thinking, like an ice?

169
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,120
 - I think we've mentioned before the most painful place

170
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
 to get stung is inside your nose, right?

171
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,800
 So maybe you're only allowed, maybe you're given one plug.

172
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,520
 They say, you know, you put this where you choose.

173
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,360
 - Yeah.

174
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,200
 (laughing)

175
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,320
 It's a one nostril, I mean.

176
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,400
 - One nostril, save one nostril.

177
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,600
 - Right, wow.

178
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,680
 What an interesting concept.

179
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,120
 I wonder at what point when you're wearing so many bees

180
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,280
 that you keel over, that you're weighed down.

181
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,040
 - 'Cause 20 kilos is pretty heavy, it's like--

182
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,120
 - Yeah, yeah.

183
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,080
 - Yeah, I guess that, I mean, they are sort of flying.

184
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,360
 I'm not sure the extent to which they are sustaining--

185
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,200
 - Keep themselves up.

186
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,200
 - Opposite question, then, at what point do you levitate

187
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,200
 when you have that many bees?

188
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,120
 - Maybe that's what they're trying to do.

189
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,480
 - There's a festival in Portugal

190
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,440
 in a town called Amarante, which I really like,

191
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,480
 and it's a romantic festival,

192
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,280
 and it all centers around unmarried young people

193
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,440
 exchanging phallic cakes.

194
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,480
 And it's a really charming thing.

195
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,720
 The whole town gets involved.

196
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
 You know, these grandmothers will be selling

197
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,840
 these massive Willy cakes stuffed with cream as well.

198
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,400
 It's all really suggestive.

199
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,040
 And they were, this festival is a very,

200
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,920
 it's quite an old one, but it was banned

201
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,640
 under the days of the dictatorship in Portugal.

202
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,280
 And the cakes were kind of driven underground.

203
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,680
 But they were, I think they were secretly traded.

204
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,360
 And then in 1974, they had a revolution,

205
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,400
 and then they were liberated from not being able to--

206
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,280
 - When they were driven underground,

207
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,640
 was it like the Reformation?

208
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,240
 Did you have sort of priest holes,

209
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,120
 like cake holes where you retreat in your house

210
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,840
 and you do a little cake sermon, do we know,

211
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,200
 or did it just disappear?

212
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,040
 - I don't know.

213
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,400
 Maybe it hasn't been written down

214
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,880
 because it's two secrets still.

215
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,560
 But they are sold year round now.

216
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,720
 So it's kind of been untethered from their original--

217
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,560
 - Really?

218
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,160
 So in Portugal, you can get,

219
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,240
 instead of hot cross buns, you get penises?

220
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,080
 No.

221
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,920
 - Well, you can get,

222
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,480
 as in you used to only be able to get a Willy cake

223
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,240
 at the right time of year, like a hot cross bun,

224
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,000
 but now, in an arguable step forwards,

225
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,960
 you can get a hot cross bun or a penis cake all the time.

226
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,920
 It's good.

227
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,040
 - I like the idea of a phallus untethered from its origin.

228
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,000
 - I think if you--

229
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,960
 - If you attach enough bees to it.

230
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,120
 - I was reading about a festival

231
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,880
 which happened in Mexico.

232
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,400
 It's called San Juan de la Vega,

233
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,000
 and it's been going for 300 years,

234
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,200
 and this is a festival where locals will attach

235
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,800
 a homemade explosive to the head of their sledgehammer,

236
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,880
 and then they will wap it into the road

237
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,320
 and let it explode in front of them,

238
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,960
 and people watch that,

239
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,600
 and the article I read said,

240
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,720
 'cause there's so many people saying,

241
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,920
 "Do you think we should stop the explosives

242
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,800
 "on the sledgehammer slamming to the road?

243
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,840
 "Bit of the festival?"

244
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,960
 And they say, "Absolutely not, 300 years."

245
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,240
 And then the same article from 2020,

246
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,440
 they said, "43 people were injured this year."

247
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,280
 - Wow.

248
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,760
 So it's got a high every year.

249
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,040
 - High injury rate, yeah.

250
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,320
 - Is that in honor of something?

251
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,920
 Did some saint explode?

252
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,960
 - Yeah, it was.

253
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,800
 No, no, it was.

254
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,000
 There was someone who was supposedly

255
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,160
 the Robin Hood of this area.

256
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,680
 In fact, the town is named after this person.

257
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,200
 I don't think they exploded.

258
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,120
 I should have read it, really, the article further.

259
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,040
 - No, no, the mystery is better.

260
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,960
 How far do you think you could throw an uncooked sausage?

261
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,240
 - Ah.

262
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,280
 - Straight from the freezer, or is it?

263
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,320
 - No, I think it's malleable, so it's been defrosted,

264
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,680
 but it is wrapped in plastic, so you've got, you know.

265
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,800
 - So is it different to a cooked sausage?

266
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,640
 - Yes.

267
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,480
 - Yes, okay.

268
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,760
 It's someone in the audience.

269
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,240
 Someone in the audience leapt right in there.

270
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,840
 - The voice of experience feels like

271
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,200
 it's speaking from the audience.

272
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,080
 - I reckon I could throw one into the circle from here.

273
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,400
 - All right.

274
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,480
 - Do it, do it, do it!

275
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
 Let's all get the sausage we keep on our pockets out.

276
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,440
 Everyone, what do you think?

277
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,920
 We're just carrying raw sausages around with us.

278
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,120
 - I reckon around 40 yards.

279
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,960
 - 40 yards.

280
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,800
 - Do what am I--

281
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,440
 - 120 feet, pretty good.

282
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,120
 - I am 20, it's 17 meters.

283
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,040
 Sorry, I don't know why I'm giving such a thought

284
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,840
 through the answer.

285
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,320
 - Yards and answering meters.

286
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,200
 Dan, do you want to throw in furlongs, maybe?

287
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,040
 - Yeah, yeah.

288
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,680
 - Let's all make us nice and comparable.

289
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,920
 - 20 leagues.

290
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,120
 (laughing)

291
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,720
 - Well, I'll tell you, the record

292
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,080
 for throwing a standard raw

293
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,880
 at the Harwich Essex Sausage Festival

294
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,160
 is 171 feet, which I think is very good.

295
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,000
 - What did I say I could do?

296
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,720
 - You said 120 feet, not bad.

297
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,560
 - Wow.

298
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,880
 - That's held by a man called Todd Rothwell,

299
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,160
 just to give him his due.

300
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,480
 And that was apparently thrown under perfect conditions.

301
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,320
 There was--

302
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
 (laughing)

303
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,960
 - Was the wit like, wind assisted?

304
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,200
 - I don't know about prevailing wind,

305
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,240
 but the previous record was about 140 feet,

306
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,400
 and that was held for years and years,

307
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,640
 and then he smashed through it.

308
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,600
 And they take it very seriously,

309
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,720
 obviously not very seriously,

310
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,040
 'cause it's not a very serious thing to do,

311
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,240
 but it's judged by a proper cricket umpire

312
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,800
 to prevent any foul play.

313
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,640
 - Okay.

314
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
 - And there are sausage marshals

315
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,960
 who stand along, you know, sausage alley

316
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,320
 and observe the throws.

317
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,720
 - Oh, okay, to look for the throw itself.

318
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,560
 - You wouldn't, it's like,

319
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,960
 to stop people walking up to a sausage

320
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,800
 and then just kicking it another few--

321
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,680
 - I just don't see how, if you're a cricket umpire,

322
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,480
 that job sort of transfers.

323
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,960
 I don't see what's special about it,

324
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,760
 unless there's loads of cheating Australians in this spot.

325
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,920
 - I don't--

326
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,560
 - What, ow.

327
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,280
 - If you rub some sandpaper on the skin of the sausage,

328
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,120
 it will light.

329
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,440
 - Nice.

330
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,560
 Guys, we need to move on to our next fact.

331
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,240
 - Oh, you can get tornadoes of mosquitoes.

332
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,080
 Do you know that?

333
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,120
 With millions of them.

334
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,040
 This is in Russia as well, in Kotakka.

335
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,640
 So you can see videos of them online.

336
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,080
 There's millions and millions of them,

337
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,840
 and they're going round and round, just like a tornado.

338
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,920
 And if you walk into them, like literally,

339
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,000
 you're going for a second,

340
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,680
 and you're covered from head to toe in mosquitoes.

341
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,120
 But you'd never get bitten.

342
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,600
 Do you know why that is?

343
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,920
 - They're dead.

344
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,400
 - Dead? How are they flying?

345
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,120
 - They've been picked up by a tornado.

346
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,960
 I've got confused.

347
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,800
 - Got it, got it.

348
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,440
 - They're not dead, they're not dead, they're not dead.

349
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
 - You're dead.

350
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,360
 (audience laughing)

351
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,200
 You can get this.

352
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,560
 I know you can get this.

353
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,960
 - They're all what?

354
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,640
 - They're all males.

355
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,280
 - They're all males.

356
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,520
 There are a few females there,

357
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,320
 but these are all really, really horny males

358
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,200
 that are spinning around in a tornado

359
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,600
 to attract the female in like a mating dance.

360
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,440
 - Wow.

361
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,160
 - And eventually, you know, they'll have sex,

362
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,600
 but in the meantime, if you walk in them,

363
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
 they won't bite you 'cause only females bite.

364
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
 - Well, that's so nice.

365
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,840
 So not only if they come towards you,

366
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,680
 will they not bite you,

367
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,040
 but it sort of means they fancy you, presumably.

368
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,560
 - I think they'll be disappointed if...

369
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,080
 I mean, they might see my legs and go,

370
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,400
 "They're mosquito legs."

371
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,760
 (audience laughing)

372
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,880
 - I need to move us on, guys.

373
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,160
 We need to go on to our next fact.

374
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,800
 It is time for fact number two,

375
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,000
 and that is Anna.

376
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,840
 - My fact this week is that pigs used to walk to market

377
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,720
 wearing woolen socks.

378
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,720
 (audience laughing)

379
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,920
 This is pigs when they were being walked to market.

380
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,440
 So they would be drove, drove and driven.

381
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,680
 You know, like cattle driving, pig driving.

382
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,040
 It's when people would hire someone

383
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,160
 to take the animals from their farm

384
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,440
 and walk them all the way to the nearest market

385
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,280
 to flog them.

386
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,800
 And it was a huge deal in Britain

387
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,960
 until the Industrial Revolution,

388
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,880
 in Ireland until the Industrial Revolution,

389
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,840
 in Australia and America after it.

390
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,600
 But they had to walk huge distances

391
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,880
 and you had to present your pigs at the other end

392
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,920
 in good condition.

393
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,520
 And so you protected their feet.

394
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,280
 And to do that, they used to put little socks on them,

395
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,920
 but with leather soles.

396
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,880
 So they'd keep them warm, protect them,

397
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,640
 and then they wouldn't graze their hooves on the path,

398
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,360
 and then they killed them and they got there.

399
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
 (audience laughing)

400
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,920
 - And presumably they killed a sheep for their wool,

401
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,720
 maybe not killed, but also the cow for the leather.

402
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,400
 - Yeah, it's three animals in one,

403
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,800
 you're getting for your money.

404
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,360
 - Yeah, droving is very cool stuff.

405
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,680
 (audience laughing)

406
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,520
 No, I--

407
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,360
 - Buckle in.

408
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,200
 (audience laughing)

409
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,120
 - I didn't know about droving at all, or drovers.

410
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,480
 And it was a career that was very well respected.

411
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,360
 So I really like this, in Wales,

412
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,880
 you would have lots of cattle being driven to market.

413
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,000
 And they would often walk from Wales to London.

414
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,680
 And there would be 12 drovers who had 300 cows

415
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,520
 between them, right?

416
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,960
 Pretty demanding stuff.

417
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,080
 The animals which kept the cows in line were corgis.

418
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,040
 That was the original use of the corgis, adorable.

419
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,560
 - They must have been fucking knackered

420
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,240
 by this time they got to London.

421
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,440
 - Little legs, I know, but they were low enough

422
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,520
 to avoid being kicked in the head by a cow.

423
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,160
 So that was their superpower.

424
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,280
 Okay, get this, they get to London,

425
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,480
 the cows are sold, whatever.

426
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,440
 The humans, drovers, and the corgis

427
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,520
 would then travel back to Wales, separately.

428
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,480
 The corgis would go a couple of days ahead

429
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,680
 because they just knew the way home.

430
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,520
 - With who? - Who was droving the corgis?

431
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,240
 - Nobody. - The queen.

432
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,360
 (audience laughing)

433
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,880
 - Genuinely, nobody, nobody was...

434
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,720
 - They just walked back on their own?

435
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,240
 - The corgis just remembered their way home and went.

436
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,200
 - Like a homing pigeon?

437
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,560
 - Like a homing dog.

438
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,120
 And they were just, like, and the drovers

439
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,400
 had to prepay the dog's food and accommodation

440
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,800
 in the pubs along the way.

441
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,880
 - They had nowhere to stop for the night.

442
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,760
 (audience laughing)

443
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,600
 - It's true.

444
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,920
 - They don't know which pubs to stop at.

445
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,960
 - Look, I read this, I read this.

446
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,160
 - They walk in on two legs in a waistcoat

447
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,760
 and say, "Yeah, yeah, you put 200 quid behind the bar."

448
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,920
 Yeah, he definitely did.

449
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,280
 - Three corgis in one waistcoat.

450
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,640
 - Is that why there's never any humans

451
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,040
 in those poker paintings with all the dogs?

452
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,680
 (audience laughing)

453
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,880
 - Absolutely nonsense.

454
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,360
 - It's true, it's true.

455
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,040
 - Unbelievable. - You can't believe it.

456
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,600
 - I read that when the drovers

457
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,080
 would come through the countryside,

458
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,520
 I read that the noise that they would make

459
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,240
 was neither shouting, nor calling,

460
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,400
 nor crying, nor singing, nor hallowing,

461
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,240
 nor anything else.

462
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,080
 - Sorry, I just didn't say anything.

463
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,880
 - No. (audience laughing)

464
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,640
 I think the idea was they would go,

465
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,000
 (growling)

466
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,680
 like that, just make a whole load of noise, right?

467
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,280
 And you would hear them coming from miles and miles away,

468
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,000
 just this holler-balloo of noise.

469
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,320
 And what would you do if you're a local farmer?

470
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,640
 You would hide all of your cows

471
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,720
 and all of your cattle.

472
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,720
 And the reason being that there was so many

473
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,720
 of these cattle coming down the road

474
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,640
 that if your cattle got stuck in there,

475
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
 you'd never get it out again.

476
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,000
 And they'd end up taking it.

477
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,320
 - And they'd just follow like a congerline kind of thing.

478
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,160
 They would just--

479
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,440
 (audience laughing)

480
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,560
 - Yeah, like a congerline.

481
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,400
 - Wow.

482
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,240
 - That's very interesting.

483
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,440
 The reason I started reading about this

484
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,160
 is 'cause my great-great-grandfather was a drover.

485
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,120
 And we are all, on that side of the family,

486
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,440
 irritatingly loud and shrill.

487
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,960
 - It all makes sense though, isn't it?

488
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,920
 - That's where it came from.

489
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,560
 - What was that noise you made, James?

490
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,080
 (James grunting)

491
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,920
 - Oh yeah.

492
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,520
 - Yes, they always had five bottles of wine

493
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,720
 by that point as well.

494
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,080
 (audience laughing)

495
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,960
 - Some Scottish trovers, this is a cool thing.

496
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,000
 The diet would be very limited when you're on the road.

497
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,400
 So the diet would mostly consist of oats, whisky,

498
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,120
 and onions, I don't know, they're proportioned.

499
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,080
 But like, there wasn't much variety in the diet.

500
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,000
 But sometimes they would have a little bonus meal

501
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,520
 because they would drain some of a cow's blood en route

502
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,600
 and then mix it with oatmeal to make black pudding.

503
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,440
 - Oh, would they?

504
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,480
 - But then the cow would kind of stay alive, right?

505
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,520
 They would just do, that's quite cool, isn't it?

506
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,660
 It's like, it's almost, it's not vegan, I wouldn't say.

507
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,840
 (audience laughing)

508
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,680
 - But at least you're not--

509
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,760
 - Oh, it's, how is your restaurant going, James?

510
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,040
 (audience laughing)

511
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,680
 But at least it's sustainable.

512
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,280
 - It's sustainable, yeah, yeah.

513
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,440
 I still think the cow's looking at the oat supply

514
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,160
 dwindling, going, "Oh, fuck."

515
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,000
 (audience laughing)

516
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,160
 They also, they got quite bored, I think,

517
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,840
 drovers on the walk.

518
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,400
 'Cause it was very slow.

519
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,920
 Like, pigs could only go about 10 miles a day.

520
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,480
 And like, pigs are very unwieldy.

521
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,320
 They were the worst.

522
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,140
 They never stuck together.

523
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,360
 Every time they saw mud, they rolled around in it.

524
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,200
 - Taking the socks off, my man.

525
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,600
 (audience laughing)

526
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,240
 It's pig with three fucking socks on.

527
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,840
 Well, now we all have to go back, don't we?

528
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,680
 (audience laughing)

529
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,380
 Because Vinny's lost his sock.

530
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,220
 (audience laughing)

531
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,760
 - Right, it was tedious work.

532
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,480
 Apparently what they did was, they got into knitting,

533
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,840
 which had the obviously double bonus

534
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,920
 of being able to knit the pig's new socks.

535
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,040
 But some of them, there's a really nice description

536
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,400
 of these huge drovers.

537
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,680
 'Cause they were the toughest of the tough guys.

538
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,280
 And they often had a bit of a criminally background.

539
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,240
 Often were into stealing, livestock,

540
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,040
 sort of alongside the droving.

541
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,160
 And like, quite intimidating guys.

542
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,000
 And the description of these big, wild, hairy men

543
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,240
 is how it's described.

544
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,240
 Definitely knitting away a little hat for their niece

545
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,280
 at the back of a bunch of cows.

546
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,120
 - So cool.

547
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,960
 That's really cool.

548
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,240
 - Did you hear about the terrible knitters of Dent?

549
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,800
 (audience laughing)

550
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,280
 - It's a Yorkshire village called Dent.

551
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,320
 And it was a place which was famed for his knitting.

552
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,160
 People needed to supplement their income, very poor area.

553
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,720
 And so they were called terrible

554
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,320
 because of how terribly fast they could do it.

555
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,440
 You know, kind of terrifying.

556
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,280
 - Oh, really?

557
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,120
 - Like awesome, that kind of thing.

558
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,940
 - Oh, God, he made me a shit job.

559
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,920
 - I would say that's quite bad branding.

560
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,760
 - Yeah, it is.

561
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,680
 - If you're selling your socks and you say,

562
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,840
 these are terrible socks, but by terrible,

563
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,600
 I mean, I do them terribly quickly.

564
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,800
 (audience laughing)

565
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,880
 - But yeah, all the guys in Dent would knit.

566
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,920
 And they had a thing called a knitting stick, right?

567
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,160
 Where you stick in your belt and it kind of anchors the wool.

568
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,000
 So then you can knit with one hand as you're walking along.

569
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,840
 Right?

570
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,120
 Some people would knit with one hand

571
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,400
 and churn butter with the other hand.

572
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,600
 - What?

573
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,440
 How cool is that?

574
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,880
 - Who's holding the butterpale?

575
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,680
 You're balancing that on your toes?

576
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,740
 - I don't know.

577
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,580
 - Wow.

578
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,420
 - That's amazing.

579
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,920
 And they're socks that these guys had.

580
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,600
 The other famous thing is that they used to put tar

581
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,240
 on the feet of geese, didn't they?

582
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,080
 - Yes.

583
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,920
 - That's quite a famous one.

584
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,040
 So they would take the geese to London

585
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,320
 from possibly from Norfolk, somewhere like that,

586
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,480
 and they would put tar and sand on the feet of the geese.

587
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,120
 And then when they would walk all the way,

588
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
 it wouldn't hurt their feet

589
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,360
 and they would be much better to sell.

590
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,240
 On specialist aggregates.com,

591
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,800
 which I'm not sure whether they're exactly right,

592
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,600
 but according to them, the current surfaces on roads,

593
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,120
 which is bitumen and like some little bits of aggregate

594
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,360
 as well, that directly comes from this,

595
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,240
 putting the tar on the feet of geese.

596
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,040
 That was invented, then this was invented,

597
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,720
 and then the road was invented.

598
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,520
 So without the geese having tar boots,

599
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,040
 we wouldn't have roads today.

600
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,960
 - Wow.

601
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,800
 - No way.

602
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,640
 - Apparently.

603
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,480
 - Oh my.

604
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,080
 - According to specialist aggregates.com.

605
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,160
 (laughing)

606
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:18,160
 - A website, I don't even understand the name of.

607
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,280
 - Hang on a minute.

608
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,120
 - But I love it.

609
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,480
 - But it's got the word specialist in it.

610
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,760
 - Yeah, it sounds like they know what they're talking about.

611
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,960
 They're specialists and they do aggregates.

612
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,360
 That's like, that's big stuff.

613
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,440
 - Dot com as well.

614
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,280
 - Yeah, yeah.

615
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,840
 - It's not dotco.uk or something.

616
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,680
 - Oh well, yeah.

617
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,520
 - It's a big dog.

618
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,160
 - It's a big dog of the domains.

619
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,000
 - Yeah.

620
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,800
 - So Tom, these specialist aggregates are saying,

621
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,480
 it was only when we saw tar on the feet of geese

622
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,640
 (laughing)

623
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,320
 and realised it wasn't urgent that we thought,

624
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,240
 let's cover everyone's feet in that way.

625
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,400
 That's unsustainable.

626
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,680
 We'll have to peel the tar off every day.

627
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,520
 Let's just cover the roads in that.

628
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,280
 - That would have been a way more sustainable way

629
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
 for us all to do it.

630
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,440
 - No, 'cause you don't want tar on your feet

631
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,280
 the whole time.

632
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,120
 - No, no, no, no.

633
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,960
 You're going out in the morning,

634
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,320
 you just dip in the tar bath.

635
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,440
 Like you just trend through that.

636
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,840
 Like at the entrance of a swimming pool,

637
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,120
 we have that little bit to walk through to clean your feet.

638
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,640
 Everyone just walks through that on the way.

639
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,080
 We never bothered inventing the road

640
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,640
 'cause everyone's wearing their own road on their feet.

641
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,000
 - You'd have to cover all your car in tar, wouldn't you?

642
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,720
 - Yeah, I'm not sure how the wheels actually work.

643
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,920
 (laughing)

644
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,640
 - It was tar spray and chip,

645
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,680
 which is a process that they used on the feet of the geese.

646
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,360
 And that is exactly the same process as we used to make.

647
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,960
 - I'm gonna go out on a limb and say,

648
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,000
 we would have managed the whole tarring roads thing

649
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,360
 without even the geese.

650
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,160
 So I'm gonna keep eating one at Christmas.

651
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,360
 - Look, I would criticize that, but to be honest,

652
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,920
 I'm looking for a bit of support for my corgis thing.

653
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,840
 And I'm willing to say I buy it.

654
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,680
 - Have you guys heard,

655
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,880
 it's quite a famous pub in Scotland called The Drowers Inn.

656
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,720
 - Yeah, I've stayed in that.

657
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,960
 - You've stayed in the Drowers Inn?

658
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,120
 - On my honeymoon, I did.

659
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,080
 - You're kidding.

660
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

661
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,880
 Just, I spent the whole time telling my wife

662
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,280
 about the history of droving.

663
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

664
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,760
 In between fending off corgis from the door.

665
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,960
 (laughing)

666
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,080
 This is in Loch Loughman in Scotland, right?

667
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,120
 It's near Loch Loughman, yeah.

668
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,680
 - Yeah, so tell me if you experience this.

669
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,520
 - It is a ghost.

670
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,720
 - It's one of the most haunted places in-

671
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,760
 - That's why we stayed there.

672
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,600
 - What?

673
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

674
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,960
 - Ow, it's haunted by a ghost drover called Angus.

675
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,000
 And Angus, so he was killed as part of his droving.

676
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,440
 His droving group of animals were stolen

677
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,080
 and they supposedly killed him.

678
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,680
 But there's all these reports from the inn where they say,

679
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,600
 like someone said that they fell asleep one night

680
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,800
 and when they woke up in the morning,

681
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,920
 their camera was sitting in a different spot.

682
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,560
 And then when they looked in the camera,

683
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,320
 there was all these photos of them sleeping in the bed.

684
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,160
 - That was not proof.

685
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,320
 - That was when I was there.

686
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,520
 (laughing)

687
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,400
 - That's just proof of a pervert.

688
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,280
 It's not a ghost.

689
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,360
 - What pervert goes in, doesn't bring a camera,

690
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,160
 hoping that someone else has left the camera,

691
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,480
 takes the photos and then leaves them.

692
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,160
 (laughing)

693
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,800
 - A very specialist one.

694
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,720
 (laughing)

695
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,760
 - That's amazing.

696
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,800
 Yeah, I saw it.

697
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,640
 What was he called?

698
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,960
 Angus. - Angus.

699
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,440
 - Yeah, I saw him and he said,

700
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,240
 that thing about geese is definitely true.

701
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,500
 (laughing)

702
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,120
 - Any word on the corgis?

703
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,240
 - We've got to move on very soon.

704
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,080
 I've got to think about transporting animals

705
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,240
 from one place to the other.

706
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,640
 And I know the four of us know this,

707
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,040
 but I do love how they often have to transport rhinos

708
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,720
 in Africa to different places.

709
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,880
 And the way, the best way that they've worked out to do it

710
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
 is to sedate the rhinos.

711
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,560
 And then, carry them, tie up their legs

712
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,640
 and carry them upside down by helicopter

713
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,600
 and fly them to the destination they go to.

714
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,960
 So it could be the case that if you're in certain parts

715
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,560
 of Africa, if you look to the sky,

716
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,480
 there will be an upside down rhino flying past you.

717
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,040
 And the article I was reading,

718
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,480
 they were transporting 10 rhinos.

719
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,360
 So 10 rhinos were going past in the sky.

720
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
 I'm not sure at the same time,

721
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,440
 but you would have seen 10 rhinos during the day.

722
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,320
 And one quite nice thing that they do

723
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,520
 as part of the process is, so the rhino is sedated,

724
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,280
 but they blindfold the rhino

725
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,760
 because just in case it wakes up mid-trip,

726
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,280
 they go, "What?!"

727
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,400
 (LAUGHTER)

728
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
 It's just a little sweet touch to make sure,

729
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,160
 at least it's like, "Ah, OK, some sort of prank is going on."

730
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,000
 It is amazing.

731
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,120
 It's not that common.

732
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,600
 If you do take a safari just to see that,

733
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,760
 it's not guaranteed.

734
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,640
 But they tried it with bees first, didn't they?

735
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,720
 But you need too many to lift them up.

736
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,040
 That's the thing.

737
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,120
 We need to move on to our next fact, guys.

738
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,840
 It is time for fact number three,

739
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,720
 and that is Andy.

740
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,080
 My fact is that when hosting parties,

741
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,720
 singer Dean Martin would sometimes ring the police

742
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,440
 pretending to be an angry neighbour

743
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,880
 so that they would ask his guests to go home instead of him.

744
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,920
 (LAUGHTER)

745
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,840
 So good.

746
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,720
 What a genius.

747
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,320
 You know what? When you sent this...

748
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,520
 (CHEERING)

749
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,000
 When you sent this back round,

750
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,800
 the first thing I thought is, "I bet Andy's going to do this."

751
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
 100%. I don't have guests.

752
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,920
 But... (LAUGHTER)

753
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,200
 This was... It's been documented in a few places,

754
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,680
 so it was in a documentary about him,

755
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,440
 and his son wrote a book about growing up being Dean Martin's son.

756
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,360
 Dean Martin, an incredibly famous mid-20th-century singer,

757
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,120
 member of the Rat Pack, and he was very reserved.

758
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,280
 Actually, he had this...

759
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,440
 He gave the impression of being a very sociable,

760
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,320
 heavy drinker, great party guy.

761
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,400
 He really wasn't. His wife was very sociable,

762
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,800
 and they would have a lot of parties.

763
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,120
 And Dean Martin wanted to be up in bed, basically.

764
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,400
 Yeah, apparently, I read that he often wanted to play golf in the morning

765
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,560
 and so would get an early night, which really endeared me to him.

766
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,280
 Yeah. This is the kind of guy we like. Yeah.

767
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,480
 Well, I think he was... We say that he didn't drink that much,

768
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
 and that was the impression.

769
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,520
 We've mentioned on the show before,

770
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,320
 Dean Martin used to have his own TV show,

771
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,520
 and he would constantly have a drink in his hand,

772
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,880
 like a whiskey or something.

773
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,240
 And actually, it was apple juice,

774
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,040
 because it was part of his stick that he would be drunk on stage.

775
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,400
 But he was someone who did drink a lot.

776
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,880
 Like, his license plate to one of his cars was drunky,

777
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,280
 so it had a Y at the end of it.

778
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,120
 That's just asking for trouble from the police.

779
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,840
 Yeah. Well, it definitely did,

780
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,600
 when he had to change it to another car,

781
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,840
 because he crashed that car when he was drink-driving and was arrested.

782
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,120
 OK, I'm not saying he never had a drink. It's true.

783
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,560
 But he did. You know, he was a lot more reserved than the impression he gave.

784
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,280
 And basically, the story is, one night,

785
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,120
 that his wife was having yet another party.

786
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,720
 He was upstairs in his pyjamas, just wanting the noise to stop.

787
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,560
 And so he phoned the police and complained,

788
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,280
 and the police turned up at the door, and they said,

789
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,280
 "Look, we're sorry we've had a complaint from the neighbours."

790
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,160
 It happened again a few weeks later.

791
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,440
 He phoned the police and put on a voice, said, "I'm a neighbour."

792
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,000
 His wife started getting suspicious,

793
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,280
 because the neighbours lived about two miles away.

794
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,280
 They had a big home and a big property, and, like,

795
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,600
 were you hearing that much noise?

796
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,200
 Anyway, it happened again a few weeks after this.

797
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,640
 And he phoned up and said,

798
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,360
 "Oh, I'm a neighbour of Dean Martins, and he's having a party."

799
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,320
 And the police just said,

800
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,400
 "OK, Mr. Martins, we'll be right over."

801
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,480
 He was really reserved to Jean Martin, who was his first wife.

802
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,800
 She said that when she first met him, it was love at first sight.

803
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,400
 They got married really quickly,

804
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,200
 and she said that she'd married him, knowing nothing about him.

805
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,240
 And when they divorced 23 years later,

806
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,000
 she still knew nothing about him.

807
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,680
 - Wow. - Yeah.

808
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,200
 - Except that he hated parties. - Yeah.

809
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,600
 I'd say, on a personal level, as a kid,

810
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,880
 I grew up on Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis movies.

811
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
 And he was so cool.

812
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,400
 Like, he was part of the Ramp Act,

813
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,400
 which was Frank Sinatra, was Sammy Davis Jr.

814
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,000
 They were this group of crooning singers who also acted

815
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,800
 and had these mafia ties, and they used to do Las Vegas.

816
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,040
 - Cool. - Yeah.

817
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,880
 But they were seeing that at the time,

818
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,600
 and Dean was seen as the coolest person within that.

819
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,000
 And part of his cool was that he was just an incredibly lazy guy.

820
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,800
 So he never used to do rehearsals for the show that he did,

821
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,200
 which was a weekly show.

822
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,120
 He would have a stand-in do every rehearsal.

823
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,400
 This was part of his contract,

824
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
 for which he was paid tens of millions,

825
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,400
 and he would just rock up and just do the lines on the night

826
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
 and then leave before the show was even done

827
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,400
 to get home to be boring as fuck, as you pointed out.

828
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,400
 His producer said, "When Dean walks through the studio floor

829
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,400
 "on the morning of the show, he doesn't know what he's going to sing,

830
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,400
 "what he's going to say, who the guest stars are going to be.

831
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
 "And it reminded me of working with you, Dan."

832
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,400
 - Cool guy. - Yeah, cool.

833
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,400
 Heavy mafia ties is what I'm trying to imply.

834
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,400
 There's an Italian word for this called a menefligismo,

835
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
 which I have probably mispronounced,

836
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
 which basically means I don't give a damn.

837
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,400
 I don't give a damnism, which is what he did, which sounded a bit cocky.

838
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
 But he admitted it himself.

839
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,400
 He said, "I can just about carry a tune, but I'm not really a good singer."

840
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,400
 We crew members just get by on being lazy and painless to listen to.

841
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,400
 This is how lazy he was. He did a movie called The Caddy,

842
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,400
 and in The Caddy he sang a song that Capitol Records said,

843
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
 "We want to re-record this because we want to release it.

844
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
 "We think it's a hit."

845
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,400
 And he just went, "I don't want to do that."

846
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
 And they were like, "Please, we think it's a hit."

847
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
 He said, "I don't want to do that."

848
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,400
 So Capitol Records just had to go into the movies recording that he did,

849
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
 take that and release it,

850
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
 and that song was That's Amore,

851
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,400
 which went on to be his biggest hit and sold millions of copies.

852
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
 He wasn't interested.

853
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,400
 When you don't give a shit about your biggest hit, That's Amore.

854
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,400
 I think we're a bit harsh about him being so reserved and antisocial and stuff,

855
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,400
 because I think the reason is, or one of the main reasons,

856
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,400
 is that he didn't speak any English until he was about five or six years old.

857
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
 He was brought up in an Italian family,

858
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,400
 and so he was never really confident in his English,

859
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
 and when he would have conversations with people

860
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,400
 who would often feel like he didn't really know what to say and stuff like that.

861
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
 Yeah, that's true.

862
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,400
 There's another nice thing about him, which is, again, a mark of him being reserved,

863
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,400
 which is he and Frank Sinatra were in Las Vegas,

864
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,400
 and they were having a great time.

865
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,400
 Frank Sinatra was surrounded by foxy ladies at the blackjack table, whatever.

866
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,400
 The rest of them were corgis that were stopping along the way.

867
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,400
 A load of corgis around, and Dean Martin went to bed because,

868
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
 as James pointed out, he was playing golf the next morning,

869
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
 wanted to get a good night's sleep.

870
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,400
 The story is that Sinatra gave a call girl a thousand dollars to go upstairs

871
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
 to give Dean a good time,

872
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,400
 and Dean then gave the call girl two thousand dollars to just go downstairs

873
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
 and say he had been amazing.

874
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,400
 Was that in the, could have been in the Sands Hotel,

875
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
 which they were particularly famous for staying here.

876
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,400
 There's just the Rat Pack Hotel that Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin,

877
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
 the rest of the Rat Pack stayed in,

878
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,400
 and they caused various scandals there,

879
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
 mostly Frank Sinatra behaving badly, I think.

880
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
 One night he was served mushrooms in his meal,

881
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
 and he didn't want mushrooms in his meal,

882
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,400
 so he tipped the entire meal over his own head, which I quite like.

883
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,400
 And then he started, he chased the waiter into the kitchen shouting,

884
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
 "I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover!"

885
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,400
 Terrifying.

886
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,400
 I don't know, he obviously doesn't hate mushrooms as much as me,

887
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,400
 because I can imagine chasing the waiter and stuff,

888
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,400
 but pouring it over your own head, that would be awful.

889
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,400
 Yeah, well maybe you'd go one step further.

890
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,400
 You might have done actually what he did, which is eventually get kicked out,

891
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,400
 because he had accrued so many gambling debts that he had to leave.

892
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,400
 So he climbed onto one of the tables, started screaming abuse at everyone,

893
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,400
 threw a chair at the casino boss, who then punched him in the face,

894
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,400
 and then apparently he exited the hotel by driving a golf cart through the window.

895
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
 Wow.

896
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
 Sounds like me.

897
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,400
 So he was a shoplifter as well, wasn't he?

898
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,400
 And apparently what he would do is he would go to a clothes shop,

899
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
 and he would buy loads and loads and loads of stuff,

900
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,400
 but then he would steal a couple of things,

901
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,400
 and he would be like, "Well, they don't mind, because I'm spending so much money,

902
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
 but he just wanted the thrill of stealing some stuff."

903
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,400
 When you walk from the till for a bit of a thrill, that's a moray.

904
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,400
 It was less applause that time.

905
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
 Yeah, I think everyone saw me...

906
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,400
 Have you ever heard the phrase "diminishing returns"?

907
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,400
 Everyone saw me slowly approaching the goal line on that one from a distance.

908
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,400
 Is he going to get there?

909
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,400
 Shoplifting would have been a particular challenge for him,

910
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
 because he had huge hands.

911
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
 That's better.

912
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,400
 You can hide the objects in your fist.

913
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
 Yeah, but you can't do it sneakily.

914
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,400
 Everyone's going to be like, "What's that massive hand coming into the pick-and-mix?"

915
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,400
 He's not stealing pick-and-mix, is he?

916
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,400
 I think because you knock a lot of other stuff off, and they're quite fat hands,

917
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
 I mean, they were wide hands.

918
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,400
 He was self-conscious enough about them that according to a friend of his,

919
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,400
 he used to put makeup on them to make them smaller.

920
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,400
 What shade lines do you mean?

921
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
 What are we talking about here?

922
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,400
 You can't make your hands look smaller with makeup, surely?

923
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,400
 Well, you don't need to, so you've never had to investigate this, Andy.

924
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
 Excuse me.

925
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,400
 With that wanting to go all Donald Trump here.

926
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,400
 There's no problem.

927
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
 I don't know how you... I haven't tried it, but apparently...

928
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
 If anything, my hands make it look enormous, so...

929
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
 Chokes on you.

930
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,400
 I can't see how it was hindering his stealing.

931
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
 How a shade line is going to be like...

932
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,400
 What does that guy with the minuscule fingers of a pianist think?

933
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,400
 He didn't wear the makeup to aid his shoplifting career.

934
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
 That's not what I'm claiming.

935
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
 I think the wide hands wouldn't help.

936
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
 If you're trying to pick something off a shelf to put in your bag,

937
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,400
 and then you knock 17 other things off with your flabby fingers,

938
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,400
 wafting everywhere, then I think that's a hindrance.

939
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,400
 But also, his hands, they were quite mangled, weren't they, as well,

940
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
 so I think that would be one reason.

941
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,400
 He was a boxer as a late teenager in early 20s,

942
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,400
 and apparently he got really badly injured on his hands.

943
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
 According to his obituary in the Guardian,

944
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
 he gave up boxing because his hands were quite mangled,

945
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,400
 and then he became a card dealer, and he gave that up

946
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,400
 because his hands were on show so much.

947
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,400
 And he didn't want people to see his hands, he was quite embarrassed by them.

948
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,400
 I wouldn't box someone who had hands the size of a head.

949
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
 That feels like cheating, doesn't it?

950
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,400
 But if he was wearing strategic makeup on his hands,

951
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,400
 to make them look tiny, you'd get in the ring.

952
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,400
 He used to do almost like weird fight club style fighting.

953
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
 But we can't talk about that coming.

954
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
 Yeah, let's move on.

955
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,400
 But I did read this in one place where in the apartment that he lived in,

956
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,400
 people would sort of buzz in and they would come up,

957
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,400
 and then him and his flatmates would just beat each other up

958
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,400
 until one was knocked out, and then people would leave

959
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
 and then they would just still be in the flat with each other

960
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
 and go, "Same time tomorrow, what's for dinner?"

961
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
 You know, they were flatmates doing it.

962
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
 Other people watching them box.

963
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

964
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
 You came to watch a boxing match in someone's apartment.

965
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
 That supposedly is a story.

966
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
 I would 100% go to that.

967
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
 Really?

968
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
 Two of my friends said they're going to have a fight.

969
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
 Yeah.

970
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
 I'm not missing that.

971
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,400
 Having met some of your friends, I actually wouldn't go to see that.

972
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
 I'm afraid.

973
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,400
 A couple of scratches, some hair pulled, and then a cup of tea.

974
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,400
 Okay, well...

975
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,400
 We do need to move on to our final fact.

976
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
 Anything before we do?

977
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
 He opened a restaurant, didn't he?

978
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,400
 So, basically, you had Dean Martin and you had Jerry Lewis, did you say?

979
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
 Yeah, Jerry Lewis.

980
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
 And they were kind of partners in crime.

981
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
 They had all these films.

982
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
 Dean Martin was the crooner,

983
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,400
 and Jerry Lewis would always kind of jump in and do a funny thing,

984
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,400
 and he'd never kind of get to the end of his songs and stuff like that.

985
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,400
 And then Dean Martin really hated this towards the end.

986
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
 They made loads and loads of money, loads and loads of movies,

987
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,400
 but he got kind of a little bit jealous, I would say.

988
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
 The two of them fell out.

989
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
 Anyway, Dean Martin started a restaurant,

990
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,400
 and then about maybe half a year later, Jerry Lewis started a restaurant

991
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,400
 just down the road and stole his head chef and brought him in as a matriot D.

992
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,400
 And what was brilliant about that is that Dean Martin was really, really cool.

993
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
 Like you said, he's a really cool guy.

994
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,400
 He had all of his rat-packed friends, came, and it was a really nice ambience.

995
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,400
 But Jerry Lewis, it just had a massive picture of his face,

996
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,400
 and just loads of gaudy Jerry Lewis stuff everywhere,

997
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,400
 and he ended up losing about $300,000.

998
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,400
 And he only opened it because he wanted to piss off his mate.

999
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
 So it was Jerry Lewis who lost the money.

1000
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1001
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,400
 I ain't not a kick in the head, you know?

1002
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:01,400
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1003
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,400
 and that is James.

1004
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,400
 Okay, you haven't heard it yet.

1005
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,400
 Okay, my fact this week is that caves in Tasmania include

1006
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
 Poo Shooter Cave,

1007
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
 Itchy Hole,

1008
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,400
 Horrible Accident Cave,

1009
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,400
 and Dead Horse Cave,

1010
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,400
 which was named because at the bottom of it, they found the remains of a cow.

1011
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
 I've just got that joke.

1012
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
 It's not a joke, it's true.

1013
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
 It's what happens.

1014
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
 They call it Dead Horse Cave even though there was a cow.

1015
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1016
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
 It's good.

1017
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
 Oh, that's comedy.

1018
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,400
 Oh, no, it's good.

1019
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,400
 You're sort of doing the subtitles for people who don't get jokes.

1020
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
 They're all for me, Anna.

1021
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
 They're all for me.

1022
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
 A lot of questions,

1023
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,400
 but I guess let's start with the horse cow confusion.

1024
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
 Okay, yes, so they found the skeleton,

1025
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,400
 and at first they thought it was a horse, and it turned out to be a cow.

1026
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,400
 Basically, what happened was earlier this month,

1027
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
 we're doing the T-Series of QI at the moment,

1028
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
 and we're looking for things beginning with T,

1029
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
 and I was looking at something called Takikardia,

1030
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
 which means like a fast heartbeat,

1031
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,400
 and I found a place called Takikardia Cave, which is in Tasmania,

1032
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
 and because when they first went in the people,

1033
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,400
 they got a real shot of a heart, almost like a heart type,

1034
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
 and they were like, "Wow, this is amazing."

1035
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,400
 So then I just got into a massive detour about caves in Tasmania

1036
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,400
 and spent about a week looking at these things,

1037
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
 and I found a list of caves,

1038
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,400
 and this is just in the Junea Florentine area of south, southern Tasmania,

1039
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,400
 and it was in a caving magazine from 2006,

1040
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
 and there's a guy called Greg Middleton,

1041
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,400
 and he listed all of the caves where all the names came from,

1042
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,400
 and I love it, and I messaged him, and he got back to me,

1043
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,400
 and he says his database now has 6,955 Australian caves

1044
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
 that he's gone and tried to find the etymologies of.

1045
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
 Can we read some?

1046
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
 Oh, yeah, I mean, my favourite of all...

1047
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,400
 I'll just go straight to my favourite, which is Harry Goat Hole.

1048
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,400
 OK, and I spoke to this guy, Greg Middleton, about this,

1049
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,400
 and apparently the name "Harry Goat Hole" comes from a job,

1050
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
 which was a "Harry Goat".

1051
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
 So this was a human who would be this,

1052
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,400
 and what you would do is you would walk around an area of Tasmania

1053
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
 with a pair of shorts on,

1054
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
 and you would walk and you would just wait

1055
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,400
 so you felt a little bit of air going up your trousers,

1056
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
 and then when you felt that little tickle,

1057
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
 it meant there was a cave below you,

1058
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
 and that's how they used to find caves,

1059
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
 and they used to call them the "Harry Goat",

1060
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,400
 and one of the ones that they found was called "Harry Goat Hole".

1061
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,400
 I love it. No way.

1062
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
 I've got a question.

1063
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,400
 These cavers, are they the ones who are choosing the name,

1064
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,400
 or do some of the caves already have names?

1065
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
 It's usually if you've found one, you get to name it.

1066
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,400
 And it seems to be that they have a board of caving experts

1067
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
 who are doing this, and they meet together,

1068
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
 and so they write the sort of notes.

1069
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
 So you have ones that are like called "menage à trois",

1070
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,400
 and the notes will say "cave with three tiny entrances".

1071
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
 No further details.

1072
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
 Or you have "toss pot".

1073
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
 The description of why it's called that says

1074
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
 "I took a long time exploring,

1075
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
 and on emerging from the hole, Gavin made the remark,

1076
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
 'Gee, you took your time. What were you doing there?

1077
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
 Having a toss?'"

1078
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
 That's why it's called that.

1079
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,400
 Is the cave and committee comprised entirely of 13-year-old boys?

1080
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
 Pretty much.

1081
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
 There is another theory that that comes from the...

1082
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
 like they threw a lot of rocks down there,

1083
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
 and they were tossing rocks down there.

1084
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,400
 There's two reasons for it in the spreadsheet.

1085
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,400
 Names in Tasmania in general are extraordinary.

1086
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,400
 There's a British film called "Strumpshore, Tinkleton and Giggleswick",

1087
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
 and they...

1088
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
 They are a comedy film.

1089
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,400
 They find interesting and amusing place names for all over the world,

1090
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,400
 and so they did Australia and Tasmania recently,

1091
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
 and they make maps of them.

1092
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,400
 So Tasmania has "Thrush Forest", "Mossy Nipple Bend",

1093
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
 "Misery Knob", "Funny Knob Creek",

1094
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,400
 "Guy's Dirty Hole",

1095
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
 "The Butts, The Nipples", "Tongue's Point".

1096
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,400
 It's got an incredible number of really...

1097
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
 It's weird because it's an absolutely stunning place.

1098
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
 Yeah.

1099
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
 I don't know what they're trying to do. Repel tourists?

1100
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,400
 It's very weird.

1101
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,400
 Lovely bottom plays up there.

1102
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
 Thank you, but we are in the middle of a show, Dan.

1103
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
 I had to acknowledge it.

1104
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
 We were all thinking it.

1105
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,400
 I mean, lovely bottom is one but of but a number of bottoms in Tasmania.

1106
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
 Lots of bottoms.

1107
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
 Lovely bottom, prickly bottom, deep bottom,

1108
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
 officer's bottom, broad bottom, bottom fancy.

1109
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,400
 Boomer's bottom, round bottom, stumpy's bottom, bottom lagoon.

1110
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
 Lake Fanny.

1111
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,400
 The Butts and the But of Liberty.

1112
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
 They're all in Tasmania.

1113
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
 All named after one person, weren't they?

1114
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,400
 Also, they've got a place called Baghdad,

1115
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
 and Baghdad and Tasmania.

1116
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,400
 It's only got about 650 people living there,

1117
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
 but in 2003, a lot of people...

1118
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
 America invaded.

1119
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,400
 Josh W. Bush is like, "It's around here somewhere."

1120
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
 Cover all the bases.

1121
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
 And they still lost.

1122
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,400
 But their website, the Tau website, got inundated with people

1123
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
 messaging them with sympathy, going,

1124
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,400
 "If there's anything we can do for you, we will try and help."

1125
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,400
 No, they did. It was reported that they had something like

1126
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,400
 15,000 hits in the month after the invasion of Iraq,

1127
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,400
 where they had people mistaking them as the actual Baghdad.

1128
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,400
 Which doesn't make sense,

1129
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,400
 because this is going to the website manager, Lorraine Bennett,

1130
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,400
 who said, "Our number of hits doubled to 15,000."

1131
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
 Now, the town population is 650.

1132
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,400
 I do not believe they were getting 7,500 hits before that.

1133
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,400
 I thought that as well. What an insane claim.

1134
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,400
 What is it, Baghdad.com?

1135
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
 Because they might have got people accidentally going on.

1136
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
 It's Baghdad without the H in the middle, right?

1137
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
 So it's spelt very slightly differently.

1138
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,400
 You land up there, you think, "Oh, Baghdad looks a little different

1139
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,400
 to how I imagined a major Middle Eastern city would look."

1140
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,400
 But, okay, did they take the money? They should have.

1141
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,400
 No, no, it wasn't comic relief. It was a...

1142
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
 No, but people were writing, offering help.

1143
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,400
 Oh, no, it was just support, like, "Good luck."

1144
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,400
 And I'm skeptical again, because Lorraine Kelly said,

1145
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,400
 "We're getting messages from everywhere.

1146
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
 We're getting messages from Yugoslavia."

1147
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,400
 Why? Sorry. Do you say Lorraine Kelly?

1148
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,400
 Lorraine Bennett. It was Lorraine Bennett.

1149
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
 You can see how this kind of thing happens.

1150
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,400
 I did have to check.

1151
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,400
 Paul Lorraine Kelly is now getting messages from locals

1152
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,400
 asking about, "This week in Baghdad and Tasmania,

1153
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,400
 are we still having the market sale or..."

1154
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,400
 Are there funny place names in Tasmania?

1155
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
 If you want to really dig deep,

1156
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,400
 if you go to the government list of them,

1157
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,400
 if it's place names, or one word, placenames.tas.gov.au,

1158
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,400
 you can search any name of anywhere in Tasmania,

1159
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,400
 and you will get sort of a full list,

1160
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
 like a really proper official list of when it was discovered,

1161
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
 when it was named, who named it,

1162
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
 various debates that have happened in various council meetings

1163
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
 over the years about whether they should change the name

1164
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,400
 from Tit Valley to Boob Valley or whatever.

1165
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
 And it's incredible.

1166
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
 They've gone into the reason for all of these names.

1167
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,400
 So, Milkshake Hills,

1168
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,400
 it seemed due to apparently the similarity

1169
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,400
 of the Hills to Women's Breasts.

1170
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,400
 - Okay. - Oh, really?

1171
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,400
 There's lots of that in the States as well.

1172
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
 - With Milkshake. - Yeah.

1173
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,400
 Australian Women's Breasts produce Milkshake,

1174
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,400
 another weird thing about Australia.

1175
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
 There's Trousers Point,

1176
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,400
 which apparently commemorates the lucky escape

1177
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,400
 of a certain John Burgess,

1178
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,400
 who, without his trousers,

1179
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,400
 escaped from the wreck nearby of the Sarah Anne Blanche in 1871.

1180
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,400
 Just so good.

1181
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
 Mount Miss Management.

1182
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
 Bloke was naming it, left his compass behind,

1183
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
 got all the way back to base, had to go back there.

1184
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
 (LAUGHTER)

1185
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,400
 I love this place in Tasmania,

1186
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
 and if we ever get back there, I want to visit.

1187
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
 It's called Dewtown, D-W-O town.

1188
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,400
 And so, this is 79 kilometres southeast of Hobart,

1189
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
 and it was established in the 1830s,

1190
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
 and it was a sort of timber station,

1191
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,400
 which eventually has become a shack community.

1192
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,400
 So, there's a lot of people living there.

1193
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
 In 1935, an architect called Eric Round

1194
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,400
 put up this name plate that said,

1195
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,400
 "Do I 99?"

1196
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,400
 That was just the name of his house.

1197
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,400
 Then someone next to him saw the "do"

1198
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
 and put "do me" as their sign.

1199
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
 They're forward.

1200
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
 And then the next person put a sign saying,

1201
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
 "do us."

1202
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,400
 And then slowly, everyone just started renaming their places

1203
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,400
 as something to do with "do."

1204
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
 So, if you go to Dewtown now, which is what it's called,

1205
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
 you will find houses that are all called

1206
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
 "do us, too."

1207
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
 "Didgeridoo."

1208
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,400
 You got "do nothing."

1209
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,400
 "Dr. Doolittle."

1210
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,400
 "Love me, do."

1211
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,400
 And "do fuck all" is the last one I have.

1212
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,400
 There's actually, isn't there one house

1213
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
 that hasn't abided by this,

1214
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,400
 and is called Medhurst?

1215
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,400
 Everyone in that town must really hate them.

1216
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,400
 It's like, come on, you've got to do it.

1217
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,400
 Susan, are you sure you don't want to,

1218
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,400
 because we're all doing the cool thing?

1219
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
 Do it.

1220
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,400
 That list of places in Tasmania

1221
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,400
 that you were talking about, Anna,

1222
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
 I found one on there which is called "Hard to Find Dam."

1223
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,400
 It does seem like it's a place according to the website,

1224
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,400
 but there's no results on Google Maps.

1225
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,400
 Really?

1226
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,400
 There's a thing in Tasmania

1227
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,400
 that they started doing last year,

1228
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,400
 which is enhancing their dual naming policy.

1229
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,400
 So, basically, Tasmanian places had settler names,

1230
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,400
 and then started to be giving

1231
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,400
 kind of a range of Aboriginal names

1232
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,400
 in the late 19th century,

1233
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
 because Tasmania has a horrendous history

1234
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,400
 of dealing with the Aboriginal community.

1235
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,400
 There was a time in 1876

1236
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,400
 where it was close to extinguished,

1237
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,400
 where everyone suddenly went,

1238
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,400
 "Shit, we should start calling stuff Aboriginal names."

1239
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,400
 So now there's a policy of renaming a lot of places,

1240
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,400
 or giving places two names.

1241
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,400
 One would be the Aboriginal name,

1242
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,400
 and one would be the settler name,

1243
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
 but they were quite random and often had no relation

1244
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,400
 to the place was.

1245
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,400
 So they named things like a Marawa,

1246
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
 which means number one, no one knows why,

1247
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,400
 Kamona means venom,

1248
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,400
 and Tanina, Tanina Bluff,

1249
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,400
 means to fart.

1250
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,400
 No one knows why.

1251
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,400
 They used one which was Laiawini,

1252
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,400
 it means frigid or cold.

1253
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,400
 They just randomly gave it that name,

1254
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
 but they later found out that it is actually

1255
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,400
 the coldest town in the whole of Tasmania,

1256
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
 which is by coincidence.

1257
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,400
 We're going to have to wrap up soon, guys.

1258
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,400
 I'm sorry, Douglas.

1259
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
 I've got some Irish cave names,

1260
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,400
 if you want to hear them.

1261
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
 That is the best reaction

1262
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,400
 that has ever got anywhere in the world.

1263
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,400
 Irish caves, here we go.

1264
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,400
 Cockpot.

1265
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,400
 Cool cave.

1266
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,400
 That sounds good. Dave's pot.

1267
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,400
 No name hole.

1268
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,400
 Rubbish cave.

1269
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,400
 And Tory Hole.

1270
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,400
 Oh.

1271
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,400
 And apparently every year at Tory Hole

1272
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,400
 there's a party.

1273
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,400
 No, stop it.

1274
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,400
 Honestly.

1275
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,400
 It's a work event, James.

1276
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,400
 They've been incredibly clear.

1277
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:03,400
 Basically, loads of people flocked

1278
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,400
 to Tory Hole,

1279
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,400
 and apparently what happened was

1280
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
 many years ago there was a fiddler,

1281
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
 and the fiddler went inside Tory Hole,

1282
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,400
 and

1283
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,400
 come on.

1284
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,400
 Like, God, guys, it's your own time you're wasting.

1285
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,400
 He was never seen again,

1286
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,400
 the fiddler,

1287
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,400
 and now every year people go to Tory Hole

1288
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,400
 and they can hear music emanating

1289
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,400
 from Tory Hole. Wow.

1290
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,400
 I just think it sounds like Boris Johnson's

1291
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,400
 chat-up line.

1292
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,400
 Well, fancy a fiddler in Tory Hole?

1293
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,400
 Yeah.

1294
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,400
 Music comes out once a year.

1295
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,400
 Yeah.

1296
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
 All right, look.

1297
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,400
 We need to wrap up. That is it.

1298
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,400
