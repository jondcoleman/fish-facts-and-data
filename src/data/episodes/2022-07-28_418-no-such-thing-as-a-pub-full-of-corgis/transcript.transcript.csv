00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:17,00:00:21,"and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:00:21,00:00:25,this week coming to you live from Dublin.
00:00:25,00:00:28,(audience cheering)
00:00:29,00:00:31,My name is Dan Shriver.
00:00:31,00:00:34,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:34,00:00:37,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:37,00:00:40,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:00:40,00:00:43,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:43,00:00:47,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:47,00:00:52,"Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact."
00:00:52,00:00:55,My fact this week is that there is a town in Russia
00:00:55,00:01:00,that hosts an annual festival to celebrate mosquitoes.
00:01:00,00:01:04,The main event is the most delicious competition
00:01:04,00:01:06,in which girls compete to see how many times
00:01:06,00:01:07,they can get bitten by a mosquito
00:01:07,00:01:10,after standing around for 20 minutes.
00:01:10,00:01:12,(audience laughing)
00:01:12,00:01:14,Now I should say it's not one mosquito
00:01:14,00:01:15,that's doing the biting.
00:01:15,00:01:18,"- In actual fact, sometimes it's no mosquitoes."
00:01:18,00:01:23,"So in 2014, this was the second version of this festival."
00:01:23,00:01:24,"They did it next to the city pond,"
00:01:24,00:01:27,but it was so cold that all the mosquitoes had died.
00:01:27,00:01:29,(audience laughing)
00:01:29,00:01:32,And so it was a no scar draw in the end.
00:01:32,00:01:33,Everyone got no bites.
00:01:33,00:01:34,"- Oh, well there you go."
00:01:34,00:01:37,- Can you lure mosquitoes to you?
00:01:37,00:01:39,"- No, there are kind of strict rules about this."
00:01:39,00:01:43,"So this is in Berezniki, which is in the Ural Mountains."
00:01:43,00:01:44,This is in Russia.
00:01:44,00:01:47,And you would send out these girls with their parents
00:01:47,00:01:51,"into a forest, and they would go picking berries."
00:01:51,00:01:53,- It's just sort of a Grimm's fairy tale.
00:01:53,00:01:55,(audience laughing)
00:01:55,00:01:57,"- I think, so the idea is that they just pick berries,"
00:01:57,00:02:00,"and it's very kind of, yes, dark, but."
00:02:00,00:02:02,"- Wait, do the girls know they're in this competition?"
00:02:02,00:02:03,"- Yes, they do."
00:02:03,00:02:05,"- I assume they must do, yeah."
00:02:05,00:02:07,"And so they spend 20 minutes or so in there,"
00:02:07,00:02:08,"and then they come back out,"
00:02:08,00:02:10,"and then they all have to stand on a stage,"
00:02:10,00:02:12,"and a panel of judges, including a doctor,"
00:02:12,00:02:15,"comes in in specs, where all the bite locations are,"
00:02:15,00:02:18,and the one with the most bites wins.
00:02:18,00:02:21,And so the reason I think that this got a bit big
00:02:21,00:02:24,"was because there was a report in 2013, I believe,"
00:02:24,00:02:27,it was where they announced Irina was the winner that year.
00:02:27,00:02:29,She had 43 bites.
00:02:29,00:02:32,"And, you know, remember 2013 was the year of Zika?"
00:02:32,00:02:34,"You know, they were sort of saying,"
00:02:34,00:02:36,"""Oh, this is a bit bold, isn't it?"""
00:02:36,00:02:38,"Having, sending a child."
00:02:38,00:02:40,"But obviously they don't have Zika there, or at least."
00:02:40,00:02:42,- But well done to the person who just booed Zika.
00:02:42,00:02:45,I think we all can agree with that sentiment.
00:02:45,00:02:48,"- Your liberal credentials are impeccable, yeah."
00:02:48,00:02:49,"- That was actually in 2016,"
00:02:49,00:02:52,the one where Irina Ilyukhina won.
00:02:52,00:02:53,"- Oh, sorry, yes."
00:02:53,00:02:54,- She got 43 bites.
00:02:54,00:02:59,"The next year in 2017, the winner got more than 150 bites."
00:02:59,00:03:00,- Wow.
00:03:00,00:03:01,- She was nine years old.
00:03:01,00:03:03,- What?
00:03:03,00:03:06,Her social service has been informed about this.
00:03:06,00:03:09,"- Well, according to the local newspaper in Russia,"
00:03:09,00:03:11,they said that the nine-year-old winner
00:03:11,00:03:13,"did not even move her eyes,"
00:03:13,00:03:15,"'cause she wanted to not just have the most bites,"
00:03:15,00:03:17,but also be the most patient.
00:03:17,00:03:18,"- Oh, isn't that cute?"
00:03:18,00:03:19,- Are you all right?
00:03:19,00:03:21,"- No, there's no prize for that, is there?"
00:03:21,00:03:22,Jesus.
00:03:22,00:03:24,And what's with the berry picking?
00:03:24,00:03:25,It seems like it's just an excuse
00:03:25,00:03:28,to get small children to harvest berries for free.
00:03:28,00:03:30,And then you lure them in with the temptation of getting--
00:03:30,00:03:32,- With the promise of repeatedly being bitten.
00:03:32,00:03:33,- Exactly.
00:03:33,00:03:37,- But it's a three-day festival.
00:03:37,00:03:38,They all know why they're there.
00:03:38,00:03:40,There's lots of different things.
00:03:40,00:03:41,"- What, there are more events?"
00:03:41,00:03:42,"- There's more events, yeah."
00:03:42,00:03:44,You've got other events
00:03:44,00:03:48,that include most horrible mosquito squeak contest.
00:03:48,00:03:51,"I actually don't know how a mosquito squeaks,"
00:03:51,00:03:51,I've just realized.
00:03:51,00:03:52,"- Very, very high-pitched."
00:03:52,00:03:54,So you almost can't hear it.
00:03:54,00:03:54,You have heard it.
00:03:54,00:03:55,They go...
00:03:55,00:03:58,"- Dude, I always thought that was the wings."
00:03:58,00:04:00,"That's them, them, just going..."
00:04:00,00:04:01,"- Oh, that is the wings."
00:04:01,00:04:03,"- Oh, it is the wings, okay."
00:04:03,00:04:04,- They squeak with their wings.
00:04:04,00:04:06,- I'm not just going around going...
00:04:06,00:04:07,That's what I thought.
00:04:07,00:04:13,- And they have a few more things they have.
00:04:13,00:04:15,They have Mosquito Legs competition
00:04:15,00:04:17,to see who has the legs most like a mosquito.
00:04:17,00:04:18,- Okay.
00:04:18,00:04:21,- I don't think that means having six of them.
00:04:21,00:04:22,- Spindly.
00:04:22,00:04:23,"- Spindly, yeah."
00:04:23,00:04:24,It's like knobbly knees.
00:04:24,00:04:27,They have a comedy song competition
00:04:27,00:04:30,where you have to make a comedy song about mosquitoes.
00:04:30,00:04:32,"And they have a thing called Games of Winners,"
00:04:32,00:04:34,which are sports competitions for children
00:04:34,00:04:36,who've overcome serious illnesses.
00:04:36,00:04:36,- Right.
00:04:36,00:04:39,- Very serious and noble last one
00:04:39,00:04:42,on top of two ridiculous contests.
00:04:42,00:04:45,"I should have finished with the funny ones, shouldn't I?"
00:04:45,00:04:47,- Apparently Mosquito Legs is just a thing.
00:04:47,00:04:49,So they have other competitions like this around the world.
00:04:49,00:04:53,"In Texas, they have a similar Mosquito Festival in Clute."
00:04:53,00:04:55,"And they have a Mosquito Legs competition as well,"
00:04:55,00:04:57,separate for children and adults.
00:04:57,00:05:00,And the organizers are called the SWAT team.
00:05:00,00:05:01,- Very good.
00:05:01,00:05:02,"- Well, yeah."
00:05:02,00:05:04,"Other weird festivals, you know."
00:05:04,00:05:05,"There's a vaguely similar festival,"
00:05:05,00:05:09,the Bee Wearing Festival in the Hunan Province in China.
00:05:09,00:05:11,"A festival where you wear bees,"
00:05:11,00:05:12,"which is, I would say--"
00:05:12,00:05:14,- What do you mean by wearing bees?
00:05:14,00:05:16,"- Unlike having a bee beard, we talked about that one."
00:05:16,00:05:17,- Exactly.
00:05:17,00:05:19,And you do it by hanging the queen bee
00:05:19,00:05:20,"next to your face, basically."
00:05:20,00:05:21,"- Oh, that's what it is. - Another little bee cage."
00:05:21,00:05:23,"Yeah, and so they have a festival"
00:05:23,00:05:24,to see who can wear the most bees.
00:05:24,00:05:25,It's pretty impressive.
00:05:25,00:05:28,And the winner was Wang Dalin of the most recent one.
00:05:28,00:05:31,He got 27 kilos of bees to sit on his body.
00:05:31,00:05:33,- What was the seven kilos of bees?
00:05:33,00:05:34,"- Sorry, sorry, can I just stop you as well?"
00:05:34,00:05:36,"Wang Dalink, did you say that?"
00:05:36,00:05:37,- Yeah.
00:05:37,00:05:39,"- Dalink, it doesn't feel like a very--"
00:05:39,00:05:39,- Darlink.
00:05:39,00:05:40,- It's not Wang Dalink.
00:05:40,00:05:42,"It's not related to the Darlink family of Peter Pan,"
00:05:42,00:05:43,I don't think.
00:05:43,00:05:45,- Darlink.
00:05:45,00:05:46,- Darlink.
00:05:46,00:05:48,"- I got it, sorry. - Sorry, Darlink."
00:05:48,00:05:50,"Anyway, he got 27 kilos of bees to sit on him."
00:05:50,00:05:52,"- Sorry, I just love that there's people in China going,"
00:05:52,00:05:53,"""All right, Darlink."""
00:05:53,00:05:55,(laughing)
00:05:55,00:05:57,"- All right, Darlink, how are you doing?"
00:05:57,00:05:59,"Anyway, you're only allowed to wear shorts"
00:05:59,00:06:01,"and the rest of your naked, except for some goggles"
00:06:01,00:06:03,and plugs up the nose.
00:06:03,00:06:05,So that's permitted.
00:06:05,00:06:08,"- So are they not worried about any of the other orifices,"
00:06:08,00:06:10,"like ears, I'm thinking, like an ice?"
00:06:10,00:06:13,- I think we've mentioned before the most painful place
00:06:13,00:06:15,"to get stung is inside your nose, right?"
00:06:15,00:06:17,"So maybe you're only allowed, maybe you're given one plug."
00:06:17,00:06:19,"They say, you know, you put this where you choose."
00:06:19,00:06:20,- Yeah.
00:06:20,00:06:21,(laughing)
00:06:21,00:06:22,"It's a one nostril, I mean."
00:06:22,00:06:24,"- One nostril, save one nostril."
00:06:24,00:06:25,"- Right, wow."
00:06:25,00:06:26,What an interesting concept.
00:06:26,00:06:29,I wonder at what point when you're wearing so many bees
00:06:29,00:06:31,"that you keel over, that you're weighed down."
00:06:31,00:06:33,"- 'Cause 20 kilos is pretty heavy, it's like--"
00:06:33,00:06:34,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:06:34,00:06:36,"- Yeah, I guess that, I mean, they are sort of flying."
00:06:36,00:06:38,I'm not sure the extent to which they are sustaining--
00:06:38,00:06:39,- Keep themselves up.
00:06:39,00:06:42,"- Opposite question, then, at what point do you levitate"
00:06:42,00:06:47,when you have that many bees?
00:06:47,00:06:50,- Maybe that's what they're trying to do.
00:06:50,00:06:51,- There's a festival in Portugal
00:06:51,00:06:53,"in a town called Amarante, which I really like,"
00:06:53,00:06:55,"and it's a romantic festival,"
00:06:55,00:06:58,and it all centers around unmarried young people
00:06:58,00:07:00,exchanging phallic cakes.
00:07:00,00:07:03,And it's a really charming thing.
00:07:03,00:07:04,The whole town gets involved.
00:07:04,00:07:06,"You know, these grandmothers will be selling"
00:07:06,00:07:09,these massive Willy cakes stuffed with cream as well.
00:07:09,00:07:11,It's all really suggestive.
00:07:11,00:07:14,"And they were, this festival is a very,"
00:07:14,00:07:15,"it's quite an old one, but it was banned"
00:07:15,00:07:18,under the days of the dictatorship in Portugal.
00:07:18,00:07:21,And the cakes were kind of driven underground.
00:07:21,00:07:24,"But they were, I think they were secretly traded."
00:07:24,00:07:27,"And then in 1974, they had a revolution,"
00:07:27,00:07:30,and then they were liberated from not being able to--
00:07:30,00:07:32,"- When they were driven underground,"
00:07:32,00:07:33,was it like the Reformation?
00:07:33,00:07:35,"Did you have sort of priest holes,"
00:07:35,00:07:39,like cake holes where you retreat in your house
00:07:39,00:07:41,"and you do a little cake sermon, do we know,"
00:07:41,00:07:43,or did it just disappear?
00:07:43,00:07:44,- I don't know.
00:07:44,00:07:45,Maybe it hasn't been written down
00:07:45,00:07:46,because it's two secrets still.
00:07:46,00:07:49,But they are sold year round now.
00:07:49,00:07:52,So it's kind of been untethered from their original--
00:07:52,00:07:53,- Really?
00:07:53,00:07:55,"So in Portugal, you can get,"
00:07:55,00:07:57,"instead of hot cross buns, you get penises?"
00:07:57,00:07:58,No.
00:07:58,00:07:58,"- Well, you can get,"
00:07:58,00:08:00,as in you used to only be able to get a Willy cake
00:08:00,00:08:03,"at the right time of year, like a hot cross bun,"
00:08:03,00:08:06,"but now, in an arguable step forwards,"
00:08:06,00:08:08,you can get a hot cross bun or a penis cake all the time.
00:08:08,00:08:10,It's good.
00:08:10,00:08:14,- I like the idea of a phallus untethered from its origin.
00:08:14,00:08:16,- I think if you--
00:08:16,00:08:17,- If you attach enough bees to it.
00:08:17,00:08:21,- I was reading about a festival
00:08:21,00:08:22,which happened in Mexico.
00:08:22,00:08:24,"It's called San Juan de la Vega,"
00:08:24,00:08:27,"and it's been going for 300 years,"
00:08:27,00:08:30,and this is a festival where locals will attach
00:08:30,00:08:33,"a homemade explosive to the head of their sledgehammer,"
00:08:33,00:08:36,and then they will wap it into the road
00:08:36,00:08:39,"and let it explode in front of them,"
00:08:39,00:08:40,"and people watch that,"
00:08:40,00:08:43,"and the article I read said,"
00:08:43,00:08:44,"'cause there's so many people saying,"
00:08:44,00:08:46,"""Do you think we should stop the explosives"
00:08:46,00:08:48,"""on the sledgehammer slamming to the road?"
00:08:48,00:08:49,"""Bit of the festival?"""
00:08:49,00:08:51,"And they say, ""Absolutely not, 300 years."""
00:08:51,00:08:54,"And then the same article from 2020,"
00:08:54,00:08:57,"they said, ""43 people were injured this year."""
00:08:57,00:08:58,- Wow.
00:08:58,00:08:59,So it's got a high every year.
00:08:59,00:09:01,"- High injury rate, yeah."
00:09:01,00:09:02,- Is that in honor of something?
00:09:02,00:09:03,Did some saint explode?
00:09:03,00:09:04,"- Yeah, it was."
00:09:04,00:09:05,"No, no, it was."
00:09:05,00:09:07,There was someone who was supposedly
00:09:07,00:09:09,the Robin Hood of this area.
00:09:09,00:09:11,"In fact, the town is named after this person."
00:09:11,00:09:13,I don't think they exploded.
00:09:13,00:09:16,"I should have read it, really, the article further."
00:09:16,00:09:20,"- No, no, the mystery is better."
00:09:20,00:09:25,How far do you think you could throw an uncooked sausage?
00:09:27,00:09:28,- Ah.
00:09:28,00:09:30,"- Straight from the freezer, or is it?"
00:09:30,00:09:33,"- No, I think it's malleable, so it's been defrosted,"
00:09:33,00:09:35,"but it is wrapped in plastic, so you've got, you know."
00:09:35,00:09:38,- So is it different to a cooked sausage?
00:09:38,00:09:39,- Yes.
00:09:39,00:09:40,"- Yes, okay."
00:09:40,00:09:41,It's someone in the audience.
00:09:41,00:09:43,Someone in the audience leapt right in there.
00:09:43,00:09:44,- The voice of experience feels like
00:09:44,00:09:46,it's speaking from the audience.
00:09:46,00:09:49,- I reckon I could throw one into the circle from here.
00:09:49,00:09:50,- All right.
00:09:50,00:09:52,"- Do it, do it, do it!"
00:09:52,00:09:55,Let's all get the sausage we keep on our pockets out.
00:09:56,00:09:58,"Everyone, what do you think?"
00:09:58,00:10:00,We're just carrying raw sausages around with us.
00:10:00,00:10:04,- I reckon around 40 yards.
00:10:04,00:10:04,- 40 yards.
00:10:04,00:10:05,- Do what am I--
00:10:05,00:10:07,"- 120 feet, pretty good."
00:10:07,00:10:11,"- I am 20, it's 17 meters."
00:10:11,00:10:13,"Sorry, I don't know why I'm giving such a thought"
00:10:13,00:10:14,through the answer.
00:10:14,00:10:16,- Yards and answering meters.
00:10:16,00:10:18,"Dan, do you want to throw in furlongs, maybe?"
00:10:18,00:10:19,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:10:19,00:10:20,- Let's all make us nice and comparable.
00:10:20,00:10:21,- 20 leagues.
00:10:21,00:10:24,(laughing)
00:10:24,00:10:25,"- Well, I'll tell you, the record"
00:10:25,00:10:28,for throwing a standard raw
00:10:28,00:10:30,at the Harwich Essex Sausage Festival
00:10:30,00:10:34,"is 171 feet, which I think is very good."
00:10:34,00:10:35,- What did I say I could do?
00:10:35,00:10:36,"- You said 120 feet, not bad."
00:10:36,00:10:37,- Wow.
00:10:37,00:10:38,"- That's held by a man called Todd Rothwell,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,just to give him his due.
00:10:40,00:10:42,And that was apparently thrown under perfect conditions.
00:10:42,00:10:43,There was--
00:10:43,00:10:44,(laughing)
00:10:44,00:10:45,"- Was the wit like, wind assisted?"
00:10:45,00:10:47,"- I don't know about prevailing wind,"
00:10:47,00:10:49,"but the previous record was about 140 feet,"
00:10:49,00:10:50,"and that was held for years and years,"
00:10:50,00:10:51,and then he smashed through it.
00:10:51,00:10:53,"And they take it very seriously,"
00:10:53,00:10:54,"obviously not very seriously,"
00:10:54,00:10:56,"'cause it's not a very serious thing to do,"
00:10:56,00:10:59,but it's judged by a proper cricket umpire
00:10:59,00:11:00,to prevent any foul play.
00:11:00,00:11:01,- Okay.
00:11:01,00:11:02,- And there are sausage marshals
00:11:02,00:11:05,"who stand along, you know, sausage alley"
00:11:05,00:11:08,and observe the throws.
00:11:08,00:11:09,"- Oh, okay, to look for the throw itself."
00:11:09,00:11:10,"- You wouldn't, it's like,"
00:11:10,00:11:11,to stop people walking up to a sausage
00:11:11,00:11:13,and then just kicking it another few--
00:11:13,00:11:16,"- I just don't see how, if you're a cricket umpire,"
00:11:16,00:11:19,that job sort of transfers.
00:11:19,00:11:20,"I don't see what's special about it,"
00:11:20,00:11:23,unless there's loads of cheating Australians in this spot.
00:11:23,00:11:24,- I don't--
00:11:24,00:11:26,"- What, ow."
00:11:26,00:11:29,"- If you rub some sandpaper on the skin of the sausage,"
00:11:29,00:11:30,it will light.
00:11:30,00:11:31,- Nice.
00:11:31,00:11:33,"Guys, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:11:33,00:11:37,"- Oh, you can get tornadoes of mosquitoes."
00:11:37,00:11:38,Do you know that?
00:11:38,00:11:39,With millions of them.
00:11:39,00:11:41,"This is in Russia as well, in Kotakka."
00:11:41,00:11:43,So you can see videos of them online.
00:11:43,00:11:45,"There's millions and millions of them,"
00:11:45,00:11:47,"and they're going round and round, just like a tornado."
00:11:47,00:11:49,"And if you walk into them, like literally,"
00:11:49,00:11:51,"you're going for a second,"
00:11:51,00:11:53,and you're covered from head to toe in mosquitoes.
00:11:53,00:11:55,But you'd never get bitten.
00:11:55,00:11:56,Do you know why that is?
00:11:56,00:11:58,- They're dead.
00:11:58,00:12:00,- Dead? How are they flying?
00:12:00,00:12:04,- They've been picked up by a tornado.
00:12:04,00:12:04,I've got confused.
00:12:04,00:12:05,"- Got it, got it."
00:12:05,00:12:07,"- They're not dead, they're not dead, they're not dead."
00:12:07,00:12:08,- You're dead.
00:12:08,00:12:10,(audience laughing)
00:12:10,00:12:11,You can get this.
00:12:11,00:12:12,I know you can get this.
00:12:12,00:12:14,- They're all what?
00:12:14,00:12:16,- They're all males.
00:12:16,00:12:18,- They're all males.
00:12:18,00:12:20,"There are a few females there,"
00:12:20,00:12:23,"but these are all really, really horny males"
00:12:23,00:12:25,that are spinning around in a tornado
00:12:25,00:12:27,to attract the female in like a mating dance.
00:12:27,00:12:28,- Wow.
00:12:28,00:12:30,"- And eventually, you know, they'll have sex,"
00:12:30,00:12:31,"but in the meantime, if you walk in them,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,they won't bite you 'cause only females bite.
00:12:33,00:12:34,"- Well, that's so nice."
00:12:34,00:12:35,"So not only if they come towards you,"
00:12:35,00:12:36,"will they not bite you,"
00:12:36,00:12:39,"but it sort of means they fancy you, presumably."
00:12:39,00:12:41,- I think they'll be disappointed if...
00:12:41,00:12:43,"I mean, they might see my legs and go,"
00:12:43,00:12:44,"""They're mosquito legs."""
00:12:44,00:12:46,(audience laughing)
00:12:46,00:12:47,"- I need to move us on, guys."
00:12:47,00:12:49,We need to go on to our next fact.
00:12:49,00:12:51,"It is time for fact number two,"
00:12:51,00:12:54,and that is Anna.
00:12:54,00:12:57,- My fact this week is that pigs used to walk to market
00:12:57,00:12:59,wearing woolen socks.
00:12:59,00:13:01,(audience laughing)
00:13:01,00:13:04,This is pigs when they were being walked to market.
00:13:04,00:13:08,"So they would be drove, drove and driven."
00:13:08,00:13:10,"You know, like cattle driving, pig driving."
00:13:10,00:13:13,It's when people would hire someone
00:13:13,00:13:15,to take the animals from their farm
00:13:15,00:13:17,and walk them all the way to the nearest market
00:13:17,00:13:18,to flog them.
00:13:18,00:13:19,And it was a huge deal in Britain
00:13:19,00:13:21,"until the Industrial Revolution,"
00:13:21,00:13:23,"in Ireland until the Industrial Revolution,"
00:13:23,00:13:25,in Australia and America after it.
00:13:25,00:13:27,But they had to walk huge distances
00:13:27,00:13:29,and you had to present your pigs at the other end
00:13:29,00:13:30,in good condition.
00:13:30,00:13:32,And so you protected their feet.
00:13:32,00:13:35,"And to do that, they used to put little socks on them,"
00:13:35,00:13:36,but with leather soles.
00:13:36,00:13:38,"So they'd keep them warm, protect them,"
00:13:38,00:13:42,"and then they wouldn't graze their hooves on the path,"
00:13:42,00:13:44,and then they killed them and they got there.
00:13:44,00:13:45,(audience laughing)
00:13:45,00:13:47,"- And presumably they killed a sheep for their wool,"
00:13:47,00:13:50,"maybe not killed, but also the cow for the leather."
00:13:50,00:13:53,"- Yeah, it's three animals in one,"
00:13:53,00:13:54,you're getting for your money.
00:13:54,00:13:58,"- Yeah, droving is very cool stuff."
00:13:58,00:13:59,(audience laughing)
00:13:59,00:14:00,"No, I--"
00:14:00,00:14:01,- Buckle in.
00:14:01,00:14:02,(audience laughing)
00:14:02,00:14:06,"- I didn't know about droving at all, or drovers."
00:14:06,00:14:09,And it was a career that was very well respected.
00:14:09,00:14:11,"So I really like this, in Wales,"
00:14:11,00:14:13,you would have lots of cattle being driven to market.
00:14:13,00:14:16,And they would often walk from Wales to London.
00:14:16,00:14:18,And there would be 12 drovers who had 300 cows
00:14:18,00:14:19,"between them, right?"
00:14:19,00:14:20,Pretty demanding stuff.
00:14:20,00:14:24,The animals which kept the cows in line were corgis.
00:14:24,00:14:27,"That was the original use of the corgis, adorable."
00:14:27,00:14:28,- They must have been fucking knackered
00:14:28,00:14:30,by this time they got to London.
00:14:30,00:14:32,"- Little legs, I know, but they were low enough"
00:14:32,00:14:34,to avoid being kicked in the head by a cow.
00:14:34,00:14:36,So that was their superpower.
00:14:36,00:14:39,"Okay, get this, they get to London,"
00:14:39,00:14:41,"the cows are sold, whatever."
00:14:41,00:14:43,"The humans, drovers, and the corgis"
00:14:43,00:14:46,"would then travel back to Wales, separately."
00:14:46,00:14:48,The corgis would go a couple of days ahead
00:14:48,00:14:49,because they just knew the way home.
00:14:49,00:14:51,- With who? - Who was droving the corgis?
00:14:51,00:14:53,- Nobody. - The queen.
00:14:53,00:14:55,(audience laughing)
00:14:55,00:14:57,"- Genuinely, nobody, nobody was..."
00:14:57,00:14:58,- They just walked back on their own?
00:14:58,00:15:00,- The corgis just remembered their way home and went.
00:15:00,00:15:01,- Like a homing pigeon?
00:15:01,00:15:02,- Like a homing dog.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"And they were just, like, and the drovers"
00:15:04,00:15:06,had to prepay the dog's food and accommodation
00:15:06,00:15:07,in the pubs along the way.
00:15:07,00:15:10,- They had nowhere to stop for the night.
00:15:10,00:15:12,(audience laughing)
00:15:12,00:15:13,- It's true.
00:15:13,00:15:15,- They don't know which pubs to stop at.
00:15:15,00:15:17,"- Look, I read this, I read this."
00:15:17,00:15:20,- They walk in on two legs in a waistcoat
00:15:20,00:15:22,"and say, ""Yeah, yeah, you put 200 quid behind the bar."""
00:15:22,00:15:23,"Yeah, he definitely did."
00:15:23,00:15:26,- Three corgis in one waistcoat.
00:15:26,00:15:27,- Is that why there's never any humans
00:15:27,00:15:30,in those poker paintings with all the dogs?
00:15:30,00:15:31,(audience laughing)
00:15:31,00:15:32,- Absolutely nonsense.
00:15:32,00:15:34,"- It's true, it's true."
00:15:34,00:15:36,- Unbelievable. - You can't believe it.
00:15:36,00:15:37,- I read that when the drovers
00:15:37,00:15:39,"would come through the countryside,"
00:15:39,00:15:41,I read that the noise that they would make
00:15:41,00:15:44,"was neither shouting, nor calling,"
00:15:44,00:15:47,"nor crying, nor singing, nor hallowing,"
00:15:47,00:15:49,nor anything else.
00:15:49,00:15:51,"- Sorry, I just didn't say anything."
00:15:51,00:15:52,- No. (audience laughing)
00:15:52,00:15:54,"I think the idea was they would go,"
00:15:54,00:15:56,(growling)
00:15:56,00:15:58,"like that, just make a whole load of noise, right?"
00:15:58,00:16:01,"And you would hear them coming from miles and miles away,"
00:16:01,00:16:04,just this holler-balloo of noise.
00:16:04,00:16:06,And what would you do if you're a local farmer?
00:16:06,00:16:08,You would hide all of your cows
00:16:08,00:16:09,and all of your cattle.
00:16:09,00:16:11,And the reason being that there was so many
00:16:11,00:16:13,of these cattle coming down the road
00:16:13,00:16:15,"that if your cattle got stuck in there,"
00:16:15,00:16:17,you'd never get it out again.
00:16:17,00:16:19,And they'd end up taking it.
00:16:19,00:16:21,- And they'd just follow like a congerline kind of thing.
00:16:21,00:16:22,They would just--
00:16:22,00:16:23,(audience laughing)
00:16:23,00:16:24,"- Yeah, like a congerline."
00:16:24,00:16:25,- Wow.
00:16:25,00:16:26,- That's very interesting.
00:16:26,00:16:27,The reason I started reading about this
00:16:27,00:16:30,is 'cause my great-great-grandfather was a drover.
00:16:30,00:16:33,"And we are all, on that side of the family,"
00:16:33,00:16:35,irritatingly loud and shrill.
00:16:35,00:16:36,"- It all makes sense though, isn't it?"
00:16:36,00:16:37,- That's where it came from.
00:16:37,00:16:39,"- What was that noise you made, James?"
00:16:39,00:16:41,(James grunting)
00:16:41,00:16:41,- Oh yeah.
00:16:41,00:16:43,"- Yes, they always had five bottles of wine"
00:16:43,00:16:44,by that point as well.
00:16:44,00:16:46,(audience laughing)
00:16:46,00:16:47,"- Some Scottish trovers, this is a cool thing."
00:16:47,00:16:50,The diet would be very limited when you're on the road.
00:16:50,00:16:52,"So the diet would mostly consist of oats, whisky,"
00:16:52,00:16:54,"and onions, I don't know, they're proportioned."
00:16:54,00:16:57,"But like, there wasn't much variety in the diet."
00:16:57,00:17:00,But sometimes they would have a little bonus meal
00:17:00,00:17:03,because they would drain some of a cow's blood en route
00:17:03,00:17:05,and then mix it with oatmeal to make black pudding.
00:17:05,00:17:06,"- Oh, would they?"
00:17:06,00:17:09,"- But then the cow would kind of stay alive, right?"
00:17:09,00:17:11,"They would just do, that's quite cool, isn't it?"
00:17:11,00:17:14,"It's like, it's almost, it's not vegan, I wouldn't say."
00:17:14,00:17:15,(audience laughing)
00:17:15,00:17:16,- But at least you're not--
00:17:16,00:17:19,"- Oh, it's, how is your restaurant going, James?"
00:17:19,00:17:21,(audience laughing)
00:17:21,00:17:22,But at least it's sustainable.
00:17:22,00:17:24,"- It's sustainable, yeah, yeah."
00:17:24,00:17:26,I still think the cow's looking at the oat supply
00:17:26,00:17:28,"dwindling, going, ""Oh, fuck."""
00:17:28,00:17:31,(audience laughing)
00:17:31,00:17:33,"They also, they got quite bored, I think,"
00:17:33,00:17:34,drovers on the walk.
00:17:34,00:17:36,'Cause it was very slow.
00:17:36,00:17:38,"Like, pigs could only go about 10 miles a day."
00:17:38,00:17:40,"And like, pigs are very unwieldy."
00:17:40,00:17:41,They were the worst.
00:17:41,00:17:42,They never stuck together.
00:17:42,00:17:44,"Every time they saw mud, they rolled around in it."
00:17:44,00:17:46,"- Taking the socks off, my man."
00:17:46,00:17:47,(audience laughing)
00:17:47,00:17:50,It's pig with three fucking socks on.
00:17:50,00:17:52,"Well, now we all have to go back, don't we?"
00:17:52,00:17:53,(audience laughing)
00:17:53,00:17:55,Because Vinny's lost his sock.
00:17:55,00:17:56,(audience laughing)
00:17:56,00:17:58,"- Right, it was tedious work."
00:17:58,00:18:01,"Apparently what they did was, they got into knitting,"
00:18:01,00:18:03,which had the obviously double bonus
00:18:03,00:18:05,of being able to knit the pig's new socks.
00:18:05,00:18:09,"But some of them, there's a really nice description"
00:18:09,00:18:10,of these huge drovers.
00:18:10,00:18:12,'Cause they were the toughest of the tough guys.
00:18:12,00:18:15,And they often had a bit of a criminally background.
00:18:15,00:18:17,"Often were into stealing, livestock,"
00:18:17,00:18:19,sort of alongside the droving.
00:18:19,00:18:21,"And like, quite intimidating guys."
00:18:21,00:18:24,"And the description of these big, wild, hairy men"
00:18:24,00:18:25,is how it's described.
00:18:25,00:18:28,Definitely knitting away a little hat for their niece
00:18:28,00:18:29,at the back of a bunch of cows.
00:18:29,00:18:30,- So cool.
00:18:30,00:18:30,That's really cool.
00:18:30,00:18:33,- Did you hear about the terrible knitters of Dent?
00:18:33,00:18:34,(audience laughing)
00:18:34,00:18:36,- It's a Yorkshire village called Dent.
00:18:36,00:18:38,And it was a place which was famed for his knitting.
00:18:38,00:18:41,"People needed to supplement their income, very poor area."
00:18:41,00:18:42,And so they were called terrible
00:18:42,00:18:44,because of how terribly fast they could do it.
00:18:44,00:18:45,"You know, kind of terrifying."
00:18:45,00:18:46,"- Oh, really?"
00:18:46,00:18:47,"- Like awesome, that kind of thing."
00:18:47,00:18:48,"- Oh, God, he made me a shit job."
00:18:48,00:18:50,- I would say that's quite bad branding.
00:18:50,00:18:51,"- Yeah, it is."
00:18:51,00:18:53,"- If you're selling your socks and you say,"
00:18:53,00:18:55,"these are terrible socks, but by terrible,"
00:18:55,00:18:57,"I mean, I do them terribly quickly."
00:18:57,00:18:58,(audience laughing)
00:18:58,00:19:00,"- But yeah, all the guys in Dent would knit."
00:19:00,00:19:02,"And they had a thing called a knitting stick, right?"
00:19:02,00:19:06,Where you stick in your belt and it kind of anchors the wool.
00:19:06,00:19:09,So then you can knit with one hand as you're walking along.
00:19:09,00:19:09,Right?
00:19:09,00:19:11,Some people would knit with one hand
00:19:11,00:19:13,and churn butter with the other hand.
00:19:13,00:19:14,- What?
00:19:14,00:19:15,How cool is that?
00:19:15,00:19:16,- Who's holding the butterpale?
00:19:16,00:19:18,You're balancing that on your toes?
00:19:18,00:19:19,- I don't know.
00:19:19,00:19:20,- Wow.
00:19:20,00:19:21,- That's amazing.
00:19:21,00:19:22,And they're socks that these guys had.
00:19:22,00:19:25,The other famous thing is that they used to put tar
00:19:25,00:19:27,"on the feet of geese, didn't they?"
00:19:27,00:19:28,- Yes.
00:19:28,00:19:28,- That's quite a famous one.
00:19:28,00:19:31,So they would take the geese to London
00:19:31,00:19:33,"from possibly from Norfolk, somewhere like that,"
00:19:33,00:19:36,and they would put tar and sand on the feet of the geese.
00:19:36,00:19:38,"And then when they would walk all the way,"
00:19:38,00:19:39,it wouldn't hurt their feet
00:19:39,00:19:41,and they would be much better to sell.
00:19:41,00:19:44,"On specialist aggregates.com,"
00:19:44,00:19:46,"which I'm not sure whether they're exactly right,"
00:19:46,00:19:50,"but according to them, the current surfaces on roads,"
00:19:50,00:19:53,which is bitumen and like some little bits of aggregate
00:19:53,00:19:56,"as well, that directly comes from this,"
00:19:56,00:19:59,putting the tar on the feet of geese.
00:19:59,00:20:01,"That was invented, then this was invented,"
00:20:01,00:20:02,and then the road was invented.
00:20:02,00:20:05,"So without the geese having tar boots,"
00:20:05,00:20:07,we wouldn't have roads today.
00:20:07,00:20:07,- Wow.
00:20:07,00:20:08,- No way.
00:20:08,00:20:09,- Apparently.
00:20:09,00:20:10,- Oh my.
00:20:10,00:20:12,- According to specialist aggregates.com.
00:20:12,00:20:13,(laughing)
00:20:13,00:20:18,"- A website, I don't even understand the name of."
00:20:18,00:20:19,- Hang on a minute.
00:20:19,00:20:20,- But I love it.
00:20:20,00:20:21,- But it's got the word specialist in it.
00:20:21,00:20:22,"- Yeah, it sounds like they know what they're talking about."
00:20:22,00:20:23,They're specialists and they do aggregates.
00:20:23,00:20:25,"That's like, that's big stuff."
00:20:25,00:20:26,- Dot com as well.
00:20:26,00:20:27,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:20:27,00:20:28,- It's not dotco.uk or something.
00:20:28,00:20:29,"- Oh well, yeah."
00:20:29,00:20:30,- It's a big dog.
00:20:30,00:20:32,- It's a big dog of the domains.
00:20:32,00:20:33,- Yeah.
00:20:33,00:20:34,"- So Tom, these specialist aggregates are saying,"
00:20:34,00:20:38,it was only when we saw tar on the feet of geese
00:20:38,00:20:39,(laughing)
00:20:39,00:20:41,"and realised it wasn't urgent that we thought,"
00:20:41,00:20:43,let's cover everyone's feet in that way.
00:20:43,00:20:44,That's unsustainable.
00:20:44,00:20:45,We'll have to peel the tar off every day.
00:20:45,00:20:46,Let's just cover the roads in that.
00:20:46,00:20:48,- That would have been a way more sustainable way
00:20:48,00:20:49,for us all to do it.
00:20:49,00:20:50,"- No, 'cause you don't want tar on your feet"
00:20:50,00:20:51,the whole time.
00:20:51,00:20:52,"- No, no, no, no."
00:20:52,00:20:52,"You're going out in the morning,"
00:20:52,00:20:54,you just dip in the tar bath.
00:20:54,00:20:55,Like you just trend through that.
00:20:55,00:20:56,"Like at the entrance of a swimming pool,"
00:20:56,00:20:59,we have that little bit to walk through to clean your feet.
00:20:59,00:21:00,Everyone just walks through that on the way.
00:21:00,00:21:02,We never bothered inventing the road
00:21:02,00:21:03,'cause everyone's wearing their own road on their feet.
00:21:03,00:21:07,"- You'd have to cover all your car in tar, wouldn't you?"
00:21:07,00:21:09,"- Yeah, I'm not sure how the wheels actually work."
00:21:09,00:21:11,(laughing)
00:21:11,00:21:13,"- It was tar spray and chip,"
00:21:13,00:21:16,which is a process that they used on the feet of the geese.
00:21:16,00:21:19,And that is exactly the same process as we used to make.
00:21:19,00:21:20,"- I'm gonna go out on a limb and say,"
00:21:20,00:21:24,we would have managed the whole tarring roads thing
00:21:24,00:21:25,without even the geese.
00:21:25,00:21:28,So I'm gonna keep eating one at Christmas.
00:21:28,00:21:30,"- Look, I would criticize that, but to be honest,"
00:21:30,00:21:32,I'm looking for a bit of support for my corgis thing.
00:21:32,00:21:35,And I'm willing to say I buy it.
00:21:35,00:21:36,"- Have you guys heard,"
00:21:36,00:21:38,it's quite a famous pub in Scotland called The Drowers Inn.
00:21:38,00:21:39,"- Yeah, I've stayed in that."
00:21:39,00:21:40,- You've stayed in the Drowers Inn?
00:21:40,00:21:42,"- On my honeymoon, I did."
00:21:42,00:21:43,- You're kidding.
00:21:43,00:21:43,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:21:43,00:21:45,"Just, I spent the whole time telling my wife"
00:21:45,00:21:47,about the history of droving.
00:21:47,00:21:48,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:21:48,00:21:50,In between fending off corgis from the door.
00:21:50,00:21:52,(laughing)
00:21:52,00:21:55,"This is in Loch Loughman in Scotland, right?"
00:21:55,00:21:56,"It's near Loch Loughman, yeah."
00:21:56,00:21:58,"- Yeah, so tell me if you experience this."
00:21:58,00:21:59,- It is a ghost.
00:21:59,00:22:01,- It's one of the most haunted places in-
00:22:01,00:22:02,- That's why we stayed there.
00:22:02,00:22:03,- What?
00:22:03,00:22:04,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:04,00:22:06,"- Ow, it's haunted by a ghost drover called Angus."
00:22:06,00:22:11,"And Angus, so he was killed as part of his droving."
00:22:11,00:22:14,His droving group of animals were stolen
00:22:14,00:22:16,and they supposedly killed him.
00:22:16,00:22:18,"But there's all these reports from the inn where they say,"
00:22:18,00:22:20,like someone said that they fell asleep one night
00:22:20,00:22:21,"and when they woke up in the morning,"
00:22:21,00:22:23,their camera was sitting in a different spot.
00:22:23,00:22:25,"And then when they looked in the camera,"
00:22:25,00:22:28,there was all these photos of them sleeping in the bed.
00:22:28,00:22:29,- That was not proof.
00:22:29,00:22:30,- That was when I was there.
00:22:30,00:22:32,(laughing)
00:22:32,00:22:34,- That's just proof of a pervert.
00:22:34,00:22:36,It's not a ghost.
00:22:36,00:22:39,"- What pervert goes in, doesn't bring a camera,"
00:22:39,00:22:42,"hoping that someone else has left the camera,"
00:22:42,00:22:44,takes the photos and then leaves them.
00:22:44,00:22:46,(laughing)
00:22:46,00:22:47,- A very specialist one.
00:22:47,00:22:49,(laughing)
00:22:49,00:22:50,- That's amazing.
00:22:50,00:22:51,"Yeah, I saw it."
00:22:51,00:22:52,What was he called?
00:22:52,00:22:53,Angus. - Angus.
00:22:53,00:22:55,"- Yeah, I saw him and he said,"
00:22:55,00:22:57,that thing about geese is definitely true.
00:22:57,00:22:59,(laughing)
00:22:59,00:23:03,- Any word on the corgis?
00:23:03,00:23:07,- We've got to move on very soon.
00:23:07,00:23:09,I've got to think about transporting animals
00:23:09,00:23:10,from one place to the other.
00:23:10,00:23:11,"And I know the four of us know this,"
00:23:11,00:23:15,but I do love how they often have to transport rhinos
00:23:15,00:23:16,in Africa to different places.
00:23:16,00:23:19,"And the way, the best way that they've worked out to do it"
00:23:19,00:23:21,is to sedate the rhinos.
00:23:21,00:23:24,"And then, carry them, tie up their legs"
00:23:24,00:23:27,and carry them upside down by helicopter
00:23:27,00:23:30,and fly them to the destination they go to.
00:23:30,00:23:32,So it could be the case that if you're in certain parts
00:23:32,00:23:34,"of Africa, if you look to the sky,"
00:23:34,00:23:38,there will be an upside down rhino flying past you.
00:23:38,00:23:40,"And the article I was reading,"
00:23:40,00:23:41,they were transporting 10 rhinos.
00:23:41,00:23:44,So 10 rhinos were going past in the sky.
00:23:44,00:23:45,"I'm not sure at the same time,"
00:23:45,00:23:47,but you would have seen 10 rhinos during the day.
00:23:47,00:23:49,And one quite nice thing that they do
00:23:49,00:23:52,"as part of the process is, so the rhino is sedated,"
00:23:52,00:23:54,but they blindfold the rhino
00:23:54,00:23:56,"because just in case it wakes up mid-trip,"
00:23:56,00:23:58,"they go, ""What?!"""
00:23:58,00:24:01,(LAUGHTER)
00:24:01,00:24:03,"It's just a little sweet touch to make sure,"
00:24:03,00:24:07,"at least it's like, ""Ah, OK, some sort of prank is going on."""
00:24:07,00:24:09,It is amazing.
00:24:09,00:24:10,It's not that common.
00:24:10,00:24:12,"If you do take a safari just to see that,"
00:24:12,00:24:13,it's not guaranteed.
00:24:13,00:24:15,"But they tried it with bees first, didn't they?"
00:24:15,00:24:17,But you need too many to lift them up.
00:24:17,00:24:20,That's the thing.
00:24:20,00:24:22,"We need to move on to our next fact, guys."
00:24:22,00:24:24,"It is time for fact number three,"
00:24:24,00:24:26,and that is Andy.
00:24:26,00:24:29,"My fact is that when hosting parties,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,singer Dean Martin would sometimes ring the police
00:24:31,00:24:33,pretending to be an angry neighbour
00:24:33,00:24:36,so that they would ask his guests to go home instead of him.
00:24:36,00:24:38,(LAUGHTER)
00:24:38,00:24:39,So good.
00:24:39,00:24:41,What a genius.
00:24:41,00:24:43,You know what? When you sent this...
00:24:43,00:24:44,(CHEERING)
00:24:44,00:24:46,"When you sent this back round,"
00:24:46,00:24:48,"the first thing I thought is, ""I bet Andy's going to do this."""
00:24:48,00:24:50,100%. I don't have guests.
00:24:50,00:24:52,But... (LAUGHTER)
00:24:52,00:24:55,"This was... It's been documented in a few places,"
00:24:55,00:24:56,"so it was in a documentary about him,"
00:24:56,00:24:59,and his son wrote a book about growing up being Dean Martin's son.
00:24:59,00:25:03,"Dean Martin, an incredibly famous mid-20th-century singer,"
00:25:03,00:25:06,"member of the Rat Pack, and he was very reserved."
00:25:06,00:25:07,"Actually, he had this..."
00:25:07,00:25:09,"He gave the impression of being a very sociable,"
00:25:09,00:25:11,"heavy drinker, great party guy."
00:25:11,00:25:13,"He really wasn't. His wife was very sociable,"
00:25:13,00:25:14,and they would have a lot of parties.
00:25:14,00:25:18,"And Dean Martin wanted to be up in bed, basically."
00:25:18,00:25:21,"Yeah, apparently, I read that he often wanted to play golf in the morning"
00:25:21,00:25:24,"and so would get an early night, which really endeared me to him."
00:25:24,00:25:27,Yeah. This is the kind of guy we like. Yeah.
00:25:27,00:25:30,"Well, I think he was... We say that he didn't drink that much,"
00:25:30,00:25:31,and that was the impression.
00:25:31,00:25:32,"We've mentioned on the show before,"
00:25:32,00:25:34,"Dean Martin used to have his own TV show,"
00:25:34,00:25:36,"and he would constantly have a drink in his hand,"
00:25:36,00:25:37,like a whiskey or something.
00:25:37,00:25:39,"And actually, it was apple juice,"
00:25:39,00:25:43,because it was part of his stick that he would be drunk on stage.
00:25:43,00:25:45,But he was someone who did drink a lot.
00:25:45,00:25:48,"Like, his license plate to one of his cars was drunky,"
00:25:48,00:25:50,so it had a Y at the end of it.
00:25:50,00:25:52,That's just asking for trouble from the police.
00:25:52,00:25:53,"Yeah. Well, it definitely did,"
00:25:53,00:25:55,"when he had to change it to another car,"
00:25:55,00:25:58,because he crashed that car when he was drink-driving and was arrested.
00:25:58,00:26:01,"OK, I'm not saying he never had a drink. It's true."
00:26:01,00:26:04,"But he did. You know, he was a lot more reserved than the impression he gave."
00:26:04,00:26:06,"And basically, the story is, one night,"
00:26:06,00:26:08,that his wife was having yet another party.
00:26:08,00:26:11,"He was upstairs in his pyjamas, just wanting the noise to stop."
00:26:11,00:26:13,"And so he phoned the police and complained,"
00:26:13,00:26:15,"and the police turned up at the door, and they said,"
00:26:15,00:26:17,"""Look, we're sorry we've had a complaint from the neighbours."""
00:26:17,00:26:19,It happened again a few weeks later.
00:26:19,00:26:21,"He phoned the police and put on a voice, said, ""I'm a neighbour."""
00:26:21,00:26:23,"His wife started getting suspicious,"
00:26:23,00:26:25,because the neighbours lived about two miles away.
00:26:25,00:26:29,"They had a big home and a big property, and, like,"
00:26:29,00:26:30,were you hearing that much noise?
00:26:30,00:26:33,"Anyway, it happened again a few weeks after this."
00:26:33,00:26:34,"And he phoned up and said,"
00:26:34,00:26:37,"""Oh, I'm a neighbour of Dean Martins, and he's having a party."""
00:26:37,00:26:38,"And the police just said,"
00:26:38,00:26:40,"""OK, Mr. Martins, we'll be right over."""
00:26:41,00:26:44,"He was really reserved to Jean Martin, who was his first wife."
00:26:44,00:26:47,"She said that when she first met him, it was love at first sight."
00:26:47,00:26:49,"They got married really quickly,"
00:26:49,00:26:52,"and she said that she'd married him, knowing nothing about him."
00:26:52,00:26:54,"And when they divorced 23 years later,"
00:26:54,00:26:56,she still knew nothing about him.
00:26:56,00:26:57,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:26:57,00:27:00,- Except that he hated parties. - Yeah.
00:27:00,00:27:02,"I'd say, on a personal level, as a kid,"
00:27:02,00:27:04,I grew up on Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis movies.
00:27:04,00:27:06,And he was so cool.
00:27:06,00:27:08,"Like, he was part of the Ramp Act,"
00:27:08,00:27:11,"which was Frank Sinatra, was Sammy Davis Jr."
00:27:11,00:27:15,They were this group of crooning singers who also acted
00:27:15,00:27:17,"and had these mafia ties, and they used to do Las Vegas."
00:27:17,00:27:19,- Cool. - Yeah.
00:27:19,00:27:20,"But they were seeing that at the time,"
00:27:20,00:27:23,and Dean was seen as the coolest person within that.
00:27:23,00:27:27,And part of his cool was that he was just an incredibly lazy guy.
00:27:27,00:27:29,"So he never used to do rehearsals for the show that he did,"
00:27:29,00:27:31,which was a weekly show.
00:27:31,00:27:33,He would have a stand-in do every rehearsal.
00:27:33,00:27:34,"This was part of his contract,"
00:27:34,00:27:36,"for which he was paid tens of millions,"
00:27:36,00:27:39,and he would just rock up and just do the lines on the night
00:27:39,00:27:41,and then leave before the show was even done
00:27:41,00:27:45,"to get home to be boring as fuck, as you pointed out."
00:27:45,00:27:48,"His producer said, ""When Dean walks through the studio floor"
00:27:48,00:27:51,"""on the morning of the show, he doesn't know what he's going to sing,"
00:27:51,00:27:54,"""what he's going to say, who the guest stars are going to be."
00:27:54,00:27:56,"""And it reminded me of working with you, Dan."""
00:27:56,00:28:01,"- Cool guy. - Yeah, cool."
00:28:01,00:28:04,Heavy mafia ties is what I'm trying to imply.
00:28:04,00:28:08,"There's an Italian word for this called a menefligismo,"
00:28:08,00:28:10,"which I have probably mispronounced,"
00:28:10,00:28:12,which basically means I don't give a damn.
00:28:12,00:28:16,"I don't give a damnism, which is what he did, which sounded a bit cocky."
00:28:16,00:28:18,But he admitted it himself.
00:28:18,00:28:22,"He said, ""I can just about carry a tune, but I'm not really a good singer."""
00:28:22,00:28:25,We crew members just get by on being lazy and painless to listen to.
00:28:25,00:28:28,"This is how lazy he was. He did a movie called The Caddy,"
00:28:28,00:28:31,"and in The Caddy he sang a song that Capitol Records said,"
00:28:31,00:28:33,"""We want to re-record this because we want to release it."
00:28:33,00:28:34,"""We think it's a hit."""
00:28:34,00:28:36,"And he just went, ""I don't want to do that."""
00:28:36,00:28:38,"And they were like, ""Please, we think it's a hit."""
00:28:38,00:28:39,"He said, ""I don't want to do that."""
00:28:39,00:28:43,"So Capitol Records just had to go into the movies recording that he did,"
00:28:43,00:28:45,"take that and release it,"
00:28:45,00:28:47,"and that song was That's Amore,"
00:28:47,00:28:50,which went on to be his biggest hit and sold millions of copies.
00:28:50,00:28:52,He wasn't interested.
00:28:52,00:28:55,"When you don't give a shit about your biggest hit, That's Amore."
00:29:01,00:29:05,"I think we're a bit harsh about him being so reserved and antisocial and stuff,"
00:29:05,00:29:08,"because I think the reason is, or one of the main reasons,"
00:29:08,00:29:12,is that he didn't speak any English until he was about five or six years old.
00:29:12,00:29:14,"He was brought up in an Italian family,"
00:29:14,00:29:17,"and so he was never really confident in his English,"
00:29:17,00:29:19,and when he would have conversations with people
00:29:19,00:29:22,who would often feel like he didn't really know what to say and stuff like that.
00:29:22,00:29:23,"Yeah, that's true."
00:29:23,00:29:28,"There's another nice thing about him, which is, again, a mark of him being reserved,"
00:29:28,00:29:31,"which is he and Frank Sinatra were in Las Vegas,"
00:29:31,00:29:33,and they were having a great time.
00:29:33,00:29:37,"Frank Sinatra was surrounded by foxy ladies at the blackjack table, whatever."
00:29:37,00:29:41,The rest of them were corgis that were stopping along the way.
00:29:41,00:29:44,"A load of corgis around, and Dean Martin went to bed because,"
00:29:44,00:29:46,"as James pointed out, he was playing golf the next morning,"
00:29:46,00:29:48,wanted to get a good night's sleep.
00:29:48,00:29:52,The story is that Sinatra gave a call girl a thousand dollars to go upstairs
00:29:52,00:29:54,"to give Dean a good time,"
00:29:54,00:29:58,and Dean then gave the call girl two thousand dollars to just go downstairs
00:29:58,00:30:00,and say he had been amazing.
00:30:00,00:30:05,"Was that in the, could have been in the Sands Hotel,"
00:30:05,00:30:07,which they were particularly famous for staying here.
00:30:07,00:30:11,"There's just the Rat Pack Hotel that Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin,"
00:30:11,00:30:13,"the rest of the Rat Pack stayed in,"
00:30:13,00:30:16,"and they caused various scandals there,"
00:30:16,00:30:18,"mostly Frank Sinatra behaving badly, I think."
00:30:18,00:30:20,"One night he was served mushrooms in his meal,"
00:30:20,00:30:22,"and he didn't want mushrooms in his meal,"
00:30:22,00:30:26,"so he tipped the entire meal over his own head, which I quite like."
00:30:26,00:30:29,"And then he started, he chased the waiter into the kitchen shouting,"
00:30:29,00:30:31,"""I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover!"""
00:30:31,00:30:33,Terrifying.
00:30:33,00:30:36,"I don't know, he obviously doesn't hate mushrooms as much as me,"
00:30:36,00:30:38,"because I can imagine chasing the waiter and stuff,"
00:30:38,00:30:41,"but pouring it over your own head, that would be awful."
00:30:41,00:30:44,"Yeah, well maybe you'd go one step further."
00:30:44,00:30:47,"You might have done actually what he did, which is eventually get kicked out,"
00:30:47,00:30:51,because he had accrued so many gambling debts that he had to leave.
00:30:51,00:30:54,"So he climbed onto one of the tables, started screaming abuse at everyone,"
00:30:54,00:30:58,"threw a chair at the casino boss, who then punched him in the face,"
00:30:58,00:31:02,and then apparently he exited the hotel by driving a golf cart through the window.
00:31:02,00:31:04,Wow.
00:31:04,00:31:06,Sounds like me.
00:31:06,00:31:09,"So he was a shoplifter as well, wasn't he?"
00:31:09,00:31:12,"And apparently what he would do is he would go to a clothes shop,"
00:31:12,00:31:14,"and he would buy loads and loads and loads of stuff,"
00:31:14,00:31:17,"but then he would steal a couple of things,"
00:31:17,00:31:20,"and he would be like, ""Well, they don't mind, because I'm spending so much money,"
00:31:20,00:31:22,"but he just wanted the thrill of stealing some stuff."""
00:31:22,00:31:27,"When you walk from the till for a bit of a thrill, that's a moray."
00:31:27,00:31:32,It was less applause that time.
00:31:32,00:31:34,"Yeah, I think everyone saw me..."
00:31:34,00:31:37,"Have you ever heard the phrase ""diminishing returns""?"
00:31:37,00:31:41,Everyone saw me slowly approaching the goal line on that one from a distance.
00:31:41,00:31:44,Is he going to get there?
00:31:44,00:31:47,"Shoplifting would have been a particular challenge for him,"
00:31:47,00:31:49,because he had huge hands.
00:31:49,00:31:51,That's better.
00:31:51,00:31:54,You can hide the objects in your fist.
00:31:54,00:31:56,"Yeah, but you can't do it sneakily."
00:31:56,00:32:00,"Everyone's going to be like, ""What's that massive hand coming into the pick-and-mix?"""
00:32:00,00:32:03,"He's not stealing pick-and-mix, is he?"
00:32:03,00:32:06,"I think because you knock a lot of other stuff off, and they're quite fat hands,"
00:32:06,00:32:08,"I mean, they were wide hands."
00:32:08,00:32:11,"He was self-conscious enough about them that according to a friend of his,"
00:32:11,00:32:14,he used to put makeup on them to make them smaller.
00:32:14,00:32:17,What shade lines do you mean?
00:32:17,00:32:19,What are we talking about here?
00:32:19,00:32:22,"You can't make your hands look smaller with makeup, surely?"
00:32:22,00:32:25,"Well, you don't need to, so you've never had to investigate this, Andy."
00:32:25,00:32:27,Excuse me.
00:32:27,00:32:30,With that wanting to go all Donald Trump here.
00:32:30,00:32:32,There's no problem.
00:32:32,00:32:34,"I don't know how you... I haven't tried it, but apparently..."
00:32:34,00:32:36,"If anything, my hands make it look enormous, so..."
00:32:36,00:32:38,Chokes on you.
00:32:38,00:32:43,I can't see how it was hindering his stealing.
00:32:43,00:32:45,How a shade line is going to be like...
00:32:45,00:32:50,What does that guy with the minuscule fingers of a pianist think?
00:32:50,00:32:54,He didn't wear the makeup to aid his shoplifting career.
00:32:54,00:32:56,That's not what I'm claiming.
00:32:56,00:32:58,I think the wide hands wouldn't help.
00:32:58,00:33:00,"If you're trying to pick something off a shelf to put in your bag,"
00:33:00,00:33:03,"and then you knock 17 other things off with your flabby fingers,"
00:33:03,00:33:07,"wafting everywhere, then I think that's a hindrance."
00:33:07,00:33:11,"But also, his hands, they were quite mangled, weren't they, as well,"
00:33:11,00:33:13,so I think that would be one reason.
00:33:13,00:33:17,"He was a boxer as a late teenager in early 20s,"
00:33:17,00:33:20,and apparently he got really badly injured on his hands.
00:33:20,00:33:22,"According to his obituary in the Guardian,"
00:33:22,00:33:24,"he gave up boxing because his hands were quite mangled,"
00:33:24,00:33:27,"and then he became a card dealer, and he gave that up"
00:33:27,00:33:29,because his hands were on show so much.
00:33:29,00:33:32,"And he didn't want people to see his hands, he was quite embarrassed by them."
00:33:32,00:33:35,I wouldn't box someone who had hands the size of a head.
00:33:35,00:33:37,"That feels like cheating, doesn't it?"
00:33:37,00:33:40,"But if he was wearing strategic makeup on his hands,"
00:33:40,00:33:43,"to make them look tiny, you'd get in the ring."
00:33:43,00:33:48,He used to do almost like weird fight club style fighting.
00:33:48,00:33:50,But we can't talk about that coming.
00:33:50,00:33:51,"Yeah, let's move on."
00:33:51,00:33:55,"But I did read this in one place where in the apartment that he lived in,"
00:33:55,00:33:57,"people would sort of buzz in and they would come up,"
00:33:57,00:34:00,and then him and his flatmates would just beat each other up
00:34:00,00:34:03,"until one was knocked out, and then people would leave"
00:34:03,00:34:05,and then they would just still be in the flat with each other
00:34:05,00:34:07,"and go, ""Same time tomorrow, what's for dinner?"""
00:34:07,00:34:09,"You know, they were flatmates doing it."
00:34:09,00:34:10,Other people watching them box.
00:34:10,00:34:11,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:34:11,00:34:13,You came to watch a boxing match in someone's apartment.
00:34:13,00:34:15,That supposedly is a story.
00:34:15,00:34:16,I would 100% go to that.
00:34:16,00:34:17,Really?
00:34:17,00:34:19,Two of my friends said they're going to have a fight.
00:34:19,00:34:20,Yeah.
00:34:20,00:34:21,I'm not missing that.
00:34:21,00:34:26,"Having met some of your friends, I actually wouldn't go to see that."
00:34:26,00:34:28,I'm afraid.
00:34:28,00:34:32,"A couple of scratches, some hair pulled, and then a cup of tea."
00:34:32,00:34:37,"Okay, well..."
00:34:37,00:34:40,We do need to move on to our final fact.
00:34:40,00:34:41,Anything before we do?
00:34:41,00:34:43,"He opened a restaurant, didn't he?"
00:34:43,00:34:48,"So, basically, you had Dean Martin and you had Jerry Lewis, did you say?"
00:34:48,00:34:49,"Yeah, Jerry Lewis."
00:34:49,00:34:51,And they were kind of partners in crime.
00:34:51,00:34:52,They had all these films.
00:34:52,00:34:54,"Dean Martin was the crooner,"
00:34:54,00:34:57,"and Jerry Lewis would always kind of jump in and do a funny thing,"
00:34:57,00:35:00,and he'd never kind of get to the end of his songs and stuff like that.
00:35:00,00:35:03,And then Dean Martin really hated this towards the end.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"They made loads and loads of money, loads and loads of movies,"
00:35:05,00:35:08,"but he got kind of a little bit jealous, I would say."
00:35:08,00:35:09,The two of them fell out.
00:35:09,00:35:11,"Anyway, Dean Martin started a restaurant,"
00:35:11,00:35:16,"and then about maybe half a year later, Jerry Lewis started a restaurant"
00:35:16,00:35:22,just down the road and stole his head chef and brought him in as a matriot D.
00:35:22,00:35:26,"And what was brilliant about that is that Dean Martin was really, really cool."
00:35:26,00:35:28,"Like you said, he's a really cool guy."
00:35:28,00:35:33,"He had all of his rat-packed friends, came, and it was a really nice ambience."
00:35:33,00:35:36,"But Jerry Lewis, it just had a massive picture of his face,"
00:35:36,00:35:40,"and just loads of gaudy Jerry Lewis stuff everywhere,"
00:35:40,00:35:44,"and he ended up losing about $300,000."
00:35:44,00:35:48,And he only opened it because he wanted to piss off his mate.
00:35:48,00:35:49,So it was Jerry Lewis who lost the money.
00:35:49,00:35:50,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:35:50,00:35:53,"I ain't not a kick in the head, you know?"
00:35:53,00:36:01,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:36:01,00:36:03,and that is James.
00:36:03,00:36:07,"Okay, you haven't heard it yet."
00:36:07,00:36:12,"Okay, my fact this week is that caves in Tasmania include"
00:36:12,00:36:14,"Poo Shooter Cave,"
00:36:14,00:36:16,"Itchy Hole,"
00:36:16,00:36:19,"Horrible Accident Cave,"
00:36:19,00:36:22,"and Dead Horse Cave,"
00:36:22,00:36:28,"which was named because at the bottom of it, they found the remains of a cow."
00:36:28,00:36:30,I've just got that joke.
00:36:30,00:36:32,"It's not a joke, it's true."
00:36:32,00:36:33,It's what happens.
00:36:33,00:36:35,They call it Dead Horse Cave even though there was a cow.
00:36:35,00:36:36,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:36,00:36:37,It's good.
00:36:37,00:36:38,"Oh, that's comedy."
00:36:38,00:36:39,"Oh, no, it's good."
00:36:39,00:36:43,You're sort of doing the subtitles for people who don't get jokes.
00:36:43,00:36:45,"They're all for me, Anna."
00:36:45,00:36:46,They're all for me.
00:36:46,00:36:47,"A lot of questions,"
00:36:47,00:36:50,but I guess let's start with the horse cow confusion.
00:36:50,00:36:52,"Okay, yes, so they found the skeleton,"
00:36:52,00:36:55,"and at first they thought it was a horse, and it turned out to be a cow."
00:36:55,00:36:57,"Basically, what happened was earlier this month,"
00:36:57,00:36:59,"we're doing the T-Series of QI at the moment,"
00:36:59,00:37:01,"and we're looking for things beginning with T,"
00:37:01,00:37:03,"and I was looking at something called Takikardia,"
00:37:03,00:37:05,"which means like a fast heartbeat,"
00:37:05,00:37:08,"and I found a place called Takikardia Cave, which is in Tasmania,"
00:37:08,00:37:10,"and because when they first went in the people,"
00:37:10,00:37:13,"they got a real shot of a heart, almost like a heart type,"
00:37:13,00:37:15,"and they were like, ""Wow, this is amazing."""
00:37:15,00:37:18,So then I just got into a massive detour about caves in Tasmania
00:37:18,00:37:21,"and spent about a week looking at these things,"
00:37:21,00:37:23,"and I found a list of caves,"
00:37:23,00:37:27,"and this is just in the Junea Florentine area of south, southern Tasmania,"
00:37:27,00:37:30,"and it was in a caving magazine from 2006,"
00:37:30,00:37:32,"and there's a guy called Greg Middleton,"
00:37:32,00:37:35,"and he listed all of the caves where all the names came from,"
00:37:35,00:37:38,"and I love it, and I messaged him, and he got back to me,"
00:37:38,00:37:44,"and he says his database now has 6,955 Australian caves"
00:37:44,00:37:46,that he's gone and tried to find the etymologies of.
00:37:46,00:37:48,Can we read some?
00:37:48,00:37:50,"Oh, yeah, I mean, my favourite of all..."
00:37:50,00:37:53,"I'll just go straight to my favourite, which is Harry Goat Hole."
00:37:53,00:37:58,"OK, and I spoke to this guy, Greg Middleton, about this,"
00:37:58,00:38:02,"and apparently the name ""Harry Goat Hole"" comes from a job,"
00:38:02,00:38:04,"which was a ""Harry Goat""."
00:38:04,00:38:06,"So this was a human who would be this,"
00:38:06,00:38:09,and what you would do is you would walk around an area of Tasmania
00:38:09,00:38:11,"with a pair of shorts on,"
00:38:11,00:38:13,and you would walk and you would just wait
00:38:13,00:38:16,"so you felt a little bit of air going up your trousers,"
00:38:16,00:38:18,"and then when you felt that little tickle,"
00:38:18,00:38:20,"it meant there was a cave below you,"
00:38:20,00:38:22,"and that's how they used to find caves,"
00:38:22,00:38:24,"and they used to call them the ""Harry Goat"","
00:38:24,00:38:27,"and one of the ones that they found was called ""Harry Goat Hole""."
00:38:27,00:38:29,I love it. No way.
00:38:29,00:38:31,I've got a question.
00:38:31,00:38:33,"These cavers, are they the ones who are choosing the name,"
00:38:33,00:38:35,or do some of the caves already have names?
00:38:35,00:38:37,"It's usually if you've found one, you get to name it."
00:38:37,00:38:41,And it seems to be that they have a board of caving experts
00:38:41,00:38:43,"who are doing this, and they meet together,"
00:38:43,00:38:45,and so they write the sort of notes.
00:38:45,00:38:47,"So you have ones that are like called ""menage à trois"","
00:38:47,00:38:50,"and the notes will say ""cave with three tiny entrances""."
00:38:50,00:38:52,No further details.
00:38:52,00:38:54,"Or you have ""toss pot""."
00:38:54,00:38:56,The description of why it's called that says
00:38:56,00:38:58,"""I took a long time exploring,"
00:38:58,00:39:00,"and on emerging from the hole, Gavin made the remark,"
00:39:00,00:39:02,"'Gee, you took your time. What were you doing there?"
00:39:02,00:39:04,"Having a toss?'"""
00:39:04,00:39:06,That's why it's called that.
00:39:06,00:39:09,Is the cave and committee comprised entirely of 13-year-old boys?
00:39:09,00:39:11,Pretty much.
00:39:11,00:39:13,There is another theory that that comes from the...
00:39:13,00:39:15,"like they threw a lot of rocks down there,"
00:39:15,00:39:17,and they were tossing rocks down there.
00:39:17,00:39:20,There's two reasons for it in the spreadsheet.
00:39:20,00:39:23,Names in Tasmania in general are extraordinary.
00:39:23,00:39:26,"There's a British film called ""Strumpshore, Tinkleton and Giggleswick"","
00:39:26,00:39:28,and they...
00:39:28,00:39:30,They are a comedy film.
00:39:30,00:39:33,"They find interesting and amusing place names for all over the world,"
00:39:33,00:39:36,"and so they did Australia and Tasmania recently,"
00:39:36,00:39:38,and they make maps of them.
00:39:38,00:39:42,"So Tasmania has ""Thrush Forest"", ""Mossy Nipple Bend"","
00:39:42,00:39:44,"""Misery Knob"", ""Funny Knob Creek"","
00:39:44,00:39:47,"""Guy's Dirty Hole"","
00:39:47,00:39:49,"""The Butts, The Nipples"", ""Tongue's Point""."
00:39:49,00:39:52,It's got an incredible number of really...
00:39:52,00:39:54,It's weird because it's an absolutely stunning place.
00:39:54,00:39:56,Yeah.
00:39:56,00:39:58,I don't know what they're trying to do. Repel tourists?
00:39:58,00:40:00,It's very weird.
00:40:00,00:40:02,Lovely bottom plays up there.
00:40:02,00:40:04,"Thank you, but we are in the middle of a show, Dan."
00:40:04,00:40:06,I had to acknowledge it.
00:40:06,00:40:08,We were all thinking it.
00:40:08,00:40:12,"I mean, lovely bottom is one but of but a number of bottoms in Tasmania."
00:40:12,00:40:14,Lots of bottoms.
00:40:14,00:40:16,"Lovely bottom, prickly bottom, deep bottom,"
00:40:16,00:40:18,"officer's bottom, broad bottom, bottom fancy."
00:40:18,00:40:21,"Boomer's bottom, round bottom, stumpy's bottom, bottom lagoon."
00:40:21,00:40:23,Lake Fanny.
00:40:23,00:40:26,The Butts and the But of Liberty.
00:40:26,00:40:28,They're all in Tasmania.
00:40:28,00:40:30,"All named after one person, weren't they?"
00:40:30,00:40:33,"Also, they've got a place called Baghdad,"
00:40:33,00:40:35,and Baghdad and Tasmania.
00:40:35,00:40:38,"It's only got about 650 people living there,"
00:40:38,00:40:40,"but in 2003, a lot of people..."
00:40:40,00:40:42,America invaded.
00:40:42,00:40:46,"Josh W. Bush is like, ""It's around here somewhere."""
00:40:46,00:40:48,Cover all the bases.
00:40:48,00:40:50,And they still lost.
00:40:50,00:40:56,"But their website, the Tau website, got inundated with people"
00:40:56,00:40:58,"messaging them with sympathy, going,"
00:40:58,00:41:01,"""If there's anything we can do for you, we will try and help."""
00:41:01,00:41:04,"No, they did. It was reported that they had something like"
00:41:04,00:41:07,"15,000 hits in the month after the invasion of Iraq,"
00:41:07,00:41:11,where they had people mistaking them as the actual Baghdad.
00:41:11,00:41:13,"Which doesn't make sense,"
00:41:13,00:41:16,"because this is going to the website manager, Lorraine Bennett,"
00:41:16,00:41:19,"who said, ""Our number of hits doubled to 15,000."""
00:41:19,00:41:21,"Now, the town population is 650."
00:41:21,00:41:24,"I do not believe they were getting 7,500 hits before that."
00:41:24,00:41:27,I thought that as well. What an insane claim.
00:41:27,00:41:29,"What is it, Baghdad.com?"
00:41:29,00:41:31,Because they might have got people accidentally going on.
00:41:31,00:41:33,"It's Baghdad without the H in the middle, right?"
00:41:33,00:41:35,So it's spelt very slightly differently.
00:41:35,00:41:38,"You land up there, you think, ""Oh, Baghdad looks a little different"
00:41:38,00:41:42,"to how I imagined a major Middle Eastern city would look."""
00:41:42,00:41:45,"But, okay, did they take the money? They should have."
00:41:45,00:41:48,"No, no, it wasn't comic relief. It was a..."
00:41:48,00:41:50,"No, but people were writing, offering help."
00:41:50,00:41:53,"Oh, no, it was just support, like, ""Good luck."""
00:41:53,00:41:58,"And I'm skeptical again, because Lorraine Kelly said,"
00:41:58,00:42:00,"""We're getting messages from everywhere."
00:42:00,00:42:02,"We're getting messages from Yugoslavia."""
00:42:02,00:42:05,Why? Sorry. Do you say Lorraine Kelly?
00:42:05,00:42:08,Lorraine Bennett. It was Lorraine Bennett.
00:42:08,00:42:10,You can see how this kind of thing happens.
00:42:10,00:42:12,I did have to check.
00:42:12,00:42:15,Paul Lorraine Kelly is now getting messages from locals
00:42:15,00:42:18,"asking about, ""This week in Baghdad and Tasmania,"
00:42:18,00:42:21,"are we still having the market sale or..."""
00:42:21,00:42:24,Are there funny place names in Tasmania?
00:42:24,00:42:26,"If you want to really dig deep,"
00:42:26,00:42:29,"if you go to the government list of them,"
00:42:29,00:42:33,"if it's place names, or one word, placenames.tas.gov.au,"
00:42:33,00:42:37,"you can search any name of anywhere in Tasmania,"
00:42:37,00:42:40,"and you will get sort of a full list,"
00:42:40,00:42:42,"like a really proper official list of when it was discovered,"
00:42:42,00:42:44,"when it was named, who named it,"
00:42:44,00:42:46,various debates that have happened in various council meetings
00:42:46,00:42:48,over the years about whether they should change the name
00:42:48,00:42:51,from Tit Valley to Boob Valley or whatever.
00:42:51,00:42:53,And it's incredible.
00:42:53,00:42:55,They've gone into the reason for all of these names.
00:42:55,00:42:57,"So, Milkshake Hills,"
00:42:57,00:42:59,it seemed due to apparently the similarity
00:42:59,00:43:01,of the Hills to Women's Breasts.
00:43:01,00:43:03,"- Okay. - Oh, really?"
00:43:03,00:43:05,There's lots of that in the States as well.
00:43:05,00:43:07,- With Milkshake. - Yeah.
00:43:07,00:43:09,"Australian Women's Breasts produce Milkshake,"
00:43:09,00:43:12,another weird thing about Australia.
00:43:12,00:43:14,"There's Trousers Point,"
00:43:14,00:43:17,which apparently commemorates the lucky escape
00:43:17,00:43:19,"of a certain John Burgess,"
00:43:19,00:43:21,"who, without his trousers,"
00:43:21,00:43:26,escaped from the wreck nearby of the Sarah Anne Blanche in 1871.
00:43:26,00:43:28,Just so good.
00:43:28,00:43:30,Mount Miss Management.
00:43:30,00:43:32,"Bloke was naming it, left his compass behind,"
00:43:32,00:43:34,"got all the way back to base, had to go back there."
00:43:34,00:43:36,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:36,00:43:38,"I love this place in Tasmania,"
00:43:38,00:43:40,"and if we ever get back there, I want to visit."
00:43:40,00:43:42,"It's called Dewtown, D-W-O town."
00:43:42,00:43:46,"And so, this is 79 kilometres southeast of Hobart,"
00:43:46,00:43:48,"and it was established in the 1830s,"
00:43:48,00:43:50,"and it was a sort of timber station,"
00:43:50,00:43:52,which eventually has become a shack community.
00:43:52,00:43:54,"So, there's a lot of people living there."
00:43:54,00:43:56,"In 1935, an architect called Eric Round"
00:43:56,00:43:58,"put up this name plate that said,"
00:43:58,00:44:01,"""Do I 99?"""
00:44:01,00:44:03,That was just the name of his house.
00:44:03,00:44:06,"Then someone next to him saw the ""do"""
00:44:06,00:44:08,"and put ""do me"" as their sign."
00:44:08,00:44:10,They're forward.
00:44:10,00:44:12,"And then the next person put a sign saying,"
00:44:12,00:44:14,"""do us."""
00:44:14,00:44:18,"And then slowly, everyone just started renaming their places"
00:44:18,00:44:20,"as something to do with ""do."""
00:44:20,00:44:22,"So, if you go to Dewtown now, which is what it's called,"
00:44:22,00:44:24,you will find houses that are all called
00:44:24,00:44:26,"""do us, too."""
00:44:26,00:44:28,"""Didgeridoo."""
00:44:28,00:44:30,"You got ""do nothing."""
00:44:30,00:44:32,"""Dr. Doolittle."""
00:44:32,00:44:34,"""Love me, do."""
00:44:34,00:44:36,"And ""do fuck all"" is the last one I have."
00:44:36,00:44:38,"There's actually, isn't there one house"
00:44:38,00:44:40,"that hasn't abided by this,"
00:44:40,00:44:42,and is called Medhurst?
00:44:42,00:44:45,Everyone in that town must really hate them.
00:44:45,00:44:47,"It's like, come on, you've got to do it."
00:44:47,00:44:49,"Susan, are you sure you don't want to,"
00:44:49,00:44:51,because we're all doing the cool thing?
00:44:51,00:44:53,Do it.
00:44:53,00:44:57,That list of places in Tasmania
00:44:57,00:44:59,"that you were talking about, Anna,"
00:44:59,00:45:01,"I found one on there which is called ""Hard to Find Dam."""
00:45:01,00:45:03,"It does seem like it's a place according to the website,"
00:45:03,00:45:05,but there's no results on Google Maps.
00:45:05,00:45:07,Really?
00:45:07,00:45:09,There's a thing in Tasmania
00:45:09,00:45:11,"that they started doing last year,"
00:45:11,00:45:14,which is enhancing their dual naming policy.
00:45:14,00:45:17,"So, basically, Tasmanian places had settler names,"
00:45:17,00:45:19,and then started to be giving
00:45:19,00:45:21,kind of a range of Aboriginal names
00:45:21,00:45:23,"in the late 19th century,"
00:45:23,00:45:25,because Tasmania has a horrendous history
00:45:25,00:45:27,of dealing with the Aboriginal community.
00:45:27,00:45:29,There was a time in 1876
00:45:29,00:45:32,"where it was close to extinguished,"
00:45:32,00:45:34,"where everyone suddenly went,"
00:45:34,00:45:36,"""Shit, we should start calling stuff Aboriginal names."""
00:45:36,00:45:39,"So now there's a policy of renaming a lot of places,"
00:45:39,00:45:41,or giving places two names.
00:45:41,00:45:43,"One would be the Aboriginal name,"
00:45:43,00:45:45,"and one would be the settler name,"
00:45:45,00:45:47,but they were quite random and often had no relation
00:45:47,00:45:49,to the place was.
00:45:49,00:45:51,"So they named things like a Marawa,"
00:45:51,00:45:53,"which means number one, no one knows why,"
00:45:53,00:45:55,"Kamona means venom,"
00:45:55,00:45:57,"and Tanina, Tanina Bluff,"
00:45:57,00:45:59,means to fart.
00:45:59,00:46:01,No one knows why.
00:46:01,00:46:03,"They used one which was Laiawini,"
00:46:03,00:46:05,it means frigid or cold.
00:46:05,00:46:07,"They just randomly gave it that name,"
00:46:07,00:46:09,but they later found out that it is actually
00:46:09,00:46:11,"the coldest town in the whole of Tasmania,"
00:46:11,00:46:13,which is by coincidence.
00:46:13,00:46:15,"We're going to have to wrap up soon, guys."
00:46:15,00:46:17,"I'm sorry, Douglas."
00:46:17,00:46:19,"I've got some Irish cave names,"
00:46:19,00:46:21,if you want to hear them.
00:46:21,00:46:23,That is the best reaction
00:46:23,00:46:25,that has ever got anywhere in the world.
00:46:25,00:46:29,"Irish caves, here we go."
00:46:29,00:46:31,Cockpot.
00:46:31,00:46:33,Cool cave.
00:46:33,00:46:35,That sounds good. Dave's pot.
00:46:35,00:46:37,No name hole.
00:46:37,00:46:39,Rubbish cave.
00:46:39,00:46:43,And Tory Hole.
00:46:43,00:46:45,Oh.
00:46:45,00:46:47,And apparently every year at Tory Hole
00:46:47,00:46:49,there's a party.
00:46:49,00:46:51,"No, stop it."
00:46:51,00:46:53,Honestly.
00:46:53,00:46:55,"It's a work event, James."
00:46:55,00:46:57,They've been incredibly clear.
00:46:57,00:47:03,"Basically, loads of people flocked"
00:47:03,00:47:05,"to Tory Hole,"
00:47:05,00:47:07,and apparently what happened was
00:47:07,00:47:09,"many years ago there was a fiddler,"
00:47:09,00:47:11,"and the fiddler went inside Tory Hole,"
00:47:11,00:47:13,and
00:47:13,00:47:15,come on.
00:47:15,00:47:17,"Like, God, guys, it's your own time you're wasting."
00:47:17,00:47:21,"He was never seen again,"
00:47:21,00:47:23,"the fiddler,"
00:47:23,00:47:25,and now every year people go to Tory Hole
00:47:25,00:47:27,and they can hear music emanating
00:47:27,00:47:29,from Tory Hole. Wow.
00:47:29,00:47:31,I just think it sounds like Boris Johnson's
00:47:31,00:47:33,chat-up line.
00:47:33,00:47:35,"Well, fancy a fiddler in Tory Hole?"
00:47:35,00:47:37,Yeah.
00:47:37,00:47:39,Music comes out once a year.
00:47:39,00:47:41,Yeah.
00:47:41,00:47:43,"All right, look."
00:47:43,00:47:45,We need to wrap up. That is it.
00:47:45,00:47:47,That is all of our facts. Thank you so much
