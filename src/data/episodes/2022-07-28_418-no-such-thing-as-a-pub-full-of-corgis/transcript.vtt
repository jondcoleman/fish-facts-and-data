00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.760
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.520
 and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.020
 this week coming to you live from Dublin.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.020
 (audience cheering)

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.760
 My name is Dan Shriver.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.340
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.320
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.520
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.960
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.280
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.100
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.960
 My fact this week is that there is a town in Russia

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.120
 that hosts an annual festival to celebrate mosquitoes.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.000
 The main event is the most delicious competition

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.280
 in which girls compete to see how many times

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.920
 they can get bitten by a mosquito

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.620
 after standing around for 20 minutes.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.080
 (audience laughing)

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.080
 Now I should say it's not one mosquito

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.560
 that's doing the biting.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.560
 - In actual fact, sometimes it's no mosquitoes.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.320
 So in 2014, this was the second version of this festival.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.920
 They did it next to the city pond,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.980
 but it was so cold that all the mosquitoes had died.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.240
 (audience laughing)

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.000
 And so it was a no scar draw in the end.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.440
 Everyone got no bites.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.400
 - Oh, well there you go.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.240
 - Can you lure mosquitoes to you?

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.880
 - No, there are kind of strict rules about this.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.520
 So this is in Berezniki, which is in the Ural Mountains.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.720
 This is in Russia.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.840
 And you would send out these girls with their parents

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.280
 into a forest, and they would go picking berries.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.680
 - It's just sort of a Grimm's fairy tale.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.640
 (audience laughing)

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.960
 - I think, so the idea is that they just pick berries,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.160
 and it's very kind of, yes, dark, but.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.040
 - Wait, do the girls know they're in this competition?

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.040
 - Yes, they do.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.280
 - I assume they must do, yeah.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.560
 And so they spend 20 minutes or so in there,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.800
 and then they come back out,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.520
 and then they all have to stand on a stage,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.640
 and a panel of judges, including a doctor,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.720
 comes in in specs, where all the bite locations are,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.040
 and the one with the most bites wins.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.320
 And so the reason I think that this got a bit big

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.680
 was because there was a report in 2013, I believe,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.760
 it was where they announced Irina was the winner that year.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.360
 She had 43 bites.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.800
 And, you know, remember 2013 was the year of Zika?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.600
 You know, they were sort of saying,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.920
 "Oh, this is a bit bold, isn't it?"

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.440
 Having, sending a child.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.680
 But obviously they don't have Zika there, or at least.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.800
 - But well done to the person who just booed Zika.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.160
 I think we all can agree with that sentiment.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.080
 - Your liberal credentials are impeccable, yeah.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.760
 - That was actually in 2016,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.040
 the one where Irina Ilyukhina won.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.240
 - Oh, sorry, yes.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.560
 - She got 43 bites.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.320
 The next year in 2017, the winner got more than 150 bites.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.160
 - Wow.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.920
 - She was nine years old.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.440
 - What?

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.560
 Her social service has been informed about this.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.280
 - Well, according to the local newspaper in Russia,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.280
 they said that the nine-year-old winner

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.440
 did not even move her eyes,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.320
 'cause she wanted to not just have the most bites,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.640
 but also be the most patient.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.640
 - Oh, isn't that cute?

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.480
 - Are you all right?

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.680
 - No, there's no prize for that, is there?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.520
 Jesus.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.040
 And what's with the berry picking?

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.560
 It seems like it's just an excuse

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.560
 to get small children to harvest berries for free.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.720
 And then you lure them in with the temptation of getting--

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.800
 - With the promise of repeatedly being bitten.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.640
 - Exactly.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.480
 - But it's a three-day festival.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.760
 They all know why they're there.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.600
 There's lots of different things.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.720
 - What, there are more events?

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.720
 - There's more events, yeah.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.640
 You've got other events

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.720
 that include most horrible mosquito squeak contest.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.080
 I actually don't know how a mosquito squeaks,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.920
 I've just realized.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.760
 - Very, very high-pitched.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.120
 So you almost can't hear it.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.960
 You have heard it.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.800
 They go...

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.840
 - Dude, I always thought that was the wings.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.320
 That's them, them, just going...

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.560
 - Oh, that is the wings.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.160
 - Oh, it is the wings, okay.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.400
 - They squeak with their wings.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.160
 - I'm not just going around going...

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.480
 That's what I thought.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.000
 - And they have a few more things they have.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.320
 They have Mosquito Legs competition

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.640
 to see who has the legs most like a mosquito.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.600
 - Okay.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.640
 - I don't think that means having six of them.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.480
 - Spindly.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.320
 - Spindly, yeah.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.640
 It's like knobbly knees.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.360
 They have a comedy song competition

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.240
 where you have to make a comedy song about mosquitoes.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.320
 And they have a thing called Games of Winners,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.240
 which are sports competitions for children

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.040
 who've overcome serious illnesses.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.880
 - Right.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.560
 - Very serious and noble last one

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.320
 on top of two ridiculous contests.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.360
 I should have finished with the funny ones, shouldn't I?

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.400
 - Apparently Mosquito Legs is just a thing.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.480
 So they have other competitions like this around the world.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.200
 In Texas, they have a similar Mosquito Festival in Clute.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.760
 And they have a Mosquito Legs competition as well,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.360
 separate for children and adults.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.240
 And the organizers are called the SWAT team.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.680
 - Very good.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.520
 - Well, yeah.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.680
 Other weird festivals, you know.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.920
 There's a vaguely similar festival,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.880
 the Bee Wearing Festival in the Hunan Province in China.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.280
 A festival where you wear bees,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.400
 which is, I would say--

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.120
 - What do you mean by wearing bees?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.160
 - Unlike having a bee beard, we talked about that one.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.160
 - Exactly.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.080
 And you do it by hanging the queen bee

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.560
 next to your face, basically.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.640
 - Oh, that's what it is. - Another little bee cage.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.200
 Yeah, and so they have a festival

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.480
 to see who can wear the most bees.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.600
 It's pretty impressive.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.720
 And the winner was Wang Dalin of the most recent one.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.640
 He got 27 kilos of bees to sit on his body.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.000
 - What was the seven kilos of bees?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.880
 - Sorry, sorry, can I just stop you as well?

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.400
 Wang Dalink, did you say that?

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.600
 - Yeah.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.040
 - Dalink, it doesn't feel like a very--

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.880
 - Darlink.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.720
 - It's not Wang Dalink.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.640
 It's not related to the Darlink family of Peter Pan,

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.480
 I don't think.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.360
 - Darlink.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.200
 - Darlink.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.040
 - I got it, sorry. - Sorry, Darlink.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.520
 Anyway, he got 27 kilos of bees to sit on him.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.400
 - Sorry, I just love that there's people in China going,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.560
 "All right, Darlink."

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.760
 (laughing)

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.600
 - All right, Darlink, how are you doing?

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.720
 Anyway, you're only allowed to wear shorts

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.840
 and the rest of your naked, except for some goggles

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.560
 and plugs up the nose.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.760
 So that's permitted.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.520
 - So are they not worried about any of the other orifices,

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.840
 like ears, I'm thinking, like an ice?

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.120
 - I think we've mentioned before the most painful place

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.120
 to get stung is inside your nose, right?

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.800
 So maybe you're only allowed, maybe you're given one plug.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.520
 They say, you know, you put this where you choose.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.360
 - Yeah.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.200
 (laughing)

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.320
 It's a one nostril, I mean.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.400
 - One nostril, save one nostril.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.600
 - Right, wow.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.680
 What an interesting concept.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.120
 I wonder at what point when you're wearing so many bees

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.280
 that you keel over, that you're weighed down.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.040
 - 'Cause 20 kilos is pretty heavy, it's like--

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.120
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.080
 - Yeah, I guess that, I mean, they are sort of flying.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.360
 I'm not sure the extent to which they are sustaining--

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.200
 - Keep themselves up.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.200
 - Opposite question, then, at what point do you levitate

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.200
 when you have that many bees?

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.120
 - Maybe that's what they're trying to do.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.480
 - There's a festival in Portugal

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.440
 in a town called Amarante, which I really like,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.480
 and it's a romantic festival,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.280
 and it all centers around unmarried young people

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.440
 exchanging phallic cakes.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.480
 And it's a really charming thing.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.720
 The whole town gets involved.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.800
 You know, these grandmothers will be selling

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.840
 these massive Willy cakes stuffed with cream as well.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.400
 It's all really suggestive.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.040
 And they were, this festival is a very,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.920
 it's quite an old one, but it was banned

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.640
 under the days of the dictatorship in Portugal.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.280
 And the cakes were kind of driven underground.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.680
 But they were, I think they were secretly traded.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.360
 And then in 1974, they had a revolution,

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.400
 and then they were liberated from not being able to--

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.280
 - When they were driven underground,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.640
 was it like the Reformation?

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.240
 Did you have sort of priest holes,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.120
 like cake holes where you retreat in your house

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.840
 and you do a little cake sermon, do we know,

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.200
 or did it just disappear?

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.040
 - I don't know.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.400
 Maybe it hasn't been written down

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.880
 because it's two secrets still.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.560
 But they are sold year round now.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.720
 So it's kind of been untethered from their original--

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.560
 - Really?

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.160
 So in Portugal, you can get,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.240
 instead of hot cross buns, you get penises?

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.080
 No.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.920
 - Well, you can get,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.480
 as in you used to only be able to get a Willy cake

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.240
 at the right time of year, like a hot cross bun,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.000
 but now, in an arguable step forwards,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.960
 you can get a hot cross bun or a penis cake all the time.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.920
 It's good.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.040
 - I like the idea of a phallus untethered from its origin.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.000
 - I think if you--

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.960
 - If you attach enough bees to it.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.120
 - I was reading about a festival

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.880
 which happened in Mexico.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.400
 It's called San Juan de la Vega,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.000
 and it's been going for 300 years,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.200
 and this is a festival where locals will attach

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.800
 a homemade explosive to the head of their sledgehammer,

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.880
 and then they will wap it into the road

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.320
 and let it explode in front of them,

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.960
 and people watch that,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.600
 and the article I read said,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.720
 'cause there's so many people saying,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.920
 "Do you think we should stop the explosives

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.800
 "on the sledgehammer slamming to the road?

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.840
 "Bit of the festival?"

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.960
 And they say, "Absolutely not, 300 years."

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.240
 And then the same article from 2020,

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.440
 they said, "43 people were injured this year."

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.280
 - Wow.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.760
 So it's got a high every year.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.040
 - High injury rate, yeah.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.320
 - Is that in honor of something?

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.920
 Did some saint explode?

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.960
 - Yeah, it was.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.800
 No, no, it was.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.000
 There was someone who was supposedly

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.160
 the Robin Hood of this area.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.680
 In fact, the town is named after this person.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.200
 I don't think they exploded.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.120
 I should have read it, really, the article further.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.040
 - No, no, the mystery is better.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.960
 How far do you think you could throw an uncooked sausage?

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.240
 - Ah.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.280
 - Straight from the freezer, or is it?

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.320
 - No, I think it's malleable, so it's been defrosted,

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.680
 but it is wrapped in plastic, so you've got, you know.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.800
 - So is it different to a cooked sausage?

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.640
 - Yes.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.480
 - Yes, okay.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.760
 It's someone in the audience.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.240
 Someone in the audience leapt right in there.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.840
 - The voice of experience feels like

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.200
 it's speaking from the audience.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.080
 - I reckon I could throw one into the circle from here.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.400
 - All right.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.480
 - Do it, do it, do it!

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.680
 Let's all get the sausage we keep on our pockets out.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.440
 Everyone, what do you think?

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.920
 We're just carrying raw sausages around with us.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.120
 - I reckon around 40 yards.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.960
 - 40 yards.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.800
 - Do what am I--

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.440
 - 120 feet, pretty good.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.120
 - I am 20, it's 17 meters.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.040
 Sorry, I don't know why I'm giving such a thought

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.840
 through the answer.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.320
 - Yards and answering meters.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.200
 Dan, do you want to throw in furlongs, maybe?

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.040
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.680
 - Let's all make us nice and comparable.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.920
 - 20 leagues.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.120
 (laughing)

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.720
 - Well, I'll tell you, the record

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.080
 for throwing a standard raw

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.880
 at the Harwich Essex Sausage Festival

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.160
 is 171 feet, which I think is very good.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.000
 - What did I say I could do?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.720
 - You said 120 feet, not bad.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.560
 - Wow.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.880
 - That's held by a man called Todd Rothwell,

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.160
 just to give him his due.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.480
 And that was apparently thrown under perfect conditions.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.320
 There was--

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.320
 (laughing)

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.960
 - Was the wit like, wind assisted?

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.200
 - I don't know about prevailing wind,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.240
 but the previous record was about 140 feet,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.400
 and that was held for years and years,

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.640
 and then he smashed through it.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.600
 And they take it very seriously,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.720
 obviously not very seriously,

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.040
 'cause it's not a very serious thing to do,

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.240
 but it's judged by a proper cricket umpire

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.800
 to prevent any foul play.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.640
 - Okay.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.640
 - And there are sausage marshals

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.960
 who stand along, you know, sausage alley

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.320
 and observe the throws.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.720
 - Oh, okay, to look for the throw itself.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.560
 - You wouldn't, it's like,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.960
 to stop people walking up to a sausage

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.800
 and then just kicking it another few--

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.680
 - I just don't see how, if you're a cricket umpire,

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.480
 that job sort of transfers.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.960
 I don't see what's special about it,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.760
 unless there's loads of cheating Australians in this spot.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.920
 - I don't--

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.560
 - What, ow.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.280
 - If you rub some sandpaper on the skin of the sausage,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.120
 it will light.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.440
 - Nice.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.560
 Guys, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.240
 - Oh, you can get tornadoes of mosquitoes.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.080
 Do you know that?

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.120
 With millions of them.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.040
 This is in Russia as well, in Kotakka.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.640
 So you can see videos of them online.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.080
 There's millions and millions of them,

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.840
 and they're going round and round, just like a tornado.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.920
 And if you walk into them, like literally,

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.000
 you're going for a second,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.680
 and you're covered from head to toe in mosquitoes.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.120
 But you'd never get bitten.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.600
 Do you know why that is?

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.920
 - They're dead.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.400
 - Dead? How are they flying?

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.120
 - They've been picked up by a tornado.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.960
 I've got confused.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.800
 - Got it, got it.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.440
 - They're not dead, they're not dead, they're not dead.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.440
 - You're dead.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.360
 (audience laughing)

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.200
 You can get this.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.560
 I know you can get this.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.960
 - They're all what?

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.640
 - They're all males.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.280
 - They're all males.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.520
 There are a few females there,

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.320
 but these are all really, really horny males

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.200
 that are spinning around in a tornado

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.600
 to attract the female in like a mating dance.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.440
 - Wow.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.160
 - And eventually, you know, they'll have sex,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.600
 but in the meantime, if you walk in them,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.440
 they won't bite you 'cause only females bite.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.440
 - Well, that's so nice.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.840
 So not only if they come towards you,

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.680
 will they not bite you,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.040
 but it sort of means they fancy you, presumably.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.560
 - I think they'll be disappointed if...

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.080
 I mean, they might see my legs and go,

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.400
 "They're mosquito legs."

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.760
 (audience laughing)

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.880
 - I need to move us on, guys.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.160
 We need to go on to our next fact.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.800
 It is time for fact number two,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.000
 and that is Anna.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.840
 - My fact this week is that pigs used to walk to market

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.720
 wearing woolen socks.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.720
 (audience laughing)

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.920
 This is pigs when they were being walked to market.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.440
 So they would be drove, drove and driven.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.680
 You know, like cattle driving, pig driving.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.040
 It's when people would hire someone

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.160
 to take the animals from their farm

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.440
 and walk them all the way to the nearest market

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.280
 to flog them.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.800
 And it was a huge deal in Britain

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.960
 until the Industrial Revolution,

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.880
 in Ireland until the Industrial Revolution,

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.840
 in Australia and America after it.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.600
 But they had to walk huge distances

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.880
 and you had to present your pigs at the other end

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.920
 in good condition.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.520
 And so you protected their feet.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.280
 And to do that, they used to put little socks on them,

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.920
 but with leather soles.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.880
 So they'd keep them warm, protect them,

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.640
 and then they wouldn't graze their hooves on the path,

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.360
 and then they killed them and they got there.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.360
 (audience laughing)

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.920
 - And presumably they killed a sheep for their wool,

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.720
 maybe not killed, but also the cow for the leather.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.400
 - Yeah, it's three animals in one,

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.800
 you're getting for your money.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.360
 - Yeah, droving is very cool stuff.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.680
 (audience laughing)

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.520
 No, I--

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.360
 - Buckle in.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.200
 (audience laughing)

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.120
 - I didn't know about droving at all, or drovers.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.480
 And it was a career that was very well respected.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.360
 So I really like this, in Wales,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.880
 you would have lots of cattle being driven to market.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.000
 And they would often walk from Wales to London.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.680
 And there would be 12 drovers who had 300 cows

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.520
 between them, right?

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.960
 Pretty demanding stuff.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.080
 The animals which kept the cows in line were corgis.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.040
 That was the original use of the corgis, adorable.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.560
 - They must have been fucking knackered

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.240
 by this time they got to London.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.440
 - Little legs, I know, but they were low enough

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.520
 to avoid being kicked in the head by a cow.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.160
 So that was their superpower.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.280
 Okay, get this, they get to London,

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.480
 the cows are sold, whatever.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.440
 The humans, drovers, and the corgis

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.520
 would then travel back to Wales, separately.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.480
 The corgis would go a couple of days ahead

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.680
 because they just knew the way home.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.520
 - With who? - Who was droving the corgis?

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.240
 - Nobody. - The queen.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.360
 (audience laughing)

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.880
 - Genuinely, nobody, nobody was...

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.720
 - They just walked back on their own?

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.240
 - The corgis just remembered their way home and went.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.200
 - Like a homing pigeon?

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.560
 - Like a homing dog.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.120
 And they were just, like, and the drovers

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.400
 had to prepay the dog's food and accommodation

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.800
 in the pubs along the way.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.880
 - They had nowhere to stop for the night.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.760
 (audience laughing)

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.600
 - It's true.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.920
 - They don't know which pubs to stop at.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.960
 - Look, I read this, I read this.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.160
 - They walk in on two legs in a waistcoat

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.760
 and say, "Yeah, yeah, you put 200 quid behind the bar."

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.920
 Yeah, he definitely did.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.280
 - Three corgis in one waistcoat.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.640
 - Is that why there's never any humans

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.040
 in those poker paintings with all the dogs?

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.680
 (audience laughing)

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.880
 - Absolutely nonsense.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.360
 - It's true, it's true.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.040
 - Unbelievable. - You can't believe it.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.600
 - I read that when the drovers

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.080
 would come through the countryside,

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.520
 I read that the noise that they would make

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.240
 was neither shouting, nor calling,

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.400
 nor crying, nor singing, nor hallowing,

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.240
 nor anything else.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.080
 - Sorry, I just didn't say anything.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.880
 - No. (audience laughing)

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.640
 I think the idea was they would go,

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.000
 (growling)

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.680
 like that, just make a whole load of noise, right?

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.280
 And you would hear them coming from miles and miles away,

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.000
 just this holler-balloo of noise.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.320
 And what would you do if you're a local farmer?

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.640
 You would hide all of your cows

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.720
 and all of your cattle.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.720
 And the reason being that there was so many

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.720
 of these cattle coming down the road

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.640
 that if your cattle got stuck in there,

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.640
 you'd never get it out again.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.000
 And they'd end up taking it.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.320
 - And they'd just follow like a congerline kind of thing.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.160
 They would just--

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.440
 (audience laughing)

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.560
 - Yeah, like a congerline.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.400
 - Wow.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.240
 - That's very interesting.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.440
 The reason I started reading about this

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.160
 is 'cause my great-great-grandfather was a drover.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.120
 And we are all, on that side of the family,

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.440
 irritatingly loud and shrill.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.960
 - It all makes sense though, isn't it?

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.920
 - That's where it came from.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.560
 - What was that noise you made, James?

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.080
 (James grunting)

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:41.920
 - Oh yeah.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.520
 - Yes, they always had five bottles of wine

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.720
 by that point as well.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.080
 (audience laughing)

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.960
 - Some Scottish trovers, this is a cool thing.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.000
 The diet would be very limited when you're on the road.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.400
 So the diet would mostly consist of oats, whisky,

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.120
 and onions, I don't know, they're proportioned.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.080
 But like, there wasn't much variety in the diet.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.000
 But sometimes they would have a little bonus meal

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.520
 because they would drain some of a cow's blood en route

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.600
 and then mix it with oatmeal to make black pudding.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.440
 - Oh, would they?

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.480
 - But then the cow would kind of stay alive, right?

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.520
 They would just do, that's quite cool, isn't it?

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.660
 It's like, it's almost, it's not vegan, I wouldn't say.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.840
 (audience laughing)

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.680
 - But at least you're not--

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.760
 - Oh, it's, how is your restaurant going, James?

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.040
 (audience laughing)

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.680
 But at least it's sustainable.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.280
 - It's sustainable, yeah, yeah.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.440
 I still think the cow's looking at the oat supply

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.160
 dwindling, going, "Oh, fuck."

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.000
 (audience laughing)

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.160
 They also, they got quite bored, I think,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.840
 drovers on the walk.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.400
 'Cause it was very slow.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.920
 Like, pigs could only go about 10 miles a day.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.480
 And like, pigs are very unwieldy.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.320
 They were the worst.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.140
 They never stuck together.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.360
 Every time they saw mud, they rolled around in it.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.200
 - Taking the socks off, my man.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.600
 (audience laughing)

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.240
 It's pig with three fucking socks on.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.840
 Well, now we all have to go back, don't we?

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.680
 (audience laughing)

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.380
 Because Vinny's lost his sock.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.220
 (audience laughing)

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.760
 - Right, it was tedious work.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.480
 Apparently what they did was, they got into knitting,

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.840
 which had the obviously double bonus

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.920
 of being able to knit the pig's new socks.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.040
 But some of them, there's a really nice description

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.400
 of these huge drovers.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.680
 'Cause they were the toughest of the tough guys.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.280
 And they often had a bit of a criminally background.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.240
 Often were into stealing, livestock,

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.040
 sort of alongside the droving.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.160
 And like, quite intimidating guys.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.000
 And the description of these big, wild, hairy men

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.240
 is how it's described.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.240
 Definitely knitting away a little hat for their niece

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.280
 at the back of a bunch of cows.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.120
 - So cool.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:30.960
 That's really cool.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.240
 - Did you hear about the terrible knitters of Dent?

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.800
 (audience laughing)

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.280
 - It's a Yorkshire village called Dent.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.320
 And it was a place which was famed for his knitting.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.160
 People needed to supplement their income, very poor area.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.720
 And so they were called terrible

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.320
 because of how terribly fast they could do it.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.440
 You know, kind of terrifying.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.280
 - Oh, really?

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.120
 - Like awesome, that kind of thing.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.940
 - Oh, God, he made me a shit job.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.920
 - I would say that's quite bad branding.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.760
 - Yeah, it is.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.680
 - If you're selling your socks and you say,

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.840
 these are terrible socks, but by terrible,

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.600
 I mean, I do them terribly quickly.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.800
 (audience laughing)

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.880
 - But yeah, all the guys in Dent would knit.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.920
 And they had a thing called a knitting stick, right?

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.160
 Where you stick in your belt and it kind of anchors the wool.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.000
 So then you can knit with one hand as you're walking along.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.840
 Right?

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.120
 Some people would knit with one hand

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.400
 and churn butter with the other hand.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.600
 - What?

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.440
 How cool is that?

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.880
 - Who's holding the butterpale?

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.680
 You're balancing that on your toes?

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.740
 - I don't know.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.580
 - Wow.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.420
 - That's amazing.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.920
 And they're socks that these guys had.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.600
 The other famous thing is that they used to put tar

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.240
 on the feet of geese, didn't they?

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.080
 - Yes.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:28.920
 - That's quite a famous one.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.040
 So they would take the geese to London

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.320
 from possibly from Norfolk, somewhere like that,

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.480
 and they would put tar and sand on the feet of the geese.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.120
 And then when they would walk all the way,

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.120
 it wouldn't hurt their feet

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.360
 and they would be much better to sell.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.240
 On specialist aggregates.com,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.800
 which I'm not sure whether they're exactly right,

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.600
 but according to them, the current surfaces on roads,

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.120
 which is bitumen and like some little bits of aggregate

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.360
 as well, that directly comes from this,

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.240
 putting the tar on the feet of geese.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.040
 That was invented, then this was invented,

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.720
 and then the road was invented.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.520
 So without the geese having tar boots,

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.040
 we wouldn't have roads today.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:07.960
 - Wow.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.800
 - No way.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.640
 - Apparently.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.480
 - Oh my.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.080
 - According to specialist aggregates.com.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.160
 (laughing)

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:18.160
 - A website, I don't even understand the name of.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.280
 - Hang on a minute.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.120
 - But I love it.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.480
 - But it's got the word specialist in it.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.760
 - Yeah, it sounds like they know what they're talking about.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.960
 They're specialists and they do aggregates.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.360
 That's like, that's big stuff.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.440
 - Dot com as well.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.280
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.840
 - It's not dotco.uk or something.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.680
 - Oh well, yeah.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.520
 - It's a big dog.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.160
 - It's a big dog of the domains.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.000
 - Yeah.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.800
 - So Tom, these specialist aggregates are saying,

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.480
 it was only when we saw tar on the feet of geese

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.640
 (laughing)

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.320
 and realised it wasn't urgent that we thought,

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.240
 let's cover everyone's feet in that way.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.400
 That's unsustainable.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.680
 We'll have to peel the tar off every day.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.520
 Let's just cover the roads in that.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.280
 - That would have been a way more sustainable way

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.280
 for us all to do it.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.440
 - No, 'cause you don't want tar on your feet

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.280
 the whole time.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.120
 - No, no, no, no.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:52.960
 You're going out in the morning,

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.320
 you just dip in the tar bath.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.440
 Like you just trend through that.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.840
 Like at the entrance of a swimming pool,

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.120
 we have that little bit to walk through to clean your feet.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.640
 Everyone just walks through that on the way.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.080
 We never bothered inventing the road

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.640
 'cause everyone's wearing their own road on their feet.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.000
 - You'd have to cover all your car in tar, wouldn't you?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.720
 - Yeah, I'm not sure how the wheels actually work.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.920
 (laughing)

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.640
 - It was tar spray and chip,

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.680
 which is a process that they used on the feet of the geese.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.360
 And that is exactly the same process as we used to make.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.960
 - I'm gonna go out on a limb and say,

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.000
 we would have managed the whole tarring roads thing

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.360
 without even the geese.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.160
 So I'm gonna keep eating one at Christmas.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.360
 - Look, I would criticize that, but to be honest,

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.920
 I'm looking for a bit of support for my corgis thing.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.840
 And I'm willing to say I buy it.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.680
 - Have you guys heard,

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.880
 it's quite a famous pub in Scotland called The Drowers Inn.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.720
 - Yeah, I've stayed in that.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.960
 - You've stayed in the Drowers Inn?

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.120
 - On my honeymoon, I did.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.080
 - You're kidding.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:43.920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.880
 Just, I spent the whole time telling my wife

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.280
 about the history of droving.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.760
 In between fending off corgis from the door.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.960
 (laughing)

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.080
 This is in Loch Loughman in Scotland, right?

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.120
 It's near Loch Loughman, yeah.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.680
 - Yeah, so tell me if you experience this.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.520
 - It is a ghost.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.720
 - It's one of the most haunted places in-

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.760
 - That's why we stayed there.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.600
 - What?

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.960
 - Ow, it's haunted by a ghost drover called Angus.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.000
 And Angus, so he was killed as part of his droving.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.440
 His droving group of animals were stolen

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.080
 and they supposedly killed him.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.680
 But there's all these reports from the inn where they say,

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.600
 like someone said that they fell asleep one night

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.800
 and when they woke up in the morning,

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.920
 their camera was sitting in a different spot.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.560
 And then when they looked in the camera,

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.320
 there was all these photos of them sleeping in the bed.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.160
 - That was not proof.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.320
 - That was when I was there.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.520
 (laughing)

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.400
 - That's just proof of a pervert.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.280
 It's not a ghost.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.360
 - What pervert goes in, doesn't bring a camera,

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.160
 hoping that someone else has left the camera,

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.480
 takes the photos and then leaves them.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.160
 (laughing)

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.800
 - A very specialist one.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.720
 (laughing)

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.760
 - That's amazing.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.800
 Yeah, I saw it.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.640
 What was he called?

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.960
 Angus. - Angus.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.440
 - Yeah, I saw him and he said,

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.240
 that thing about geese is definitely true.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.500
 (laughing)

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.120
 - Any word on the corgis?

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.240
 - We've got to move on very soon.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.080
 I've got to think about transporting animals

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.240
 from one place to the other.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.640
 And I know the four of us know this,

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.040
 but I do love how they often have to transport rhinos

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.720
 in Africa to different places.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.880
 And the way, the best way that they've worked out to do it

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.880
 is to sedate the rhinos.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.560
 And then, carry them, tie up their legs

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.640
 and carry them upside down by helicopter

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.600
 and fly them to the destination they go to.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.960
 So it could be the case that if you're in certain parts

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.560
 of Africa, if you look to the sky,

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.480
 there will be an upside down rhino flying past you.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.040
 And the article I was reading,

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.480
 they were transporting 10 rhinos.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.360
 So 10 rhinos were going past in the sky.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.360
 I'm not sure at the same time,

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.440
 but you would have seen 10 rhinos during the day.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.320
 And one quite nice thing that they do

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.520
 as part of the process is, so the rhino is sedated,

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.280
 but they blindfold the rhino

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.760
 because just in case it wakes up mid-trip,

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.280
 they go, "What?!"

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.400
 (LAUGHTER)

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.400
 It's just a little sweet touch to make sure,

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.160
 at least it's like, "Ah, OK, some sort of prank is going on."

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.000
 It is amazing.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.120
 It's not that common.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.600
 If you do take a safari just to see that,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.760
 it's not guaranteed.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.640
 But they tried it with bees first, didn't they?

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.720
 But you need too many to lift them up.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.040
 That's the thing.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.120
 We need to move on to our next fact, guys.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.840
 It is time for fact number three,

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.720
 and that is Andy.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.080
 My fact is that when hosting parties,

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.720
 singer Dean Martin would sometimes ring the police

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.440
 pretending to be an angry neighbour

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.880
 so that they would ask his guests to go home instead of him.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.920
 (LAUGHTER)

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.840
 So good.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.720
 What a genius.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.320
 You know what? When you sent this...

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.520
 (CHEERING)

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.000
 When you sent this back round,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.800
 the first thing I thought is, "I bet Andy's going to do this."

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.800
 100%. I don't have guests.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.920
 But... (LAUGHTER)

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.200
 This was... It's been documented in a few places,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.680
 so it was in a documentary about him,

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.440
 and his son wrote a book about growing up being Dean Martin's son.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.360
 Dean Martin, an incredibly famous mid-20th-century singer,

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.120
 member of the Rat Pack, and he was very reserved.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.280
 Actually, he had this...

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.440
 He gave the impression of being a very sociable,

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.320
 heavy drinker, great party guy.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.400
 He really wasn't. His wife was very sociable,

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.800
 and they would have a lot of parties.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.120
 And Dean Martin wanted to be up in bed, basically.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.400
 Yeah, apparently, I read that he often wanted to play golf in the morning

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.560
 and so would get an early night, which really endeared me to him.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.280
 Yeah. This is the kind of guy we like. Yeah.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.480
 Well, I think he was... We say that he didn't drink that much,

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.480
 and that was the impression.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.520
 We've mentioned on the show before,

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.320
 Dean Martin used to have his own TV show,

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.520
 and he would constantly have a drink in his hand,

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.880
 like a whiskey or something.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.240
 And actually, it was apple juice,

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.040
 because it was part of his stick that he would be drunk on stage.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.400
 But he was someone who did drink a lot.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.880
 Like, his license plate to one of his cars was drunky,

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.280
 so it had a Y at the end of it.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.120
 That's just asking for trouble from the police.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.840
 Yeah. Well, it definitely did,

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.600
 when he had to change it to another car,

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.840
 because he crashed that car when he was drink-driving and was arrested.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.120
 OK, I'm not saying he never had a drink. It's true.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.560
 But he did. You know, he was a lot more reserved than the impression he gave.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.280
 And basically, the story is, one night,

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.120
 that his wife was having yet another party.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.720
 He was upstairs in his pyjamas, just wanting the noise to stop.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.560
 And so he phoned the police and complained,

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.280
 and the police turned up at the door, and they said,

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.280
 "Look, we're sorry we've had a complaint from the neighbours."

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.160
 It happened again a few weeks later.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.440
 He phoned the police and put on a voice, said, "I'm a neighbour."

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.000
 His wife started getting suspicious,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.280
 because the neighbours lived about two miles away.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.280
 They had a big home and a big property, and, like,

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.600
 were you hearing that much noise?

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.200
 Anyway, it happened again a few weeks after this.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.640
 And he phoned up and said,

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.360
 "Oh, I'm a neighbour of Dean Martins, and he's having a party."

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.320
 And the police just said,

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.400
 "OK, Mr. Martins, we'll be right over."

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.480
 He was really reserved to Jean Martin, who was his first wife.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.800
 She said that when she first met him, it was love at first sight.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.400
 They got married really quickly,

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.200
 and she said that she'd married him, knowing nothing about him.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.240
 And when they divorced 23 years later,

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.000
 she still knew nothing about him.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.680
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.200
 - Except that he hated parties. - Yeah.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.600
 I'd say, on a personal level, as a kid,

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.880
 I grew up on Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis movies.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.880
 And he was so cool.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.400
 Like, he was part of the Ramp Act,

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.400
 which was Frank Sinatra, was Sammy Davis Jr.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.000
 They were this group of crooning singers who also acted

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.800
 and had these mafia ties, and they used to do Las Vegas.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.040
 - Cool. - Yeah.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.880
 But they were seeing that at the time,

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.600
 and Dean was seen as the coolest person within that.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.000
 And part of his cool was that he was just an incredibly lazy guy.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.800
 So he never used to do rehearsals for the show that he did,

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.200
 which was a weekly show.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.120
 He would have a stand-in do every rehearsal.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.400
 This was part of his contract,

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.400
 for which he was paid tens of millions,

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.400
 and he would just rock up and just do the lines on the night

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.400
 and then leave before the show was even done

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.400
 to get home to be boring as fuck, as you pointed out.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.400
 His producer said, "When Dean walks through the studio floor

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.400
 "on the morning of the show, he doesn't know what he's going to sing,

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.400
 "what he's going to say, who the guest stars are going to be.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.400
 "And it reminded me of working with you, Dan."

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.400
 - Cool guy. - Yeah, cool.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.400
 Heavy mafia ties is what I'm trying to imply.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.400
 There's an Italian word for this called a menefligismo,

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.400
 which I have probably mispronounced,

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.400
 which basically means I don't give a damn.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.400
 I don't give a damnism, which is what he did, which sounded a bit cocky.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.400
 But he admitted it himself.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.400
 He said, "I can just about carry a tune, but I'm not really a good singer."

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.400
 We crew members just get by on being lazy and painless to listen to.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.400
 This is how lazy he was. He did a movie called The Caddy,

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.400
 and in The Caddy he sang a song that Capitol Records said,

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.400
 "We want to re-record this because we want to release it.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.400
 "We think it's a hit."

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.400
 And he just went, "I don't want to do that."

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.400
 And they were like, "Please, we think it's a hit."

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.400
 He said, "I don't want to do that."

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:43.400
 So Capitol Records just had to go into the movies recording that he did,

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.400
 take that and release it,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.400
 and that song was That's Amore,

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.400
 which went on to be his biggest hit and sold millions of copies.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.400
 He wasn't interested.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.400
 When you don't give a shit about your biggest hit, That's Amore.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.400
 I think we're a bit harsh about him being so reserved and antisocial and stuff,

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.400
 because I think the reason is, or one of the main reasons,

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.400
 is that he didn't speak any English until he was about five or six years old.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.400
 He was brought up in an Italian family,

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.400
 and so he was never really confident in his English,

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.400
 and when he would have conversations with people

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.400
 who would often feel like he didn't really know what to say and stuff like that.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.400
 Yeah, that's true.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:28.400
 There's another nice thing about him, which is, again, a mark of him being reserved,

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.400
 which is he and Frank Sinatra were in Las Vegas,

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.400
 and they were having a great time.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.400
 Frank Sinatra was surrounded by foxy ladies at the blackjack table, whatever.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:41.400
 The rest of them were corgis that were stopping along the way.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.400
 A load of corgis around, and Dean Martin went to bed because,

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.400
 as James pointed out, he was playing golf the next morning,

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.400
 wanted to get a good night's sleep.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.400
 The story is that Sinatra gave a call girl a thousand dollars to go upstairs

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.400
 to give Dean a good time,

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.400
 and Dean then gave the call girl two thousand dollars to just go downstairs

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.400
 and say he had been amazing.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.400
 Was that in the, could have been in the Sands Hotel,

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.400
 which they were particularly famous for staying here.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:11.400
 There's just the Rat Pack Hotel that Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin,

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.400
 the rest of the Rat Pack stayed in,

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.400
 and they caused various scandals there,

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.400
 mostly Frank Sinatra behaving badly, I think.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.400
 One night he was served mushrooms in his meal,

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.400
 and he didn't want mushrooms in his meal,

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.400
 so he tipped the entire meal over his own head, which I quite like.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.400
 And then he started, he chased the waiter into the kitchen shouting,

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.400
 "I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover!"

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.400
 Terrifying.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.400
 I don't know, he obviously doesn't hate mushrooms as much as me,

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.400
 because I can imagine chasing the waiter and stuff,

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.400
 but pouring it over your own head, that would be awful.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.400
 Yeah, well maybe you'd go one step further.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.400
 You might have done actually what he did, which is eventually get kicked out,

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.400
 because he had accrued so many gambling debts that he had to leave.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.400
 So he climbed onto one of the tables, started screaming abuse at everyone,

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.400
 threw a chair at the casino boss, who then punched him in the face,

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:02.400
 and then apparently he exited the hotel by driving a golf cart through the window.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.400
 Wow.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.400
 Sounds like me.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.400
 So he was a shoplifter as well, wasn't he?

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.400
 And apparently what he would do is he would go to a clothes shop,

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.400
 and he would buy loads and loads and loads of stuff,

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.400
 but then he would steal a couple of things,

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.400
 and he would be like, "Well, they don't mind, because I'm spending so much money,

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.400
 but he just wanted the thrill of stealing some stuff."

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.400
 When you walk from the till for a bit of a thrill, that's a moray.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:32.400
 It was less applause that time.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.400
 Yeah, I think everyone saw me...

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.400
 Have you ever heard the phrase "diminishing returns"?

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.400
 Everyone saw me slowly approaching the goal line on that one from a distance.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.400
 Is he going to get there?

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.400
 Shoplifting would have been a particular challenge for him,

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.400
 because he had huge hands.

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.400
 That's better.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.400
 You can hide the objects in your fist.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.400
 Yeah, but you can't do it sneakily.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.400
 Everyone's going to be like, "What's that massive hand coming into the pick-and-mix?"

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.400
 He's not stealing pick-and-mix, is he?

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.400
 I think because you knock a lot of other stuff off, and they're quite fat hands,

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.400
 I mean, they were wide hands.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.400
 He was self-conscious enough about them that according to a friend of his,

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.400
 he used to put makeup on them to make them smaller.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.400
 What shade lines do you mean?

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.400
 What are we talking about here?

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.400
 You can't make your hands look smaller with makeup, surely?

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.400
 Well, you don't need to, so you've never had to investigate this, Andy.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.400
 Excuse me.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.400
 With that wanting to go all Donald Trump here.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.400
 There's no problem.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.400
 I don't know how you... I haven't tried it, but apparently...

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.400
 If anything, my hands make it look enormous, so...

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.400
 Chokes on you.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.400
 I can't see how it was hindering his stealing.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.400
 How a shade line is going to be like...

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:50.400
 What does that guy with the minuscule fingers of a pianist think?

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:54.400
 He didn't wear the makeup to aid his shoplifting career.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.400
 That's not what I'm claiming.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.400
 I think the wide hands wouldn't help.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.400
 If you're trying to pick something off a shelf to put in your bag,

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.400
 and then you knock 17 other things off with your flabby fingers,

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.400
 wafting everywhere, then I think that's a hindrance.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.400
 But also, his hands, they were quite mangled, weren't they, as well,

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.400
 so I think that would be one reason.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.400
 He was a boxer as a late teenager in early 20s,

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.400
 and apparently he got really badly injured on his hands.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.400
 According to his obituary in the Guardian,

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.400
 he gave up boxing because his hands were quite mangled,

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.400
 and then he became a card dealer, and he gave that up

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.400
 because his hands were on show so much.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.400
 And he didn't want people to see his hands, he was quite embarrassed by them.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.400
 I wouldn't box someone who had hands the size of a head.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.400
 That feels like cheating, doesn't it?

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.400
 But if he was wearing strategic makeup on his hands,

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.400
 to make them look tiny, you'd get in the ring.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:48.400
 He used to do almost like weird fight club style fighting.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.400
 But we can't talk about that coming.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.400
 Yeah, let's move on.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.400
 But I did read this in one place where in the apartment that he lived in,

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.400
 people would sort of buzz in and they would come up,

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.400
 and then him and his flatmates would just beat each other up

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.400
 until one was knocked out, and then people would leave

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.400
 and then they would just still be in the flat with each other

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.400
 and go, "Same time tomorrow, what's for dinner?"

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.400
 You know, they were flatmates doing it.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.400
 Other people watching them box.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.400
 You came to watch a boxing match in someone's apartment.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.400
 That supposedly is a story.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.400
 I would 100% go to that.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.400
 Really?

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.400
 Two of my friends said they're going to have a fight.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.400
 Yeah.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.400
 I'm not missing that.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:26.400
 Having met some of your friends, I actually wouldn't go to see that.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.400
 I'm afraid.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.400
 A couple of scratches, some hair pulled, and then a cup of tea.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:37.400
 Okay, well...

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.400
 We do need to move on to our final fact.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.400
 Anything before we do?

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.400
 He opened a restaurant, didn't he?

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:48.400
 So, basically, you had Dean Martin and you had Jerry Lewis, did you say?

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.400
 Yeah, Jerry Lewis.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.400
 And they were kind of partners in crime.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.400
 They had all these films.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.400
 Dean Martin was the crooner,

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.400
 and Jerry Lewis would always kind of jump in and do a funny thing,

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.400
 and he'd never kind of get to the end of his songs and stuff like that.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.400
 And then Dean Martin really hated this towards the end.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.400
 They made loads and loads of money, loads and loads of movies,

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.400
 but he got kind of a little bit jealous, I would say.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.400
 The two of them fell out.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.400
 Anyway, Dean Martin started a restaurant,

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:16.400
 and then about maybe half a year later, Jerry Lewis started a restaurant

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:22.400
 just down the road and stole his head chef and brought him in as a matriot D.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.400
 And what was brilliant about that is that Dean Martin was really, really cool.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.400
 Like you said, he's a really cool guy.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:33.400
 He had all of his rat-packed friends, came, and it was a really nice ambience.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.400
 But Jerry Lewis, it just had a massive picture of his face,

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.400
 and just loads of gaudy Jerry Lewis stuff everywhere,

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.400
 and he ended up losing about $300,000.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.400
 And he only opened it because he wanted to piss off his mate.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.400
 So it was Jerry Lewis who lost the money.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.400
 I ain't not a kick in the head, you know?

00:35:53.400 --> 00:36:01.400
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.400
 and that is James.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.400
 Okay, you haven't heard it yet.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:12.400
 Okay, my fact this week is that caves in Tasmania include

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.400
 Poo Shooter Cave,

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.400
 Itchy Hole,

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.400
 Horrible Accident Cave,

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.400
 and Dead Horse Cave,

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:28.400
 which was named because at the bottom of it, they found the remains of a cow.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.400
 I've just got that joke.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.400
 It's not a joke, it's true.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.400
 It's what happens.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.400
 They call it Dead Horse Cave even though there was a cow.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.400
 It's good.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.400
 Oh, that's comedy.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.400
 Oh, no, it's good.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:43.400
 You're sort of doing the subtitles for people who don't get jokes.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.400
 They're all for me, Anna.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.400
 They're all for me.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.400
 A lot of questions,

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.400
 but I guess let's start with the horse cow confusion.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.400
 Okay, yes, so they found the skeleton,

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.400
 and at first they thought it was a horse, and it turned out to be a cow.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.400
 Basically, what happened was earlier this month,

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.400
 we're doing the T-Series of QI at the moment,

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.400
 and we're looking for things beginning with T,

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.400
 and I was looking at something called Takikardia,

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.400
 which means like a fast heartbeat,

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.400
 and I found a place called Takikardia Cave, which is in Tasmania,

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.400
 and because when they first went in the people,

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.400
 they got a real shot of a heart, almost like a heart type,

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.400
 and they were like, "Wow, this is amazing."

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.400
 So then I just got into a massive detour about caves in Tasmania

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.400
 and spent about a week looking at these things,

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.400
 and I found a list of caves,

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.400
 and this is just in the Junea Florentine area of south, southern Tasmania,

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.400
 and it was in a caving magazine from 2006,

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.400
 and there's a guy called Greg Middleton,

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.400
 and he listed all of the caves where all the names came from,

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:38.400
 and I love it, and I messaged him, and he got back to me,

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:44.400
 and he says his database now has 6,955 Australian caves

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.400
 that he's gone and tried to find the etymologies of.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.400
 Can we read some?

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.400
 Oh, yeah, I mean, my favourite of all...

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.400
 I'll just go straight to my favourite, which is Harry Goat Hole.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:58.400
 OK, and I spoke to this guy, Greg Middleton, about this,

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:02.400
 and apparently the name "Harry Goat Hole" comes from a job,

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.400
 which was a "Harry Goat".

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.400
 So this was a human who would be this,

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.400
 and what you would do is you would walk around an area of Tasmania

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.400
 with a pair of shorts on,

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.400
 and you would walk and you would just wait

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.400
 so you felt a little bit of air going up your trousers,

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.400
 and then when you felt that little tickle,

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.400
 it meant there was a cave below you,

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.400
 and that's how they used to find caves,

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.400
 and they used to call them the "Harry Goat",

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.400
 and one of the ones that they found was called "Harry Goat Hole".

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.400
 I love it. No way.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.400
 I've got a question.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.400
 These cavers, are they the ones who are choosing the name,

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.400
 or do some of the caves already have names?

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.400
 It's usually if you've found one, you get to name it.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.400
 And it seems to be that they have a board of caving experts

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.400
 who are doing this, and they meet together,

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.400
 and so they write the sort of notes.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.400
 So you have ones that are like called "menage à trois",

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.400
 and the notes will say "cave with three tiny entrances".

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.400
 No further details.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.400
 Or you have "toss pot".

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.400
 The description of why it's called that says

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.400
 "I took a long time exploring,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.400
 and on emerging from the hole, Gavin made the remark,

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.400
 'Gee, you took your time. What were you doing there?

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.400
 Having a toss?'"

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.400
 That's why it's called that.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.400
 Is the cave and committee comprised entirely of 13-year-old boys?

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.400
 Pretty much.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.400
 There is another theory that that comes from the...

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.400
 like they threw a lot of rocks down there,

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.400
 and they were tossing rocks down there.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.400
 There's two reasons for it in the spreadsheet.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.400
 Names in Tasmania in general are extraordinary.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.400
 There's a British film called "Strumpshore, Tinkleton and Giggleswick",

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.400
 and they...

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.400
 They are a comedy film.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.400
 They find interesting and amusing place names for all over the world,

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.400
 and so they did Australia and Tasmania recently,

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.400
 and they make maps of them.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.400
 So Tasmania has "Thrush Forest", "Mossy Nipple Bend",

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.400
 "Misery Knob", "Funny Knob Creek",

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.400
 "Guy's Dirty Hole",

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.400
 "The Butts, The Nipples", "Tongue's Point".

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.400
 It's got an incredible number of really...

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.400
 It's weird because it's an absolutely stunning place.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.400
 Yeah.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.400
 I don't know what they're trying to do. Repel tourists?

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.400
 It's very weird.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.400
 Lovely bottom plays up there.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.400
 Thank you, but we are in the middle of a show, Dan.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.400
 I had to acknowledge it.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.400
 We were all thinking it.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.400
 I mean, lovely bottom is one but of but a number of bottoms in Tasmania.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.400
 Lots of bottoms.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.400
 Lovely bottom, prickly bottom, deep bottom,

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.400
 officer's bottom, broad bottom, bottom fancy.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.400
 Boomer's bottom, round bottom, stumpy's bottom, bottom lagoon.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.400
 Lake Fanny.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.400
 The Butts and the But of Liberty.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.400
 They're all in Tasmania.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.400
 All named after one person, weren't they?

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.400
 Also, they've got a place called Baghdad,

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.400
 and Baghdad and Tasmania.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.400
 It's only got about 650 people living there,

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.400
 but in 2003, a lot of people...

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.400
 America invaded.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.400
 Josh W. Bush is like, "It's around here somewhere."

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.400
 Cover all the bases.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.400
 And they still lost.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:56.400
 But their website, the Tau website, got inundated with people

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.400
 messaging them with sympathy, going,

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.400
 "If there's anything we can do for you, we will try and help."

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.400
 No, they did. It was reported that they had something like

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.400
 15,000 hits in the month after the invasion of Iraq,

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:11.400
 where they had people mistaking them as the actual Baghdad.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.400
 Which doesn't make sense,

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.400
 because this is going to the website manager, Lorraine Bennett,

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.400
 who said, "Our number of hits doubled to 15,000."

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.400
 Now, the town population is 650.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.400
 I do not believe they were getting 7,500 hits before that.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.400
 I thought that as well. What an insane claim.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.400
 What is it, Baghdad.com?

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.400
 Because they might have got people accidentally going on.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.400
 It's Baghdad without the H in the middle, right?

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.400
 So it's spelt very slightly differently.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.400
 You land up there, you think, "Oh, Baghdad looks a little different

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.400
 to how I imagined a major Middle Eastern city would look."

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.400
 But, okay, did they take the money? They should have.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.400
 No, no, it wasn't comic relief. It was a...

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.400
 No, but people were writing, offering help.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.400
 Oh, no, it was just support, like, "Good luck."

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:58.400
 And I'm skeptical again, because Lorraine Kelly said,

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.400
 "We're getting messages from everywhere.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.400
 We're getting messages from Yugoslavia."

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.400
 Why? Sorry. Do you say Lorraine Kelly?

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.400
 Lorraine Bennett. It was Lorraine Bennett.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.400
 You can see how this kind of thing happens.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.400
 I did have to check.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.400
 Paul Lorraine Kelly is now getting messages from locals

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.400
 asking about, "This week in Baghdad and Tasmania,

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.400
 are we still having the market sale or..."

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.400
 Are there funny place names in Tasmania?

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.400
 If you want to really dig deep,

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.400
 if you go to the government list of them,

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:33.400
 if it's place names, or one word, placenames.tas.gov.au,

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.400
 you can search any name of anywhere in Tasmania,

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.400
 and you will get sort of a full list,

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.400
 like a really proper official list of when it was discovered,

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.400
 when it was named, who named it,

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.400
 various debates that have happened in various council meetings

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.400
 over the years about whether they should change the name

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.400
 from Tit Valley to Boob Valley or whatever.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.400
 And it's incredible.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.400
 They've gone into the reason for all of these names.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.400
 So, Milkshake Hills,

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.400
 it seemed due to apparently the similarity

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.400
 of the Hills to Women's Breasts.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.400
 - Okay. - Oh, really?

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.400
 There's lots of that in the States as well.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.400
 - With Milkshake. - Yeah.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.400
 Australian Women's Breasts produce Milkshake,

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.400
 another weird thing about Australia.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.400
 There's Trousers Point,

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.400
 which apparently commemorates the lucky escape

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.400
 of a certain John Burgess,

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.400
 who, without his trousers,

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:26.400
 escaped from the wreck nearby of the Sarah Anne Blanche in 1871.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.400
 Just so good.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.400
 Mount Miss Management.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.400
 Bloke was naming it, left his compass behind,

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.400
 got all the way back to base, had to go back there.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.400
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.400
 I love this place in Tasmania,

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.400
 and if we ever get back there, I want to visit.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.400
 It's called Dewtown, D-W-O town.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:46.400
 And so, this is 79 kilometres southeast of Hobart,

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.400
 and it was established in the 1830s,

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.400
 and it was a sort of timber station,

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.400
 which eventually has become a shack community.

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.400
 So, there's a lot of people living there.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.400
 In 1935, an architect called Eric Round

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.400
 put up this name plate that said,

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.400
 "Do I 99?"

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.400
 That was just the name of his house.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.400
 Then someone next to him saw the "do"

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.400
 and put "do me" as their sign.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.400
 They're forward.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.400
 And then the next person put a sign saying,

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.400
 "do us."

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.400
 And then slowly, everyone just started renaming their places

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.400
 as something to do with "do."

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.400
 So, if you go to Dewtown now, which is what it's called,

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.400
 you will find houses that are all called

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.400
 "do us, too."

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.400
 "Didgeridoo."

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.400
 You got "do nothing."

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.400
 "Dr. Doolittle."

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.400
 "Love me, do."

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.400
 And "do fuck all" is the last one I have.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.400
 There's actually, isn't there one house

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.400
 that hasn't abided by this,

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.400
 and is called Medhurst?

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.400
 Everyone in that town must really hate them.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.400
 It's like, come on, you've got to do it.

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.400
 Susan, are you sure you don't want to,

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.400
 because we're all doing the cool thing?

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.400
 Do it.

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.400
 That list of places in Tasmania

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.400
 that you were talking about, Anna,

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.400
 I found one on there which is called "Hard to Find Dam."

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.400
 It does seem like it's a place according to the website,

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.400
 but there's no results on Google Maps.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.400
 Really?

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.400
 There's a thing in Tasmania

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.400
 that they started doing last year,

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.400
 which is enhancing their dual naming policy.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.400
 So, basically, Tasmanian places had settler names,

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.400
 and then started to be giving

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.400
 kind of a range of Aboriginal names

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.400
 in the late 19th century,

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.400
 because Tasmania has a horrendous history

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.400
 of dealing with the Aboriginal community.

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.400
 There was a time in 1876

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.400
 where it was close to extinguished,

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.400
 where everyone suddenly went,

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.400
 "Shit, we should start calling stuff Aboriginal names."

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.400
 So now there's a policy of renaming a lot of places,

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.400
 or giving places two names.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.400
 One would be the Aboriginal name,

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.400
 and one would be the settler name,

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.400
 but they were quite random and often had no relation

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.400
 to the place was.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.400
 So they named things like a Marawa,

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.400
 which means number one, no one knows why,

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.400
 Kamona means venom,

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.400
 and Tanina, Tanina Bluff,

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.400
 means to fart.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.400
 No one knows why.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.400
 They used one which was Laiawini,

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.400
 it means frigid or cold.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.400
 They just randomly gave it that name,

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.400
 but they later found out that it is actually

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.400
 the coldest town in the whole of Tasmania,

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.400
 which is by coincidence.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.400
 We're going to have to wrap up soon, guys.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.400
 I'm sorry, Douglas.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.400
 I've got some Irish cave names,

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.400
 if you want to hear them.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.400
 That is the best reaction

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.400
 that has ever got anywhere in the world.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.400
 Irish caves, here we go.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.400
 Cockpot.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.400
 Cool cave.

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.400
 That sounds good. Dave's pot.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.400
 No name hole.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.400
 Rubbish cave.

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:43.400
 And Tory Hole.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.400
 Oh.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.400
 And apparently every year at Tory Hole

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.400
 there's a party.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.400
 No, stop it.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.400
 Honestly.

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.400
 It's a work event, James.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.400
 They've been incredibly clear.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:03.400
 Basically, loads of people flocked

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.400
 to Tory Hole,

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.400
 and apparently what happened was

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.400
 many years ago there was a fiddler,

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.400
 and the fiddler went inside Tory Hole,

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.400
 and

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.400
 come on.

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.400
 Like, God, guys, it's your own time you're wasting.

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:21.400
 He was never seen again,

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.400
 the fiddler,

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.400
 and now every year people go to Tory Hole

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.400
 and they can hear music emanating

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.400
 from Tory Hole. Wow.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.400
 I just think it sounds like Boris Johnson's

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.400
 chat-up line.

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.400
 Well, fancy a fiddler in Tory Hole?

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.400
 Yeah.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.400
 Music comes out once a year.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.400
 Yeah.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.400
 All right, look.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.400
 We need to wrap up. That is it.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.400
