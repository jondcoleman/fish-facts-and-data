00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
 (electronic music)

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,040
 (electronic music)

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,940
 (electronic music)

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,280
 (audience cheering)

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,380
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,180
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,160
 This week coming to you from our book of the year,

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,820
 2018 Tour Live in Britain.

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,820
 (audience cheering)

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,300
 My name is Dash Shriver and I'm sitting here

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,820
 with Anarch Zinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray,

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,660
 and James Harkin and once again,

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,180
 we have gathered around the microphones

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,020
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,540
 and in a particular order, here we go.

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,820
 Starting with fact number one and that's my fact this week.

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,820
 My fact is Australia's first police force

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,220
 was made up of Australia's 12 best-behaved convicts.

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,020
 (audience laughing)

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,620
 - Wow, it's weird you didn't do this fact

22
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,500
 when we actually were in Australia then.

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,680
 (audience laughing)

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,620
 - And it's weird that we hope to go back again.

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,140
 (audience laughing)

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,220
 - So this is because when they got there,

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,420
 the first fleets that went out to Australia,

28
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,660
 they were very under-prepared.

29
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,380
 They barely brought any agricultural equipment.

30
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,940
 They sort of arrived and just went,

31
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,700
 "Okay, we just need to make do."

32
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,660
 So they had a few people like the Royal Navy

33
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,260
 who were out there, the British Royal Navy,

34
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,140
 who were trying to police a few things,

35
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,740
 but that wasn't their job and it's not what they were doing.

36
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,020
 So they said, "We need a police force."

37
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,740
 And they realized we have no police.

38
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,420
 So they looked around and went,

39
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,020
 "Okay, who are the best-behaved convicts that we've got here?"

40
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,780
 They found these 12 people and they're like,

41
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,780
 "Would you be the police?"

42
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,500
 And they were like, "Yeah, of course, that's it."

43
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,420
 - So dream, what, how do they define best-behaved?

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,180
 I don't know, I use what the 12 best-behaved people

45
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,620
 in society out of all of them.

46
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,940
 - I guess maybe they might be looking at the crimes

47
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,460
 that they were sent over for because the criminals

48
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,540
 that got sent over was for very basic things,

49
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,340
 as we know, is for stealing a bit of bread

50
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,420
 or urinating on the streets or--

51
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,460
 - Well, there are a lot of different things

52
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,300
 you could get sent for.

53
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,140
 - There was a murderers.

54
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,620
 - I made up the urinating on the streets one,

55
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,060
 but I imagine that might have been a thing.

56
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,900
 - So you could get sent there for recommending

57
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,460
 that politicians get paid?

58
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,740
 - No, no, what?

59
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,260
 - You could get sent there for stealing fish,

60
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,140
 for starting a union.

61
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,300
 There was, in 1843, a guy called James Prido

62
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,260
 was transported for bestiality with a donkey.

63
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,540
 And in 1850, Lieutenant Robert Gates

64
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,060
 was sent to Australia for striking Queen Victoria

65
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,580
 with a cane.

66
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,580
 - Wow.

67
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,540
 I agree with that one, do you?

68
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,780
 - With him doing it, with him being sent away.

69
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,220
 - With him being sent to Australia, right?

70
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,740
 - Okay, actually, there were quite a lot of bestialities.

71
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,180
 There's a list. - Sorry, can I just clarify?

72
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,660
 I was not talking about the bestiality one.

73
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,060
 I was talking about--

74
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,660
 - You don't need to feel bad about it, Andy, okay?

75
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,500
 - I don't feel bad about it.

76
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,940
 There's nothing to feel bad about.

77
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:51,260
 - Okay, no, the Australian government actually has a list

78
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,740
 of all the crimes that people were transported for.

79
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,020
 So I was reading through this list

80
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,820
 and there are 13 for bestiality,

81
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,060
 but there are some that are really weird.

82
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,700
 So one is bad notes.

83
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,700
 What does that mean? - Bad notes.

84
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,260
 - Oh. - 27 people for bad notes.

85
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,260
 - Counterfeiting money?

86
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,100
 - Yeah, I guess so.

87
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,620
 - There was, counterfeiting was a separate one, weirdly.

88
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,940
 I also learned a new word.

89
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,780
 It said that about 40 people were done for hammer sucking,

90
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,940
 which I've never heard of.

91
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,060
 - Hammer sucking? - Hammer sucking.

92
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,900
 - Yeah.

93
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,220
 Do you guys know that word?

94
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,060
 - No.

95
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,060
 - So I think this must have just gone out of use.

96
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,780
 It means to break into someone's house

97
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,940
 and assault them with the intention of assaulting them.

98
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,060
 - And it's different to-- - Assault them with the intention

99
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,860
 of assaulting them.

100
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,780
 - Sorry.

101
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,500
 To break into someone's house with the intention

102
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,060
 of assaulting someone and then assault them.

103
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,260
 As opposed to stew-threaf, which people were also sent for.

104
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,580
 - What? - Yeah.

105
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,620
 Stew-threaf.

106
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,500
 These are just words that I'd never heard.

107
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,340
 - Do we know what that is?

108
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,660
 - Yeah, that's breaking into someone's house

109
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,300
 without the intention of assaulting someone,

110
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,740
 but someone pops up so you have to assault them anyway.

111
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,540
 (audience laughing)

112
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,980
 - Oh, it's really hard to prove

113
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,060
 when we were in the house, when you were hammer sucking

114
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,660
 or stew-threaf and-- - In a way you need the victim

115
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,220
 to go, it was my fault really for popping up.

116
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,060
 (audience laughing)

117
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,580
 - That's some very specific ones though.

118
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,100
 So it really goes down to detail, especially with theft.

119
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,820
 There was theft of a hairbrush, one person,

120
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,780
 got sent to Australia for that.

121
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,980
 Theft of six chickens, 17 people.

122
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,220
 17 separate people stole six chickens.

123
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,740
 Theft of bacon, the theft of shovels.

124
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,580
 People are stealing left, right, and center.

125
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,740
 And yeah, they were all getting sent away.

126
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,260
 - So one thing that happened when you boarded

127
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,660
 the transport ships was you got given a bag of cloth

128
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,700
 if you were a woman.

129
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,820
 So Elizabeth Frye, who's the social reformer,

130
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,100
 she's on bank notes now.

131
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,940
 She's on the five pound note.

132
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,460
 She on the current five pound note?

133
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,140
 Think she is. - Anyone?

134
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,540
 - No. - No, all right.

135
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,660
 - Not according to that one man

136
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,780
 who I'm gonna trust, completely.

137
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,500
 (audience laughing)

138
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,020
 - Someone check a five pound note.

139
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,540
 Surely someone has a five pound note.

140
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,620
 - She definitely has been on the five pound note.

141
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,860
 But anyway, she had this kind of social program going,

142
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,420
 which was if you're a woman being transported to Australia,

143
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,340
 as you boarded she or her representatives,

144
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,700
 would give you a bag and it contained lots of scraps

145
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,620
 of cloth and needles and thread.

146
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,860
 And the idea was that you could make a quilt

147
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,780
 on your way over and then sell it when you got there

148
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,100
 to give yourself a tiny financial start.

149
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,380
 - But everyone else has also got a quilt

150
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,140
 'cause they've also been on the boat.

151
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,860
 - You wanna really diversify, don't you?

152
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,900
 - You're just quilt swapping.

153
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,700
 Is it entire society of quilt swapping?

154
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,180
 (laughing)

155
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,220
 - Which was a separate offense.

156
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,460
 You could be sent to Australia for actually.

157
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,940
 - One thing I really love about that is,

158
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,860
 so you were badly behaved in Britain

159
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,500
 and you got sent to Australia.

160
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,540
 But if you were badly behaved in Australia,

161
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,860
 then they'd send you even further to North of Ireland.

162
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,540
 So you go to one more island.

163
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,540
 And I wanna know what happens

164
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,340
 if you're badly behaved in North of Ireland?

165
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,420
 What happens then?

166
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,420
 Back to Britain.

167
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,780
 (laughing)

168
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,900
 - Going around and around.

169
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,660
 Yeah, Northern Ireland was very bad, wasn't it?

170
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,500
 - Yeah, it was horrible.

171
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,900
 - In fact, I think people used to

172
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,740
 on North of Ireland try and commit other crimes

173
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,900
 'cause what you would get is a death penalty.

174
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,700
 And for that, you get sent back to Australia

175
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,580
 and you'd be on death row

176
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,540
 and they thought that's way better

177
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,180
 than this terrible North of Ireland, please.

178
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,020
 - Wow.

179
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,260
 - I've heard of the Cascade's female factory.

180
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,100
 - No.

181
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,140
 - So this was somewhere where again, it was,

182
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,180
 so I think most of the people who were transportable men,

183
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,940
 it was maybe 80%.

184
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,740
 But the Cascade's female factory

185
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,420
 was a kind of workhouse for female convicts

186
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,100
 when they were sent over.

187
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,060
 It was a kind of distillery slash prison.

188
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,260
 And when they were in there,

189
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,780
 they weren't allowed to speak to men, these women.

190
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,340
 But they did devise a scheme

191
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,820
 where they bribed a corrupt water.

192
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,580
 And I swear to God, this is what the source I have says.

193
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,660
 It says, they smuggled love letters

194
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,460
 to the men they wanted to communicate with inside chickens.

195
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,060
 (laughing)

196
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,380
 - No, we know why they were stealing all those chickens.

197
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,420
 (laughing)

198
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,820
 - They smuggled love letters inside chickens.

199
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,660
 - Yeah.

200
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,900
 - They were living chickens or dead chickens.

201
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,780
 - Or were inside.

202
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,740
 - I think it goes in the bit where the egg comes out.

203
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,820
 - Okay, not through the beak or under the wing.

204
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,900
 (laughing)

205
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,740
 - That's what I do.

206
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,900
 - These guys in this factory,

207
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,540
 they famously protested in 1832.

208
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,620
 And the way that they did that

209
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,180
 is the governor of Van Diemensland,

210
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,140
 which is now Tasmania, came along.

211
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,180
 And turning right around, and at one impulse,

212
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,380
 they pulled up their clothes, showing the naked posterias,

213
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,340
 which they simultaneously smacked with their hands,

214
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,260
 making a loud and not very musical noise.

215
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,220
 (laughing)

216
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,860
 And on another occasion,

217
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,020
 some dozen or 20 women seized the governor,

218
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,140
 took off his trousers and deliberately endeavoured

219
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,820
 to deprive him of his manhood.

220
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,660
 - Wow.

221
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,340
 - It's not what you want.

222
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,700
 - Now what happened to the chickens doesn't sound so bad,

223
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,540
 doesn't it?

224
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,820
 (laughing)

225
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,540
 - People always think that I think the people

226
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,980
 that were sent over to Australia, though,

227
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,780
 were kind of from the lowest of the low in society,

228
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,860
 like the really lower class working classes.

229
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,180
 But it was a whole range of people,

230
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,020
 it was basically anyone unwanted in Britain.

231
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,620
 So there was really a good article by Thomas Cannelli,

232
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,060
 you know, the Australian author,

233
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,260
 who was describing the kind of people that would go.

234
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,580
 And he was thinking there was a lot of members

235
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,620
 of the gentry in the bourgeoisie,

236
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,060
 but people who sort of had gambling debts

237
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,460
 or who'd got themselves into trouble,

238
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,620
 or he said bluff English lads who weren't particularly good

239
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,300
 academically or who had impregnated the maid.

240
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,500
 And then you've got to go.

241
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,100
 But do you know, just because, so Ned Kelly

242
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,300
 is obviously relevant to this.

243
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,980
 So this police force was created

244
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,860
 and the police became quite corrupt and hated.

245
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,700
 And then you got these rebels in Australia

246
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,260
 who were kind of hero villains.

247
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,340
 And Ned Kelly is the main one.

248
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,620
 But I didn't know that the world's first feature length film

249
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,180
 was the Kelly Gang.

250
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,500
 So it was the story of the Kelly Gang.

251
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,020
 It was made in 1906, and it was banned almost immediately,

252
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,500
 because it was shown in Australia in cinemas.

253
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,940
 It was super successful.

254
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,780
 And then people started committing kind of imitation crimes.

255
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,180
 So a bunch of kids went and held up a photography warehouse,

256
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,300
 I think, and stole a bunch of stuff from it

257
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,060
 and held up some schoolchildren at gunpoint.

258
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,540
 And what?

259
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,380
 They canceled.

260
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,980
 So everyone was fine.

261
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,180
 So yeah, they canceled it.

262
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,500
 But it was really successful.

263
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,260
 And the reviewers got kind of annoyed about it

264
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,060
 because the way they did films in those days was people

265
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,180
 went to the cinema and they showed the film.

266
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,180
 And they also had a lecturer standing by the side

267
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,060
 of it explaining the action as it happened,

268
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,820
 because obviously no sound.

269
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,580
 And then they had actors behind the screen

270
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,220
 who were giving it the dialogue.

271
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,740
 So--

272
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,340
 Wow.

273
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,300
 --and apparently the Kelly dialogue and sound effects

274
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,060
 were so loud that it really upset people

275
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,020
 who were used to quiet silent films.

276
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,620
 So there was something called the Kelly Belogruf,

277
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,740
 which reviewers referred to, which

278
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,100
 was going to the cinema to see the Ned Kelly film.

279
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,060
 And you just, like, be deffined by these thunder claps

280
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,100
 that they were doing behind the screen.

281
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,940
 I love the idea of a lecturer.

282
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,380
 Just by the side, who's just filling you in on,

283
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,140
 who everyone is, every scene.

284
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,540
 For any Marvel superhero film, I would like that.

285
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,540
 [LAUGHTER]

286
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,060
 Just why are we all trying to get the rocks?

287
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,220
 [LAUGHTER]

288
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,860
 Just speaking of famous Australian convicts

289
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,940
 from that period.

290
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,340
 So Ned Kelly, more an outlaw than a convict initially.

291
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,380
 There was a guy called Moon Dine Joe.

292
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,100
 Moon Dine was the place he was from.

293
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,380
 And this guy, he'd arrived with the boats.

294
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,900
 I don't think it was the very first fleet.

295
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,460
 But he kind of served his sentence there.

296
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,580
 And he was let free.

297
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,540
 And he-- so they must have sorted out that system that--

298
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,700
 oh, so they had a problem with earlier.

299
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,780
 And he started doing things like branding cows for himself

300
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,380
 and keeping them.

301
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,700
 So he got arrested and put back in prison.

302
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,700
 But he escaped.

303
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,540
 So then he got arrested again and put back in prison.

304
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,460
 And then he escaped.

305
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,340
 And then he got arrested again.

306
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,820
 And he just kept escaping.

307
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,420
 And there was nothing that they could do.

308
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,700
 So they eventually had to build him his own custom cell,

309
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,820
 just completely on their own.

310
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,020
 And they said to him that if he escaped that,

311
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,340
 all would be forgiven.

312
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,300
 He's like, you go free.

313
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,580
 We don't know what to do with you if you were escaped.

314
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,100
 Wow.

315
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,700
 Did he escape?

316
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,420
 You're not going to believe this.

317
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,940
 I forgot to write down the answers to that.

318
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,420
 Oh, my God.

319
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,700
 [LAUGHTER]

320
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,140
 When in that story did you realize that you didn't have the answer?

321
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,420
 You knew when I was going, and then he escaped.

322
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,980
 And then he was in that moment.

323
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,460
 I think I saw it in a few more escapes.

324
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,140
 So this is where my lecturer system will be able to sweep it

325
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,020
 and say he did not escape.

326
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,740
 I looked up modern Aussie police.

327
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,740
 Oh, yeah.

328
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,900
 It might be interesting to see what they're up to.

329
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,180
 So there's a town in Queensland called Birdsville.

330
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,180
 And it's amazing.

331
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,540
 So it has one police officer.

332
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,620
 And it's Birdsville and the surrounding region.

333
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,420
 And his jurisdiction is the same size as the United Kingdom.

334
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,340
 Wow.

335
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,780
 It's 93,000 square miles.

336
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,300
 Wow.

337
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,060
 What does he do?

338
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,940
 He drives around.

339
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,740
 He drives a lot.

340
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,340
 [LAUGHTER]

341
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,540
 A lot of mileage expenses, yeah.

342
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,300
 So because it's a tiny town.

343
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,380
 It says the population signs say the population is 115

344
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,780
 plus or minus 7,000.

345
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,620
 Because there's a horse race in September,

346
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,340
 which brings a lot of tourists.

347
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,420
 So almost all year it's 115, and then September is 7,000.

348
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,940
 And Buzzfeed wrote this huge long piece all about him,

349
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,940
 and they interviewed him.

350
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,420
 And the piece says about Birdsville.

351
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,340
 If you want to buy a coffee, you have one option,

352
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,500
 the Birdsville Bakery.

353
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,620
 If you want to visit a restaurant,

354
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,780
 you have one option, the Birdsville Hotel.

355
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,500
 If you want to see a film or live music,

356
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,660
 you are in the wrong town.

357
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,060
 [LAUGHTER]

358
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,100
 Well, he's not getting re-employed by the tourist

359
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,980
 department for Birdsville.

360
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,860
 What are you saying?

361
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,980
 As I was Googling all this stuff and Googling Australia,

362
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,660
 I found something that I just want to share,

363
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,500
 even though it's not really on topic.

364
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,220
 And it was a new story that a 21-year-old Australian

365
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,460
 has been labelled the unluckiest man in Australia,

366
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,820
 after he was bitten by a spider on the penis

367
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,380
 for the second time in five months.

368
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,380
 [LAUGHTER]

369
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,740
 It was his first visit to a portable toilet

370
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,860
 since his last encounter with a spider.

371
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,220
 [LAUGHTER]

372
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,060
 It was the same spider.

373
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,940
 It saw him coming in as well.

374
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,460
 I'm going to get you again.

375
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,500
 [LAUGHTER]

376
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,740
 Oh, my God.

377
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,740
 Oh, my God.

378
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,700
 His family, honestly, it'll be fine.

379
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,340
 It's a $1 billion chance.

380
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,300
 Oh, the worst thing, I mean, this is so sad.

381
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,420
 But he went to the hospital, and all the nurses

382
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,700
 remembered him from the last time.

383
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,500
 [LAUGHTER]

384
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,060
 Should we move on to what you think is just what

385
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,740
 the Aussie police these days have to deal with.

386
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,420
 I just looked up recent Australian crimes.

387
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,380
 And there was one who was a man who was a drunk driver

388
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,500
 who started driving laps around the car park

389
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,460
 of a Sydney branch of McDonald's after they

390
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:32,020
 refused to sell him 200 chicken nuggets at 5 a.m. on Remembrance Day.

391
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,180
 He started screaming, I want my effing nuggets.

392
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,340
 I'm going to eff you up.

393
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,940
 He drove around a load of laps before changing his mind

394
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,860
 and asking for 200 hash browns in stakes.

395
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,100
 It was breakfast time.

396
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,040
 Police were called, but before they made a sure rest

397
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,940
 in, the perpetrator had demanded a refund,

398
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,740
 but was unable to remember what he had ordered

399
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,540
 and wanted a refund for.

400
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,460
 [LAUGHTER]

401
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,500
 Not for nothing, did those brave men and women

402
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,380
 sacrifice themselves?

403
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,140
 Anyway, we hope to be touring Australia again next year.

404
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,340
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinsky.

405
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,660
 My fact this week is that in the first newspaper crosswords,

406
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,500
 the answers did not have to be actual words.

407
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,100
 So this is just this so weird thing.

408
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,780
 I was reading the telegraph released a book of the history

409
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,580
 of its own crosswords, and it talks about their first crosswords,

410
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,780
 which was in 1925.

411
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,500
 And I think that was pretty much the earliest newspaper crosswords

412
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,220
 in the UK was in 1925.

413
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,460
 And you would have clues like, I don't know how much, if one

414
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,540
 knows about cryptic crosswords, I assume everything.

415
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,380
 Stop it, everyone.

416
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,300
 If you've gone an anagram in a cryptic crossword,

417
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,260
 you'll have a word like muddle or mix up, which

418
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,380
 shows you it's an anagram.

419
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,420
 And then you know you've got to mix up the letters.

420
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,740
 But in one of these early crosswords,

421
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,500
 the clue was just a muddled life.

422
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,660
 And the answer was ilf-ilf-e, not a real word, or--

423
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,420
 [LAUGHTER]

424
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,700
 You want to show me its file, and you've just got it wrong.

425
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,500
 It's ilf.

426
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,580
 It's ilf otherwise it didn't work.

427
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,420
 Another one I liked, and this really is for the cryptic fans,

428
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,620
 so apologies, everyone else.

429
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,500
 But this has its tail dislocated.

430
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,740
 It means you take the word this, and you take the tail of it,

431
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,500
 which is the end, which is the s, and you just

432
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,140
 the case it, and put it on the front.

433
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,220
 So the answer was c-thee.

434
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,180
 [LAUGHTER]

435
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,940
 But there was a moral panic about crosswords

436
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,460
 when they were first really popular.

437
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,140
 So the first modern crossword was in a New York world,

438
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,780
 which was a magazine in 1913.

439
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,020
 But in the '20s, they became really popular.

440
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,900
 And in 1924, the New York Times said that they were a sinful waste.

441
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,140
 And they said that the utterly futile finding of words

442
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,860
 was a primitive sort of mental exercise.

443
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,940
 But they added, fortunately, the question

444
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,900
 of whether the puzzles are beneficial or harmful

445
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,820
 is in no urgent need of an answer.

446
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,980
 The craze is evidently dying out fast.

447
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,300
 In a few months, it will be forgotten.

448
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,740
 They also had the libraries of New York

449
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,380
 complained that people doing crosswords were ruining

450
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,580
 libraries because they were coming in and dominating

451
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,180
 all the dictionaries when people who actually wanted

452
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,100
 to use dictionaries were not able to get there to use them.

453
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,220
 So they released a statement saying that the puzzle fans

454
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,860
 swarmed to the dictionaries and encyclopedias.

455
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,740
 So as to driveway readers and students

456
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,540
 who need these books and they're daily work,

457
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,300
 can there be any doubt that the library's duty to protect

458
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,900
 its legitimate readers?

459
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,980
 And it was basically-- yeah, this is the death of libraries,

460
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,700
 because these crosswords--

461
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,220
 As we've just learned, a dictionary is useless to you,

462
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,980
 filling out old crosswords, so what are they doing?

463
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,980
 There was a psychologist from Columbia University

464
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,620
 who said that crossword puzzles-- and this

465
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,660
 was around the same time-- he said the reason they're so

466
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,140
 popular is that crossword puzzles satisfied the 45

467
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,500
 fundamental desires of the human species.

468
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,060
 Not all 45.

469
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,860
 Well, I looked at a longer list of fundamental desires

470
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,740
 I could find, and it included curiosity, which, I think,

471
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,620
 is fair, order, like point things in order about works,

472
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:19,620
 physical activity, kind of, maybe, romance, no romance.

473
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,860
 I've not in any crossword I've completed.

474
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,380
 No, vengeance.

475
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,100
 Actually, yes, vengeance, as we can see, yeah.

476
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,060
 I think you're doing it wrong.

477
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,740
 And definitely doing it wrong, eating.

478
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,700
 That's what you do at the end.

479
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,100
 That's why they're always on rice paper.

480
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,500
 There was apparently people started writing into zoos

481
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,060
 and demanding of the zookeepers to know a three-letter word,

482
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,540
 which meant a female swan, and things like that.

483
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,940
 Yeah, because back in the day, I guess

484
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,700
 there was no internet to just sort of when you've given up.

485
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,220
 Exactly.

486
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,700
 You just had to write to a zookeeper.

487
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,980
 Yeah.

488
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,260
 That reminds me.

489
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,820
 And there was no internet as well.

490
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,980
 And there was a new story.

491
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,140
 Maybe one of you guys found it.

492
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,980
 I haven't written it down, but it was--

493
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,260
 there was a guy in the UK somewhere,

494
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,420
 and he was doing a crossword.

495
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,820
 He was about 80 years old, but he had the internet.

496
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,660
 It was about five or 10 years ago.

497
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,780
 And the question was, Asian Ass.

498
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,580
 And he decided to look it up on the internet.

499
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,140
 Oh, no.

500
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,420
 And he said, basically, he didn't know this kind of thing existed.

501
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,780
 Although it does rather sound like his wife came down

502
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,540
 and said, what are you looking at?

503
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,420
 Yeah.

504
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,700
 Apparently going through 1,000 crosswords

505
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:33,060
 to find any clue which might explain it.

506
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,340
 I found a crossword that I really like.

507
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,860
 It's an art piece, which has been displayed in art galleries.

508
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,020
 And it was lent to Nuremberg's Newers Museum.

509
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,540
 And it was up there.

510
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:49,100
 And a 90-year-old woman went to see it and filled it in.

511
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,220
 And it was worth 68,000 pounds.

512
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,820
 And it is surely worth more when it's completed.

513
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,500
 Well, her argument is it's fine.

514
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,700
 In that case, I've got some crossword books to sell you.

515
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,180
 [LAUGHTER]

516
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,140
 This one's worth a fortune, and it's completely completed.

517
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,580
 It's a pretty good point.

518
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,580
 Yeah, no.

519
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,260
 She only got a couple in before someone noticed

520
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,740
 that she was writing on a bit of art on the wall.

521
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,620
 And so, yeah, so she got in trouble.

522
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,020
 They raised out her contribution to it.

523
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,940
 But she has claimed that she now holds copyright

524
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,820
 because it's a new work.

525
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,420
 She's now a collaborator.

526
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,220
 Right.

527
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,220
 We'll fill through all Avengers.

528
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,900
 You're right, yeah.

529
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,820
 I like-- so crossword setters are always kind of heroes.

530
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,900
 But one of the first ones was Arthur Winn.

531
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,540
 I think he was the first one who set the New York World One.

532
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,420
 And the first crossword puzzle he set to try and convince

533
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,100
 his publishers-- this is the thing worth doing--

534
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,380
 the new type of publishers.

535
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,140
 He-- the word dove appeared twice.

536
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,660
 So it's the first ever crossword.

537
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,340
 You've got the entire dictionary and non-dictionary,

538
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,940
 apparently, at your disposal.

539
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,460
 And he couldn't think of something that wasn't dove

540
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,460
 for that second clue.

541
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,140
 One was at the same clue, or--

542
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,580
 No, one clue was bird, and one was pigeon.

543
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,260
 [LAUGHTER]

544
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,580
 Yep, couldn't-- and then the other words were just bizarre.

545
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,700
 It had the word nafe, female surf.

546
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,620
 And then it also had doff as in Homer Simpson.

547
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,380
 Don't know, right?

548
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:15,900
 Yeah.

549
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,420
 Wow.

550
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,860
 It was the original dove.

551
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,380
 What was the clue?

552
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,060
 It was Homer Simpson's catchphrase.

553
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,980
 [LAUGHTER]

554
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,500
 Wow.

555
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,580
 How do they work, they back in the day?

556
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,540
 And he-- do you know what he published it as?

557
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,700
 It wasn't called a crossword.

558
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,260
 Oh, it was called-- it was called a word cross.

559
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,340
 Yeah, that was the original.

560
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,020
 At some point down the line, we went better the other way, man.

561
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,940
 No, it wasn't that.

562
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,340
 It was a few weeks later.

563
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,420
 It was a mess up in the type setting.

564
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,420
 Really?

565
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,820
 Switched it round to crossword as a guy way.

566
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,820
 And the guy way.

567
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,780
 [LAUGHTER]

568
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:56,580
 Actually, just on that weird words, there was a guy called--

569
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,180
 an editor called Arthur Maurice, who noticed that the words

570
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,020
 that Americans were using in the late 1920s

571
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,580
 were a lot shorter and had more vowels in them

572
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,140
 than they were before that.

573
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,020
 And he put it down to the crossword craze.

574
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,020
 Basically, he's saying, if you're writing crosswords,

575
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,500
 you need lots of these small words, like Doha or whatever.

576
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,140
 And actually, he noticed that more people

577
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,940
 are using words such as a bet, acute, adept,

578
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,940
 eek, elan, eon, things like that.

579
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,460
 Right.

580
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,180
 So it actually changed the way that people speak.

581
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,740
 What were the four people saying?

582
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,300
 Oh, Zephyr and Oh, Rhythm.

583
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,540
 And I kind of think of a single other word, which is--

584
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,220
 That would only be "Constance."

585
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,220
 It's just like, pal, crystal palace.

586
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,460
 Yeah, crystal palace.

587
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,620
 Crystal.

588
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,540
 I still can't believe they're the longest words

589
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,780
 that your two collective minds can come up with.

590
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,780
 Consonance.

591
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,540
 Just loads of consonants.

592
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,900
 Could a consonant have been heavy?

593
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,980
 Please, the floor of the walls.

594
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,980
 [LAUGHTER]

595
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,820
 Latch, don't.

596
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,460
 Don't help her with crosswords at the moment.

597
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,020
 You're not allowed to use crosswords at the moment.

598
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,100
 It's drink-neen.

599
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,860
 Right, surely.

600
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,660
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]

601
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,660
 You're right.

602
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,700
 Lots of setters have their own characteristics,

603
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,620
 and they all have their own not-powers.

604
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,140
 But their own ideas are really--

605
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,820
 I really don't understand the Marvel movies, do you?

606
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,620
 I thought it was so little crossword action in the later one.

607
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,540
 I'm tempted not to go back.

608
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,060
 There are a few than a hundred professional crossword

609
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,460
 setters in the UK, for me three reasons.

610
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,180
 It's quite a niche thing to be doing.

611
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,180
 But there is one setter called Mark Bremen.

612
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,820
 And this year, he launched what he said

613
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,460
 was the hardest in the world.

614
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,580
 He estimated that it would take two years to complete.

615
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,500
 He said, I'm not saying that this crossword cannot be completed,

616
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,900
 because, of course, it can.

617
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,700
 But nonetheless, it is finitially tough

618
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,500
 and significantly harder than anything

619
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,140
 I've ever compiled before.

620
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,540
 Based on the feedback of other compilers who have seen it

621
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,140
 or tried it, mine is about 100 times harder.

622
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,980
 If that description is indeed correct,

623
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,500
 then it stands to reason that it would

624
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,580
 take the average enthusiast a hundred times longer to solve it.

625
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,700
 This amounts to 100 weeks or just over two years.

626
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,820
 It was solved within two hours.

627
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,540
 [LAUGHTER]

628
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,300
 He hadn't even finished that speech.

629
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,820
 [LAUGHTER]

630
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,740
 To be honest, I lost faith in him when he said,

631
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,980
 it amounts to 100 weeks or just over two years.

632
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,460
 [LAUGHTER]

633
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,940
 That's when he knows he's got some miscalculations going on.

634
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,740
 The guy he solved it said, some of the clues were definitely

635
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,740
 tricky, but two years would be a stretch.

636
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,940
 [LAUGHTER]

637
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,100
 Just on the question setters, the New York Times

638
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,900
 had quite a fun run last year of a whole year

639
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,700
 of celebrity question setters.

640
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,340
 So Bill Clinton wrote a crossword for them.

641
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,860
 And my favorite one, Weird Al Yankovich wrote one.

642
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,900
 If you guys remember Weird Al Yankovich, he wrote one.

643
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,820
 So his was mainly filled with cheese-based puns.

644
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,140
 So he, like, answers that were allowed with fetter attraction

645
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,060
 and a few good men.

646
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,580
 Yeah.

647
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,700
 But interestingly, they set rules to it.

648
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,420
 So he was disqualified when he tried to get a clue

649
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,780
 in where the answer was, fondue the right thing.

650
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,700
 And they said, we have strict cheeses

651
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,380
 that you're allowed to use in this crossword.

652
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,580
 And fondue is not a cheese.

653
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,340
 It's a style.

654
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,540
 So if you're doing a cheese crossword,

655
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,020
 you have to really stick within the cheese category.

656
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,860
 Yeah, it has to be just a cheese, I guess, within the word.

657
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,700
 Yogg, that's mostly consonants.

658
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,740
 [LAUGHTER]

659
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,300
 Didn't know you were still playing that game.

660
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,100
 I'm going to be playing it all the way home, eh?

661
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,820
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

662
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,620
 My fact is that in the German Renaissance,

663
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,220
 it was briefly fashionable for women

664
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,980
 to have themselves painted as a biblical character halfway

665
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,980
 through decapitating a man.

666
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:43,580
 So there's this biblical story, which is of Judith and Halophanes.

667
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,380
 I think that's how it's pronounced.

668
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,780
 But he's dead, so it doesn't matter.

669
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,940
 There's a biblical story of Judith and Halophanes.

670
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,300
 And Halophanes is a very brutal general who

671
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,580
 is about to destroy Judith's home city.

672
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,340
 And he's outside the city.

673
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,420
 She is a widow, and he lets her into his tent

674
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,580
 because he fancies her, basically.

675
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,660
 And she comes in, and she gets him drunk.

676
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,860
 He passes out, and she decapitates him.

677
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,100
 And she takes the head away in a basket.

678
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,860
 So she's quite a heroic figure.

679
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,540
 This is Old Testament stuff, obviously.

680
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,020
 And there was an artist in the German Renaissance

681
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,940
 called Kranach, Lucas Kranach, the elder.

682
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,580
 And he painted eight different versions of this scene.

683
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,780
 So loads of artists have painted it.

684
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,100
 Caravaggio did it.

685
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,620
 Dozens and dozens of artists have painted it over the centuries.

686
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,300
 But there are at least eight different tutors that he painted.

687
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,980
 And they're all wearing modern dress.

688
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,060
 And they've all got completely different looks.

689
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,300
 And we now believe that several different women

690
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,740
 in the Saxon court commissioned paintings of themselves

691
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,500
 halfway through to capitating a man.

692
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,340
 That's so cool.

693
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,020
 And we should clarify, when you say modern dress,

694
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,940
 you mean the modern dress of the time?

695
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,900
 No, no, no, no.

696
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,900
 I mean, they were in modern 21st century power business suits.

697
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,740
 That's-- it speaks to sort of a burgeoning angry feminism,

698
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,460
 doesn't it, that women have suddenly gone,

699
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,860
 God, I'm allowed to be painted to capitating somebody.

700
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,780
 Brilliant.

701
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,740
 And this, just for anyone who thinks they don't recognize this

702
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,620
 from the Bible, it's not in the Protestant version

703
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,140
 of the Old Testament that people use.

704
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,020
 It is in the Catholic version.

705
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,980
 And most people think that it's--

706
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
 I mean, what they think of the whole Bible, I don't know.

707
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,220
 But everyone knows that this is non-historical.

708
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,420
 And some people have called it the first historical novel,

709
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,980
 because it's so obviously not true,

710
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,660
 because there's a lot of anachronisms

711
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,620
 and, you know, nebuchadesses in here.

712
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,860
 Andachronisms, she's wearing a wrist watch at one point.

713
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,140
 It doesn't stack up.

714
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,660
 A seven-four, seven flew over her, and this is implausible.

715
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,100
 Did you know, just speaking of a fashion in art,

716
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,580
 a fashion in art for painting Mary Magdalene,

717
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,580
 covered in hair from head to toe?

718
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
 No.

719
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,580
 This is so weird.

720
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,660
 Well, like a big foot.

721
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,700
 Yep.

722
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,700
 She looks like a Yeti.

723
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,340
 And this is a trend in medieval art,

724
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,860
 pictures of Mary Magdalene, a covered in hair.

725
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,540
 And it's because she was sort of often referred

726
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,420
 to as having very long hair, and it sort of covered her

727
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,100
 genitals sometimes in art.

728
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,740
 And it seemed to grow out of that in some versions

729
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,300
 of the telling of her story.

730
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,660
 It was that after Jesus died, then she became a desert hermit

731
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,860
 and repentant of her prostitution and stuff.

732
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,340
 And she stopped caring about her parents at all,

733
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,140
 so all of her clothes fell off eventually.

734
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,620
 And then a sort of a mercy god covered her in hair.

735
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,580
 And there were these paintings of her all over medieval art.

736
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,740
 And she looks like a Yeti.

737
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,540
 I don't know.

738
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,900
 She's covered in hair, head to toe,

739
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,500
 but with a face of skin.

740
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,820
 That's so weird.

741
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,820
 And also they used to paint Moses with horns, didn't they?

742
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,060
 They did.

743
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:47,380
 And they reckon that that was maybe a mis-translation or something?

744
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,740
 Yeah, they thought it was a Bible mis-translation

745
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,940
 because it was describing him coming down the mountains.

746
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,340
 And so they were doing it purely out of we think

747
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,460
 that this is what was written.

748
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,140
 So there's a word that is Karen, like the name Karen.

749
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,900
 And in Hebrew it can either mean horn or ray of light.

750
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,420
 So he came down with a ray of light in the Bible,

751
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,260
 but some guy misread it and just went,

752
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,980
 "I probably had horns."

753
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,700
 There is a painter called Daphne Todd.

754
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,780
 And she is a modern portrait painter.

755
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,900
 And she revealed a few years ago that she was commissioned

756
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,580
 to paint someone who was extremely rude

757
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,220
 and extremely uncooperative all the way

758
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,140
 through the portrait painting process.

759
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,260
 And as a result, she has given that man a pair of horns

760
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:29,420
 in the painting and then painted over it with his hair.

761
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,180
 But in 50 or 100 years' time, it's going to be revealed

762
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,660
 that this guy has horns in the painting.

763
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,900
 So other fashions from Renaissance time.

764
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,940
 The Chalping or Chalping, it was a platform shoe

765
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,100
 that they wore, especially around Venice.

766
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,300
 And the idea was, you are it over your shoes

767
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,140
 because the ground was terrible.

768
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,380
 There was loads of poo around them, loads of mud and stuff like that.

769
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,380
 You don't want it on your shoes.

770
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,780
 You don't want it on your dress.

771
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,340
 And so they got these nice high platforms.

772
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,860
 But then it kind of turned out that the higher you got,

773
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,460
 the better your status was.

774
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,700
 And they got higher and higher and higher and higher.

775
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,020
 And eventually, they were getting examples

776
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:11,860
 that were over 20 inches high platform shoes in Venice.

777
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,940
 So just to put that into context, that would put Anna,

778
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,220
 if you wore them, three inches taller than LeBron James,

779
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,340
 a basketball player.

780
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,180
 [LAUGHTER]

781
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,780
 But it is so hard to run up a basketball court in 20 years.

782
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,460
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

783
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,420
 And that is James.

784
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,980
 OK, my fact this week is that mice can't hear their own footsteps.

785
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,220
 [LAUGHTER]

786
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,660
 Now, is this because they are quite deaf,

787
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,260
 or because they walk very quietly?

788
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,860
 It's because they're selectively deaf.

789
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:49,100
 So there is a noise that happens when a mouse walks.

790
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,060
 And in theory, it could hear it.

791
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,300
 But its brain just goes, now I'm not going to listen to that.

792
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,660
 And it just turns it off.

793
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,980
 And it could be that this is true of actually all animals.

794
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,020
 And maybe a few humans as well.

795
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,940
 Like if you walk down the street, you don't really

796
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,780
 notice your own footsteps.

797
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,540
 But let's say you're walking on some gravel

798
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,860
 or some leaves or something, you might hear it.

799
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,740
 And this is a new study that's recently

800
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,420
 been done by Janani Sundarajan and Richard

801
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,660
 Muni at Duke's School of Medicine.

802
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,660
 And what they did was they put little buttons

803
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,220
 on the bottom of a mouse's feet.

804
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,020
 And so as it went to long, it just made little--

805
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,020
 beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

806
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,620
 Wow.

807
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,780
 It's like a little beeping noise.

808
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,340
 Like, you know that movie big when he's on the keyboard.

809
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,420
 Isn't it like that?

810
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,460
 But it was the same note every time.

811
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,100
 And they checked the brain of the mouse.

812
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,300
 And they realized that it could hear this--

813
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,940
 it's reacting to this noise.

814
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,140
 But then as it went on after a week or two,

815
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,940
 it wasn't reacting to it anymore.

816
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,740
 I bet the other mice were still reacting to it.

817
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,020
 [LAUGHTER]

818
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,340
 And what they found was is that basically the mice

819
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,660
 had been trained to just not listen to the sound anymore.

820
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,780
 And it's just natural in their brains.

821
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,780
 And the ones which had got used to this sound,

822
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,780
 they were much better than other mice at reacting to predators.

823
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,340
 So if you had like a cat paw come in to get them.

824
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,620
 The ones who couldn't hear their own footsteps

825
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,420
 could get out of there.

826
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,220
 But the ones who could hear them would pot off.

827
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,820
 They reckon that this maybe is why humans, possibly,

828
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,340
 not the animals, can't hear your own footsteps.

829
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:17,860
 Yeah.

830
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,380
 I guess the human brain is very good at zoning stuff out

831
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,860
 that is for pieces, right?

832
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,180
 Yeah, so if you're a heavy breather, for instance,

833
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,060
 you wouldn't necessarily know you were a heavy breather.

834
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,420
 Everyone else would know that you were doing it,

835
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,780
 but you wouldn't necessarily know what--

836
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,060
 I mean, the people you were phoning up would know, wouldn't they?

837
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,740
 Yeah, I mean, like you would know if you were a heavy breather,

838
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,660
 wouldn't you?

839
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,820
 And then you would know.

840
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,820
 Yeah.

841
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,980
 Oh, what are you--

842
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,500
 sorry, what are you saying?

843
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,460
 You were an extremely heavy breather.

844
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,980
 That's not a heavy breather.

845
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,220
 We don't need to go into it now.

846
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,140
 No, we're normal breather.

847
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,900
 You're fired.

848
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,340
 It's very distracting in the office.

849
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:58,740
 But yeah, I think that's it.

850
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,460
 Can I just ask for the--

851
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,660
 just to make sure I get this clear.

852
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,620
 So by cancelling out the noise, it means

853
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,700
 that every other dangerous noise is amplified,

854
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,660
 and they don't cross fire with their own noise.

855
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,060
 Yeah, not amplified so much as you're just easier to hear

856
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,740
 because you're not being constantly

857
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,860
 annoyed by the sound of your own footsteps.

858
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,380
 Yes.

859
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,340
 So this is the thing with conversation in humans.

860
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,380
 As in when your-- it's why it's quite tricky to develop

861
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,260
 really good, kind of artificially intelligent hearing

862
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,900
 implants is because listening to the human brain

863
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,100
 has an amazing ability to identify a voice in a lot of other noise.

864
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,940
 Yeah.

865
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,660
 Yeah, but it does get harder when you've

866
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,180
 got a human voice against the background

867
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,580
 of a lot of other human voices.

868
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,700
 So this gets called the cocktail party problem,

869
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,540
 where it's quite hard to focus on an individual voice.

870
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,580
 And which gets worse with age, as we know.

871
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,420
 So one's parents will not be able to be in a loud room.

872
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,340
 But the cocktail party problem is--

873
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,900
 It does feel like you've just stopped them from being in a loud room.

874
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,500
 You wouldn't enjoy it.

875
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,220
 Andy's in there.

876
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,020
 He's breathing.

877
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,020
 You just--

878
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,300
 [LAUGHTER]

879
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,500
 You could see pins and things going flying

880
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,220
 past with my huge breath.

881
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,260
 [LAUGHTER]

882
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,420
 And the cocktail party effects was described

883
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,780
 by both someone called Colin Cherry.

884
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,900
 I think it was in the '50s or the '60s, possibly the '60s.

885
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,100
 And the way he tested it was, he played two sentences

886
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,660
 to the study participants, one in one ear and one in the other ear.

887
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,340
 And he told them to listen to only one of them.

888
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,300
 So he told them which one to listen to.

889
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,820
 And then he'd ask some questions about each sentence.

890
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,340
 And it was the case that the one they hadn't

891
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,540
 been told to listen to, they couldn't really tell him anything about it.

892
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,340
 To the extent that if the other voice,

893
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,460
 the other sentence in their ear, was in a different language,

894
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,780
 they very often hadn't even noticed that.

895
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,460
 So that's how good we are at zoning out the stuff we're not

896
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,500
 supposed to be listening to.

897
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,020
 Yeah.

898
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,660
 And this is also called that because I think this is right

899
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,860
 that you hear, if someone says your name,

900
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,500
 you kind of just hear that really, really loud

901
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,220
 if you're in a cocktail party.

902
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,620
 Or in fact, very bad advice for a cocktail party.

903
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,620
 A discovery that was made recently,

904
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,540
 if someone speaks who you love, then you'll hear them.

905
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,300
 So they did this study where they

906
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,940
 exposed people to a lot of peripheral sound.

907
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,660
 And then they have someone they don't

908
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,900
 know say something to them.

909
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,460
 And then they have their spouse say something to them.

910
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,060
 And people are much, much better at understanding

911
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,580
 and hearing what their spouses said.

912
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,060
 Hang on, sorry.

913
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,580
 Do we know what the reason for that is?

914
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,740
 Is it just--

915
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,700
 They haven't speculated.

916
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,140
 It's quite new, but I--

917
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,140
 Evolutionally?

918
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:24,820
 Maybe.

919
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,420
 Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, because the one

920
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,020
 you want to reproduce with, so--

921
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,140
 They are going home.

922
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,380
 [LAUGHTER]

923
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:37,420
 It's important to get that message when it comes to you.

924
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,860
 Plants can hear themselves being eaten.

925
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,700
 What?

926
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,660
 That is dark.

927
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,820
 Yeah.

928
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,660
 Hang on.

929
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,740
 Think about that halfway through your next salad.

930
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,780
 They can sense the vibrations caused

931
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,940
 by, for example, a caterpillar eating their leaves.

932
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,500
 Yeah, so I think, for instance, let's say

933
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,300
 there's a plant being eaten by a caterpillar.

934
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,700
 They can sense it, as you say.

935
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,020
 And then they'll give off some defense.

936
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,740
 Exactly.

937
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,580
 So scientists tested this by putting

938
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,500
 some caterpillars on a cabbage plant.

939
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,900
 They recorded the sounds of the caterpillars going,

940
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,100
 ow, ow, ow, ow.

941
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,300
 And then they played--

942
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,740
 [LAUGHTER]

943
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,300
 That was a lot of that.

944
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,700
 That was a really good impression.

945
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,420
 Yeah, I thought it was.

946
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,380
 I think you're going to be on the audio book of the very

947
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,220
 hungry caterpillar.

948
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,220
 [LAUGHTER]

949
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,140
 But what's with the caterpillar's breathing problem

950
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,060
 in this audio book?

951
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,060
 [LAUGHTER]

952
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,420
 Is this the very asthmatic caterpillar?

953
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,700
 It's the very sexy caterpillar we like.

954
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,380
 [LAUGHTER]

955
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,660
 Did you get to the end of that?

956
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,020
 No.

957
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,700
 They put the caterpillars on a cabbage plant.

958
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,540
 They recorded the sounds of the meeting.

959
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,460
 And then they played the vibrations back

960
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,540
 to a group of plants who were not actually

961
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,180
 being eaten by caterpillars.

962
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,020
 And those plants heard those vibrations,

963
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,340
 and they thought, I'm being eaten.

964
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,340
 Wow.

965
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,300
 So I don't know if your actual salad

966
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,420
 will be able to detect and protect itself.

967
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,340
 I think the salad is generally dead.

968
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,140
 Yeah.

969
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,300
 Although, like a carrot, for instance,

970
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,220
 a carrot often can be alive when you eat it,

971
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,700
 and you can see that by the fact that if you cut the top off

972
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,340
 and then put it in some water, it'll grow.

973
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,940
 So yeah, that could do.

974
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,140
 I have a fact about the relationship between your eyes

975
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,140
 and your ears.

976
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,180
 When you move your eyes, your ear drums move too.

977
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,500
 And we don't know why.

978
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,380
 So if you sit where you are, and you just look straight ahead

979
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,660
 of you, and you flick your eyes left and right, OK?

980
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,620
 Your ear drums are rotating with your eyes.

981
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,300
 Wow.

982
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,300
 Yeah.

983
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,700
 And no one knows why.

984
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,340
 And this is the amazing thing.

985
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:38,220
 The ear drums actually move 10 milliseconds before your eyes do.

986
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,380
 What's that?

987
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,580
 So the brain is saying--

988
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,380
 No, they're controlling the eyes.

989
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,020
 The brain is saying, well, they're not controlling it.

990
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,980
 The brain's controlling everything.

991
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,420
 But the brain says, I'm going to move the eyes.

992
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,820
 So ear drums, please get into position.

993
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,260
 Can I not trick it, and so just like--

994
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,100
 [LAUGHTER]

995
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,300
 Because you are--

996
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,700
 I don't know if you're clever than your own brain.

997
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,700
 [LAUGHTER]

998
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,180
 I reckon James thinks he is.

1000
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,940
 That is amazing.

1001
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,900
 He has been holding me but my whole life.

1002
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,220

1003
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,140
 OK, that's it.

1024
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,140
 So, James, have you got our winner?

1025
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,660
 No, he doesn't.

1026
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,060
 No, he doesn't have a house.

1027
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,740
 Oh, Anna.

1028
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,100
 OK.

1029
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,260
 So there's a great fact that there was a British man

1030
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,300
 who changed his name to Tim--

 That's awesome.

1036
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,620
 You nailed it.

1037
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,740
 OK, that's it.

1038
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,820
 That is all of our facts.
