00:00:12,00:00:15,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:15,00:00:18,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast."
00:00:18,00:00:20,"This week coming to you from our book of the year,"
00:00:20,00:00:22,2018 Tour Live in Britain.
00:00:22,00:00:25,(audience cheering)
00:00:25,00:00:29,My name is Dash Shriver and I'm sitting here
00:00:29,00:00:31,"with Anarch Zinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:31,00:00:33,"and James Harkin and once again,"
00:00:33,00:00:35,we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:35,00:00:38,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:38,00:00:41,"and in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:41,00:00:44,Starting with fact number one and that's my fact this week.
00:00:44,00:00:47,My fact is Australia's first police force
00:00:47,00:00:52,was made up of Australia's 12 best-behaved convicts.
00:00:52,00:00:55,(audience laughing)
00:00:55,00:00:56,"- Wow, it's weird you didn't do this fact"
00:00:56,00:00:58,when we actually were in Australia then.
00:00:58,00:00:59,(audience laughing)
00:00:59,00:01:01,- And it's weird that we hope to go back again.
00:01:01,00:01:03,(audience laughing)
00:01:03,00:01:05,"- So this is because when they got there,"
00:01:05,00:01:07,"the first fleets that went out to Australia,"
00:01:07,00:01:08,they were very under-prepared.
00:01:08,00:01:11,They barely brought any agricultural equipment.
00:01:11,00:01:12,"They sort of arrived and just went,"
00:01:12,00:01:14,"""Okay, we just need to make do."""
00:01:14,00:01:16,So they had a few people like the Royal Navy
00:01:16,00:01:18,"who were out there, the British Royal Navy,"
00:01:18,00:01:20,"who were trying to police a few things,"
00:01:20,00:01:22,but that wasn't their job and it's not what they were doing.
00:01:22,00:01:24,"So they said, ""We need a police force."""
00:01:24,00:01:25,And they realized we have no police.
00:01:25,00:01:27,"So they looked around and went,"
00:01:27,00:01:30,"""Okay, who are the best-behaved convicts that we've got here?"""
00:01:30,00:01:31,"They found these 12 people and they're like,"
00:01:31,00:01:33,"""Would you be the police?"""
00:01:33,00:01:36,"And they were like, ""Yeah, of course, that's it."""
00:01:36,00:01:39,"- So dream, what, how do they define best-behaved?"
00:01:39,00:01:41,"I don't know, I use what the 12 best-behaved people"
00:01:41,00:01:42,in society out of all of them.
00:01:42,00:01:44,- I guess maybe they might be looking at the crimes
00:01:44,00:01:47,that they were sent over for because the criminals
00:01:47,00:01:49,"that got sent over was for very basic things,"
00:01:49,00:01:51,"as we know, is for stealing a bit of bread"
00:01:51,00:01:55,or urinating on the streets or--
00:01:55,00:01:56,"- Well, there are a lot of different things"
00:01:56,00:01:57,you could get sent for.
00:01:57,00:01:58,- There was a murderers.
00:01:58,00:01:59,"- I made up the urinating on the streets one,"
00:01:59,00:02:01,but I imagine that might have been a thing.
00:02:01,00:02:02,- So you could get sent there for recommending
00:02:02,00:02:04,that politicians get paid?
00:02:04,00:02:07,"- No, no, what?"
00:02:07,00:02:10,"- You could get sent there for stealing fish,"
00:02:10,00:02:12,for starting a union.
00:02:12,00:02:15,"There was, in 1843, a guy called James Prido"
00:02:15,00:02:18,was transported for bestiality with a donkey.
00:02:18,00:02:21,"And in 1850, Lieutenant Robert Gates"
00:02:21,00:02:24,was sent to Australia for striking Queen Victoria
00:02:24,00:02:25,with a cane.
00:02:25,00:02:27,- Wow.
00:02:27,00:02:31,"I agree with that one, do you?"
00:02:31,00:02:33,"- With him doing it, with him being sent away."
00:02:33,00:02:35,"- With him being sent to Australia, right?"
00:02:35,00:02:37,"- Okay, actually, there were quite a lot of bestialities."
00:02:37,00:02:39,"There's a list. - Sorry, can I just clarify?"
00:02:39,00:02:40,I was not talking about the bestiality one.
00:02:40,00:02:42,I was talking about--
00:02:42,00:02:43,"- You don't need to feel bad about it, Andy, okay?"
00:02:43,00:02:44,- I don't feel bad about it.
00:02:44,00:02:45,There's nothing to feel bad about.
00:02:45,00:02:51,"- Okay, no, the Australian government actually has a list"
00:02:51,00:02:53,of all the crimes that people were transported for.
00:02:53,00:02:55,So I was reading through this list
00:02:55,00:02:57,"and there are 13 for bestiality,"
00:02:57,00:02:59,but there are some that are really weird.
00:02:59,00:03:01,So one is bad notes.
00:03:01,00:03:02,What does that mean? - Bad notes.
00:03:02,00:03:04,- Oh. - 27 people for bad notes.
00:03:04,00:03:05,- Counterfeiting money?
00:03:05,00:03:06,"- Yeah, I guess so."
00:03:06,00:03:08,"- There was, counterfeiting was a separate one, weirdly."
00:03:08,00:03:09,I also learned a new word.
00:03:09,00:03:13,"It said that about 40 people were done for hammer sucking,"
00:03:13,00:03:14,which I've never heard of.
00:03:14,00:03:16,- Hammer sucking? - Hammer sucking.
00:03:16,00:03:16,- Yeah.
00:03:16,00:03:18,Do you guys know that word?
00:03:18,00:03:19,- No.
00:03:19,00:03:20,- So I think this must have just gone out of use.
00:03:20,00:03:21,It means to break into someone's house
00:03:21,00:03:23,and assault them with the intention of assaulting them.
00:03:23,00:03:27,- And it's different to-- - Assault them with the intention
00:03:27,00:03:28,of assaulting them.
00:03:28,00:03:29,- Sorry.
00:03:29,00:03:31,To break into someone's house with the intention
00:03:31,00:03:34,of assaulting someone and then assault them.
00:03:34,00:03:37,"As opposed to stew-threaf, which people were also sent for."
00:03:37,00:03:38,- What? - Yeah.
00:03:38,00:03:39,Stew-threaf.
00:03:39,00:03:41,These are just words that I'd never heard.
00:03:41,00:03:42,- Do we know what that is?
00:03:42,00:03:43,"- Yeah, that's breaking into someone's house"
00:03:43,00:03:45,"without the intention of assaulting someone,"
00:03:45,00:03:47,but someone pops up so you have to assault them anyway.
00:03:47,00:03:50,(audience laughing)
00:03:50,00:03:51,"- Oh, it's really hard to prove"
00:03:51,00:03:54,"when we were in the house, when you were hammer sucking"
00:03:54,00:03:56,or stew-threaf and-- - In a way you need the victim
00:03:56,00:03:59,"to go, it was my fault really for popping up."
00:03:59,00:04:02,(audience laughing)
00:04:02,00:04:03,- That's some very specific ones though.
00:04:03,00:04:07,"So it really goes down to detail, especially with theft."
00:04:07,00:04:09,"There was theft of a hairbrush, one person,"
00:04:09,00:04:11,got sent to Australia for that.
00:04:11,00:04:14,"Theft of six chickens, 17 people."
00:04:14,00:04:17,17 separate people stole six chickens.
00:04:17,00:04:20,"Theft of bacon, the theft of shovels."
00:04:20,00:04:22,"People are stealing left, right, and center."
00:04:22,00:04:24,"And yeah, they were all getting sent away."
00:04:24,00:04:26,- So one thing that happened when you boarded
00:04:26,00:04:29,the transport ships was you got given a bag of cloth
00:04:29,00:04:30,if you were a woman.
00:04:30,00:04:33,"So Elizabeth Frye, who's the social reformer,"
00:04:33,00:04:36,she's on bank notes now.
00:04:36,00:04:36,She's on the five pound note.
00:04:36,00:04:38,She on the current five pound note?
00:04:38,00:04:40,Think she is. - Anyone?
00:04:40,00:04:41,"- No. - No, all right."
00:04:41,00:04:42,- Not according to that one man
00:04:42,00:04:44,"who I'm gonna trust, completely."
00:04:44,00:04:46,(audience laughing)
00:04:46,00:04:48,- Someone check a five pound note.
00:04:48,00:04:49,Surely someone has a five pound note.
00:04:49,00:04:51,- She definitely has been on the five pound note.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"But anyway, she had this kind of social program going,"
00:04:54,00:04:57,"which was if you're a woman being transported to Australia,"
00:04:57,00:05:00,"as you boarded she or her representatives,"
00:05:00,00:05:02,would give you a bag and it contained lots of scraps
00:05:02,00:05:04,of cloth and needles and thread.
00:05:04,00:05:06,And the idea was that you could make a quilt
00:05:06,00:05:09,on your way over and then sell it when you got there
00:05:09,00:05:12,to give yourself a tiny financial start.
00:05:12,00:05:14,- But everyone else has also got a quilt
00:05:14,00:05:16,'cause they've also been on the boat.
00:05:16,00:05:18,"- You wanna really diversify, don't you?"
00:05:18,00:05:19,- You're just quilt swapping.
00:05:19,00:05:21,Is it entire society of quilt swapping?
00:05:21,00:05:23,(laughing)
00:05:23,00:05:24,- Which was a separate offense.
00:05:24,00:05:26,You could be sent to Australia for actually.
00:05:26,00:05:29,"- One thing I really love about that is,"
00:05:29,00:05:32,so you were badly behaved in Britain
00:05:32,00:05:34,and you got sent to Australia.
00:05:34,00:05:36,"But if you were badly behaved in Australia,"
00:05:36,00:05:39,then they'd send you even further to North of Ireland.
00:05:39,00:05:41,So you go to one more island.
00:05:41,00:05:42,And I wanna know what happens
00:05:42,00:05:44,if you're badly behaved in North of Ireland?
00:05:44,00:05:45,What happens then?
00:05:45,00:05:46,Back to Britain.
00:05:46,00:05:47,(laughing)
00:05:47,00:05:48,- Going around and around.
00:05:48,00:05:50,"Yeah, Northern Ireland was very bad, wasn't it?"
00:05:50,00:05:51,"- Yeah, it was horrible."
00:05:51,00:05:52,"- In fact, I think people used to"
00:05:52,00:05:54,on North of Ireland try and commit other crimes
00:05:54,00:05:56,'cause what you would get is a death penalty.
00:05:56,00:05:58,"And for that, you get sent back to Australia"
00:05:58,00:05:59,and you'd be on death row
00:05:59,00:06:00,and they thought that's way better
00:06:00,00:06:02,"than this terrible North of Ireland, please."
00:06:02,00:06:03,- Wow.
00:06:03,00:06:05,- I've heard of the Cascade's female factory.
00:06:05,00:06:06,- No.
00:06:06,00:06:08,"- So this was somewhere where again, it was,"
00:06:08,00:06:11,"so I think most of the people who were transportable men,"
00:06:11,00:06:12,it was maybe 80%.
00:06:12,00:06:14,But the Cascade's female factory
00:06:14,00:06:17,was a kind of workhouse for female convicts
00:06:17,00:06:18,when they were sent over.
00:06:18,00:06:21,It was a kind of distillery slash prison.
00:06:21,00:06:22,"And when they were in there,"
00:06:22,00:06:24,"they weren't allowed to speak to men, these women."
00:06:24,00:06:26,But they did devise a scheme
00:06:26,00:06:28,where they bribed a corrupt water.
00:06:28,00:06:31,"And I swear to God, this is what the source I have says."
00:06:31,00:06:33,"It says, they smuggled love letters"
00:06:33,00:06:37,to the men they wanted to communicate with inside chickens.
00:06:37,00:06:39,(laughing)
00:06:39,00:06:41,"- No, we know why they were stealing all those chickens."
00:06:41,00:06:43,(laughing)
00:06:43,00:06:45,- They smuggled love letters inside chickens.
00:06:45,00:06:46,- Yeah.
00:06:46,00:06:48,- They were living chickens or dead chickens.
00:06:48,00:06:50,- Or were inside.
00:06:50,00:06:53,- I think it goes in the bit where the egg comes out.
00:06:53,00:06:56,"- Okay, not through the beak or under the wing."
00:06:56,00:06:58,(laughing)
00:06:58,00:06:59,- That's what I do.
00:06:59,00:07:00,"- These guys in this factory,"
00:07:00,00:07:04,they famously protested in 1832.
00:07:04,00:07:05,And the way that they did that
00:07:05,00:07:07,"is the governor of Van Diemensland,"
00:07:07,00:07:09,"which is now Tasmania, came along."
00:07:09,00:07:12,"And turning right around, and at one impulse,"
00:07:12,00:07:15,"they pulled up their clothes, showing the naked posterias,"
00:07:15,00:07:18,"which they simultaneously smacked with their hands,"
00:07:18,00:07:21,making a loud and not very musical noise.
00:07:21,00:07:24,(laughing)
00:07:24,00:07:25,"And on another occasion,"
00:07:25,00:07:29,"some dozen or 20 women seized the governor,"
00:07:29,00:07:32,took off his trousers and deliberately endeavoured
00:07:32,00:07:34,to deprive him of his manhood.
00:07:34,00:07:35,- Wow.
00:07:35,00:07:38,- It's not what you want.
00:07:38,00:07:40,"- Now what happened to the chickens doesn't sound so bad,"
00:07:40,00:07:41,doesn't it?
00:07:41,00:07:42,(laughing)
00:07:42,00:07:45,- People always think that I think the people
00:07:45,00:07:46,"that were sent over to Australia, though,"
00:07:46,00:07:49,"were kind of from the lowest of the low in society,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,like the really lower class working classes.
00:07:51,00:07:53,"But it was a whole range of people,"
00:07:53,00:07:56,it was basically anyone unwanted in Britain.
00:07:56,00:07:59,"So there was really a good article by Thomas Cannelli,"
00:07:59,00:08:01,"you know, the Australian author,"
00:08:01,00:08:03,who was describing the kind of people that would go.
00:08:03,00:08:04,And he was thinking there was a lot of members
00:08:04,00:08:06,"of the gentry in the bourgeoisie,"
00:08:06,00:08:09,but people who sort of had gambling debts
00:08:09,00:08:10,"or who'd got themselves into trouble,"
00:08:10,00:08:13,or he said bluff English lads who weren't particularly good
00:08:13,00:08:16,academically or who had impregnated the maid.
00:08:16,00:08:18,And then you've got to go.
00:08:18,00:08:21,"But do you know, just because, so Ned Kelly"
00:08:21,00:08:23,is obviously relevant to this.
00:08:23,00:08:24,So this police force was created
00:08:24,00:08:26,and the police became quite corrupt and hated.
00:08:26,00:08:28,And then you got these rebels in Australia
00:08:28,00:08:30,who were kind of hero villains.
00:08:30,00:08:32,And Ned Kelly is the main one.
00:08:32,00:08:35,But I didn't know that the world's first feature length film
00:08:35,00:08:37,was the Kelly Gang.
00:08:37,00:08:38,So it was the story of the Kelly Gang.
00:08:38,00:08:43,"It was made in 1906, and it was banned almost immediately,"
00:08:43,00:08:44,because it was shown in Australia in cinemas.
00:08:44,00:08:45,It was super successful.
00:08:45,00:08:48,And then people started committing kind of imitation crimes.
00:08:48,00:08:52,"So a bunch of kids went and held up a photography warehouse,"
00:08:52,00:08:55,"I think, and stole a bunch of stuff from it"
00:08:55,00:08:57,and held up some schoolchildren at gunpoint.
00:08:57,00:08:58,And what?
00:08:58,00:08:59,They canceled.
00:08:59,00:09:00,So everyone was fine.
00:09:00,00:09:02,"So yeah, they canceled it."
00:09:02,00:09:03,But it was really successful.
00:09:03,00:09:06,And the reviewers got kind of annoyed about it
00:09:06,00:09:09,because the way they did films in those days was people
00:09:09,00:09:11,went to the cinema and they showed the film.
00:09:11,00:09:13,And they also had a lecturer standing by the side
00:09:13,00:09:15,"of it explaining the action as it happened,"
00:09:15,00:09:16,because obviously no sound.
00:09:16,00:09:19,And then they had actors behind the screen
00:09:19,00:09:21,who were giving it the dialogue.
00:09:21,00:09:21,So--
00:09:21,00:09:22,Wow.
00:09:22,00:09:25,--and apparently the Kelly dialogue and sound effects
00:09:25,00:09:27,were so loud that it really upset people
00:09:27,00:09:29,who were used to quiet silent films.
00:09:29,00:09:31,"So there was something called the Kelly Belogruf,"
00:09:31,00:09:32,"which reviewers referred to, which"
00:09:32,00:09:35,was going to the cinema to see the Ned Kelly film.
00:09:35,00:09:38,"And you just, like, be deffined by these thunder claps"
00:09:38,00:09:40,that they were doing behind the screen.
00:09:40,00:09:42,I love the idea of a lecturer.
00:09:42,00:09:45,"Just by the side, who's just filling you in on,"
00:09:45,00:09:48,"who everyone is, every scene."
00:09:48,00:09:50,"For any Marvel superhero film, I would like that."
00:09:50,00:09:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:52,00:09:55,Just why are we all trying to get the rocks?
00:09:55,00:09:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:59,00:10:01,Just speaking of famous Australian convicts
00:10:01,00:10:02,from that period.
00:10:02,00:10:06,"So Ned Kelly, more an outlaw than a convict initially."
00:10:06,00:10:08,There was a guy called Moon Dine Joe.
00:10:08,00:10:10,Moon Dine was the place he was from.
00:10:10,00:10:14,"And this guy, he'd arrived with the boats."
00:10:14,00:10:15,I don't think it was the very first fleet.
00:10:15,00:10:18,But he kind of served his sentence there.
00:10:18,00:10:19,And he was let free.
00:10:19,00:10:22,And he-- so they must have sorted out that system that--
00:10:22,00:10:24,"oh, so they had a problem with earlier."
00:10:24,00:10:27,And he started doing things like branding cows for himself
00:10:27,00:10:28,and keeping them.
00:10:28,00:10:30,So he got arrested and put back in prison.
00:10:30,00:10:31,But he escaped.
00:10:31,00:10:33,So then he got arrested again and put back in prison.
00:10:33,00:10:34,And then he escaped.
00:10:34,00:10:35,And then he got arrested again.
00:10:35,00:10:36,And he just kept escaping.
00:10:36,00:10:38,And there was nothing that they could do.
00:10:38,00:10:41,"So they eventually had to build him his own custom cell,"
00:10:41,00:10:42,just completely on their own.
00:10:42,00:10:45,"And they said to him that if he escaped that,"
00:10:45,00:10:46,all would be forgiven.
00:10:46,00:10:47,"He's like, you go free."
00:10:47,00:10:49,We don't know what to do with you if you were escaped.
00:10:49,00:10:50,Wow.
00:10:50,00:10:50,Did he escape?
00:10:50,00:10:51,You're not going to believe this.
00:10:51,00:10:52,I forgot to write down the answers to that.
00:10:52,00:10:54,"Oh, my God."
00:10:54,00:10:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:55,00:10:58,When in that story did you realize that you didn't have the answer?
00:10:58,00:10:59,"You knew when I was going, and then he escaped."
00:10:59,00:11:01,And then he was in that moment.
00:11:01,00:11:03,I think I saw it in a few more escapes.
00:11:03,00:11:06,So this is where my lecturer system will be able to sweep it
00:11:06,00:11:09,and say he did not escape.
00:11:09,00:11:10,I looked up modern Aussie police.
00:11:10,00:11:11,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:11,00:11:13,It might be interesting to see what they're up to.
00:11:13,00:11:17,So there's a town in Queensland called Birdsville.
00:11:17,00:11:19,And it's amazing.
00:11:19,00:11:21,So it has one police officer.
00:11:21,00:11:23,And it's Birdsville and the surrounding region.
00:11:23,00:11:27,And his jurisdiction is the same size as the United Kingdom.
00:11:27,00:11:28,Wow.
00:11:28,00:11:31,"It's 93,000 square miles."
00:11:31,00:11:32,Wow.
00:11:32,00:11:33,What does he do?
00:11:33,00:11:33,He drives around.
00:11:33,00:11:34,He drives a lot.
00:11:34,00:11:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:37,00:11:39,"A lot of mileage expenses, yeah."
00:11:39,00:11:41,So because it's a tiny town.
00:11:41,00:11:46,It says the population signs say the population is 115
00:11:46,00:11:47,"plus or minus 7,000."
00:11:47,00:11:49,"Because there's a horse race in September,"
00:11:49,00:11:51,which brings a lot of tourists.
00:11:51,00:11:55,"So almost all year it's 115, and then September is 7,000."
00:11:55,00:11:57,"And Buzzfeed wrote this huge long piece all about him,"
00:11:57,00:11:58,and they interviewed him.
00:11:58,00:12:01,And the piece says about Birdsville.
00:12:01,00:12:03,"If you want to buy a coffee, you have one option,"
00:12:03,00:12:04,the Birdsville Bakery.
00:12:04,00:12:05,"If you want to visit a restaurant,"
00:12:05,00:12:07,"you have one option, the Birdsville Hotel."
00:12:07,00:12:09,"If you want to see a film or live music,"
00:12:09,00:12:10,you are in the wrong town.
00:12:10,00:12:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:14,00:12:16,"Well, he's not getting re-employed by the tourist"
00:12:16,00:12:16,department for Birdsville.
00:12:16,00:12:18,What are you saying?
00:12:18,00:12:20,"As I was Googling all this stuff and Googling Australia,"
00:12:20,00:12:22,"I found something that I just want to share,"
00:12:22,00:12:25,even though it's not really on topic.
00:12:25,00:12:28,And it was a new story that a 21-year-old Australian
00:12:28,00:12:31,"has been labelled the unluckiest man in Australia,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,after he was bitten by a spider on the penis
00:12:33,00:12:35,for the second time in five months.
00:12:35,00:12:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:38,00:12:40,It was his first visit to a portable toilet
00:12:40,00:12:42,since his last encounter with a spider.
00:12:42,00:12:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:47,00:12:48,It was the same spider.
00:12:48,00:12:49,It saw him coming in as well.
00:12:49,00:12:51,I'm going to get you again.
00:12:51,00:12:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:54,00:12:55,"Oh, my God."
00:12:55,00:12:56,"Oh, my God."
00:12:56,00:12:58,"His family, honestly, it'll be fine."
00:12:58,00:13:01,It's a $1 billion chance.
00:13:01,00:13:03,"Oh, the worst thing, I mean, this is so sad."
00:13:03,00:13:05,"But he went to the hospital, and all the nurses"
00:13:05,00:13:06,remembered him from the last time.
00:13:06,00:13:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:09,00:13:12,Should we move on to what you think is just what
00:13:12,00:13:13,the Aussie police these days have to deal with.
00:13:13,00:13:16,I just looked up recent Australian crimes.
00:13:16,00:13:21,And there was one who was a man who was a drunk driver
00:13:21,00:13:23,who started driving laps around the car park
00:13:23,00:13:25,of a Sydney branch of McDonald's after they
00:13:25,00:13:32,refused to sell him 200 chicken nuggets at 5 a.m. on Remembrance Day.
00:13:32,00:13:34,"He started screaming, I want my effing nuggets."
00:13:34,00:13:36,I'm going to eff you up.
00:13:36,00:13:38,He drove around a load of laps before changing his mind
00:13:38,00:13:40,and asking for 200 hash browns in stakes.
00:13:40,00:13:45,It was breakfast time.
00:13:45,00:13:48,"Police were called, but before they made a sure rest"
00:13:48,00:13:49,"in, the perpetrator had demanded a refund,"
00:13:49,00:13:51,but was unable to remember what he had ordered
00:13:51,00:13:53,and wanted a refund for.
00:13:53,00:13:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:56,00:13:58,"Not for nothing, did those brave men and women"
00:13:58,00:14:01,sacrifice themselves?
00:14:01,00:14:05,"Anyway, we hope to be touring Australia again next year."
00:14:05,00:14:09,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinsky."
00:14:09,00:14:12,"My fact this week is that in the first newspaper crosswords,"
00:14:12,00:14:16,the answers did not have to be actual words.
00:14:16,00:14:20,So this is just this so weird thing.
00:14:20,00:14:22,I was reading the telegraph released a book of the history
00:14:22,00:14:26,"of its own crosswords, and it talks about their first crosswords,"
00:14:26,00:14:28,which was in 1925.
00:14:28,00:14:31,And I think that was pretty much the earliest newspaper crosswords
00:14:31,00:14:34,in the UK was in 1925.
00:14:34,00:14:38,"And you would have clues like, I don't know how much, if one"
00:14:38,00:14:40,"knows about cryptic crosswords, I assume everything."
00:14:40,00:14:43,"Stop it, everyone."
00:14:43,00:14:45,"If you've gone an anagram in a cryptic crossword,"
00:14:45,00:14:48,"you'll have a word like muddle or mix up, which"
00:14:48,00:14:49,shows you it's an anagram.
00:14:49,00:14:51,And then you know you've got to mix up the letters.
00:14:51,00:14:53,"But in one of these early crosswords,"
00:14:53,00:14:56,the clue was just a muddled life.
00:14:56,00:15:01,"And the answer was ilf-ilf-e, not a real word, or--"
00:15:01,00:15:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:04,00:15:06,"You want to show me its file, and you've just got it wrong."
00:15:06,00:15:07,It's ilf.
00:15:07,00:15:09,It's ilf otherwise it didn't work.
00:15:09,00:15:13,"Another one I liked, and this really is for the cryptic fans,"
00:15:13,00:15:14,"so apologies, everyone else."
00:15:14,00:15:18,But this has its tail dislocated.
00:15:18,00:15:21,"It means you take the word this, and you take the tail of it,"
00:15:21,00:15:24,"which is the end, which is the s, and you just"
00:15:24,00:15:26,"the case it, and put it on the front."
00:15:26,00:15:28,So the answer was c-thee.
00:15:28,00:15:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:32,00:15:34,But there was a moral panic about crosswords
00:15:34,00:15:38,when they were first really popular.
00:15:38,00:15:42,"So the first modern crossword was in a New York world,"
00:15:42,00:15:43,which was a magazine in 1913.
00:15:43,00:15:46,"But in the '20s, they became really popular."
00:15:46,00:15:50,"And in 1924, the New York Times said that they were a sinful waste."
00:15:50,00:15:54,And they said that the utterly futile finding of words
00:15:54,00:15:56,was a primitive sort of mental exercise.
00:15:56,00:15:58,"But they added, fortunately, the question"
00:15:58,00:16:00,of whether the puzzles are beneficial or harmful
00:16:00,00:16:02,is in no urgent need of an answer.
00:16:02,00:16:04,The craze is evidently dying out fast.
00:16:04,00:16:08,"In a few months, it will be forgotten."
00:16:08,00:16:10,They also had the libraries of New York
00:16:10,00:16:13,complained that people doing crosswords were ruining
00:16:13,00:16:16,libraries because they were coming in and dominating
00:16:16,00:16:19,all the dictionaries when people who actually wanted
00:16:19,00:16:22,to use dictionaries were not able to get there to use them.
00:16:22,00:16:26,So they released a statement saying that the puzzle fans
00:16:26,00:16:28,swarmed to the dictionaries and encyclopedias.
00:16:28,00:16:30,So as to driveway readers and students
00:16:30,00:16:32,"who need these books and they're daily work,"
00:16:32,00:16:35,can there be any doubt that the library's duty to protect
00:16:35,00:16:36,its legitimate readers?
00:16:36,00:16:39,"And it was basically-- yeah, this is the death of libraries,"
00:16:39,00:16:40,because these crosswords--
00:16:40,00:16:44,"As we've just learned, a dictionary is useless to you,"
00:16:44,00:16:46,"filling out old crosswords, so what are they doing?"
00:16:46,00:16:49,There was a psychologist from Columbia University
00:16:49,00:16:51,who said that crossword puzzles-- and this
00:16:51,00:16:53,was around the same time-- he said the reason they're so
00:16:53,00:16:57,popular is that crossword puzzles satisfied the 45
00:16:57,00:17:00,fundamental desires of the human species.
00:17:00,00:17:03,Not all 45.
00:17:03,00:17:06,"Well, I looked at a longer list of fundamental desires"
00:17:06,00:17:09,"I could find, and it included curiosity, which, I think,"
00:17:09,00:17:12,"is fair, order, like point things in order about works,"
00:17:12,00:17:19,"physical activity, kind of, maybe, romance, no romance."
00:17:19,00:17:21,I've not in any crossword I've completed.
00:17:21,00:17:25,"No, vengeance."
00:17:25,00:17:28,"Actually, yes, vengeance, as we can see, yeah."
00:17:28,00:17:29,I think you're doing it wrong.
00:17:29,00:17:32,"And definitely doing it wrong, eating."
00:17:32,00:17:33,That's what you do at the end.
00:17:33,00:17:37,That's why they're always on rice paper.
00:17:37,00:17:39,There was apparently people started writing into zoos
00:17:39,00:17:42,"and demanding of the zookeepers to know a three-letter word,"
00:17:42,00:17:44,"which meant a female swan, and things like that."
00:17:44,00:17:45,"Yeah, because back in the day, I guess"
00:17:45,00:17:48,there was no internet to just sort of when you've given up.
00:17:48,00:17:49,Exactly.
00:17:49,00:17:50,You just had to write to a zookeeper.
00:17:50,00:17:51,Yeah.
00:17:51,00:17:53,That reminds me.
00:17:53,00:17:54,And there was no internet as well.
00:17:54,00:17:55,And there was a new story.
00:17:55,00:17:57,Maybe one of you guys found it.
00:17:57,00:17:58,"I haven't written it down, but it was--"
00:17:58,00:18:01,"there was a guy in the UK somewhere,"
00:18:01,00:18:02,and he was doing a crossword.
00:18:02,00:18:04,"He was about 80 years old, but he had the internet."
00:18:04,00:18:06,It was about five or 10 years ago.
00:18:06,00:18:10,"And the question was, Asian Ass."
00:18:10,00:18:13,And he decided to look it up on the internet.
00:18:13,00:18:16,"Oh, no."
00:18:16,00:18:20,"And he said, basically, he didn't know this kind of thing existed."
00:18:20,00:18:22,Although it does rather sound like his wife came down
00:18:22,00:18:24,"and said, what are you looking at?"
00:18:24,00:18:25,Yeah.
00:18:25,00:18:27,"Apparently going through 1,000 crosswords"
00:18:27,00:18:33,to find any clue which might explain it.
00:18:33,00:18:35,I found a crossword that I really like.
00:18:35,00:18:39,"It's an art piece, which has been displayed in art galleries."
00:18:39,00:18:42,And it was lent to Nuremberg's Newers Museum.
00:18:42,00:18:43,And it was up there.
00:18:43,00:18:49,And a 90-year-old woman went to see it and filled it in.
00:18:49,00:18:51,"And it was worth 68,000 pounds."
00:18:51,00:18:53,And it is surely worth more when it's completed.
00:18:53,00:18:56,"Well, her argument is it's fine."
00:18:56,00:18:58,"In that case, I've got some crossword books to sell you."
00:18:58,00:19:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:03,00:19:07,"This one's worth a fortune, and it's completely completed."
00:19:07,00:19:08,It's a pretty good point.
00:19:08,00:19:09,"Yeah, no."
00:19:09,00:19:11,She only got a couple in before someone noticed
00:19:11,00:19:13,that she was writing on a bit of art on the wall.
00:19:13,00:19:16,"And so, yeah, so she got in trouble."
00:19:16,00:19:20,They raised out her contribution to it.
00:19:20,00:19:22,But she has claimed that she now holds copyright
00:19:22,00:19:23,because it's a new work.
00:19:23,00:19:25,She's now a collaborator.
00:19:25,00:19:26,Right.
00:19:26,00:19:27,We'll fill through all Avengers.
00:19:27,00:19:28,"You're right, yeah."
00:19:28,00:19:32,I like-- so crossword setters are always kind of heroes.
00:19:32,00:19:35,But one of the first ones was Arthur Winn.
00:19:35,00:19:38,I think he was the first one who set the New York World One.
00:19:38,00:19:42,And the first crossword puzzle he set to try and convince
00:19:42,00:19:44,his publishers-- this is the thing worth doing--
00:19:44,00:19:45,the new type of publishers.
00:19:45,00:19:48,He-- the word dove appeared twice.
00:19:48,00:19:49,So it's the first ever crossword.
00:19:49,00:19:52,"You've got the entire dictionary and non-dictionary,"
00:19:52,00:19:54,"apparently, at your disposal."
00:19:54,00:19:57,And he couldn't think of something that wasn't dove
00:19:57,00:19:58,for that second clue.
00:19:58,00:20:00,"One was at the same clue, or--"
00:20:00,00:20:03,"No, one clue was bird, and one was pigeon."
00:20:03,00:20:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:06,00:20:08,"Yep, couldn't-- and then the other words were just bizarre."
00:20:08,00:20:11,"It had the word nafe, female surf."
00:20:11,00:20:14,And then it also had doff as in Homer Simpson.
00:20:14,00:20:15,"Don't know, right?"
00:20:15,00:20:15,Yeah.
00:20:15,00:20:16,Wow.
00:20:16,00:20:17,It was the original dove.
00:20:17,00:20:19,What was the clue?
00:20:19,00:20:21,It was Homer Simpson's catchphrase.
00:20:21,00:20:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:23,00:20:27,Wow.
00:20:27,00:20:29,"How do they work, they back in the day?"
00:20:29,00:20:31,And he-- do you know what he published it as?
00:20:31,00:20:33,It wasn't called a crossword.
00:20:33,00:20:36,"Oh, it was called-- it was called a word cross."
00:20:36,00:20:37,"Yeah, that was the original."
00:20:37,00:20:40,"At some point down the line, we went better the other way, man."
00:20:40,00:20:40,"No, it wasn't that."
00:20:40,00:20:42,It was a few weeks later.
00:20:42,00:20:44,It was a mess up in the type setting.
00:20:44,00:20:45,Really?
00:20:45,00:20:46,Switched it round to crossword as a guy way.
00:20:46,00:20:47,And the guy way.
00:20:47,00:20:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:50,00:20:56,"Actually, just on that weird words, there was a guy called--"
00:20:56,00:21:00,"an editor called Arthur Maurice, who noticed that the words"
00:21:00,00:21:03,that Americans were using in the late 1920s
00:21:03,00:21:05,were a lot shorter and had more vowels in them
00:21:05,00:21:07,than they were before that.
00:21:07,00:21:10,And he put it down to the crossword craze.
00:21:10,00:21:12,"Basically, he's saying, if you're writing crosswords,"
00:21:12,00:21:14,"you need lots of these small words, like Doha or whatever."
00:21:14,00:21:16,"And actually, he noticed that more people"
00:21:16,00:21:18,"are using words such as a bet, acute, adept,"
00:21:18,00:21:20,"eek, elan, eon, things like that."
00:21:20,00:21:21,Right.
00:21:21,00:21:23,So it actually changed the way that people speak.
00:21:23,00:21:24,What were the four people saying?
00:21:24,00:21:27,"Oh, Zephyr and Oh, Rhythm."
00:21:27,00:21:30,"And I kind of think of a single other word, which is--"
00:21:30,00:21:32,"That would only be ""Constance."""
00:21:32,00:21:34,"It's just like, pal, crystal palace."
00:21:34,00:21:35,"Yeah, crystal palace."
00:21:35,00:21:36,Crystal.
00:21:36,00:21:38,I still can't believe they're the longest words
00:21:38,00:21:40,that your two collective minds can come up with.
00:21:40,00:21:41,Consonance.
00:21:41,00:21:42,Just loads of consonants.
00:21:42,00:21:44,Could a consonant have been heavy?
00:21:44,00:21:46,"Please, the floor of the walls."
00:21:46,00:21:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:49,00:21:50,"Latch, don't."
00:21:50,00:21:52,Don't help her with crosswords at the moment.
00:21:52,00:21:54,You're not allowed to use crosswords at the moment.
00:21:54,00:21:55,It's drink-neen.
00:21:55,00:21:55,"Right, surely."
00:21:55,00:21:57,[INTERPOSING VOICES]
00:21:57,00:21:58,You're right.
00:21:58,00:22:01,"Lots of setters have their own characteristics,"
00:22:01,00:22:04,and they all have their own not-powers.
00:22:04,00:22:06,But their own ideas are really--
00:22:06,00:22:09,"I really don't understand the Marvel movies, do you?"
00:22:09,00:22:12,I thought it was so little crossword action in the later one.
00:22:12,00:22:14,I'm tempted not to go back.
00:22:14,00:22:17,There are a few than a hundred professional crossword
00:22:17,00:22:19,"setters in the UK, for me three reasons."
00:22:19,00:22:21,It's quite a niche thing to be doing.
00:22:21,00:22:24,But there is one setter called Mark Bremen.
00:22:24,00:22:26,"And this year, he launched what he said"
00:22:26,00:22:28,was the hardest in the world.
00:22:28,00:22:31,He estimated that it would take two years to complete.
00:22:31,00:22:34,"He said, I'm not saying that this crossword cannot be completed,"
00:22:34,00:22:35,"because, of course, it can."
00:22:35,00:22:37,"But nonetheless, it is finitially tough"
00:22:37,00:22:39,and significantly harder than anything
00:22:39,00:22:41,I've ever compiled before.
00:22:41,00:22:43,Based on the feedback of other compilers who have seen it
00:22:43,00:22:46,"or tried it, mine is about 100 times harder."
00:22:46,00:22:47,"If that description is indeed correct,"
00:22:47,00:22:49,then it stands to reason that it would
00:22:49,00:22:52,take the average enthusiast a hundred times longer to solve it.
00:22:52,00:22:55,This amounts to 100 weeks or just over two years.
00:22:55,00:22:57,It was solved within two hours.
00:22:57,00:23:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:00,00:23:02,He hadn't even finished that speech.
00:23:02,00:23:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:04,00:23:06,"To be honest, I lost faith in him when he said,"
00:23:06,00:23:08,it amounts to 100 weeks or just over two years.
00:23:08,00:23:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:11,00:23:14,That's when he knows he's got some miscalculations going on.
00:23:14,00:23:17,"The guy he solved it said, some of the clues were definitely"
00:23:17,00:23:20,"tricky, but two years would be a stretch."
00:23:20,00:23:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:21,00:23:24,"Just on the question setters, the New York Times"
00:23:24,00:23:26,had quite a fun run last year of a whole year
00:23:26,00:23:29,of celebrity question setters.
00:23:29,00:23:32,So Bill Clinton wrote a crossword for them.
00:23:32,00:23:35,"And my favorite one, Weird Al Yankovich wrote one."
00:23:35,00:23:38,"If you guys remember Weird Al Yankovich, he wrote one."
00:23:38,00:23:43,So his was mainly filled with cheese-based puns.
00:23:43,00:23:48,"So he, like, answers that were allowed with fetter attraction"
00:23:48,00:23:50,and a few good men.
00:23:50,00:23:50,Yeah.
00:23:50,00:23:52,"But interestingly, they set rules to it."
00:23:52,00:23:55,So he was disqualified when he tried to get a clue
00:23:55,00:23:57,"in where the answer was, fondue the right thing."
00:23:57,00:23:59,"And they said, we have strict cheeses"
00:23:59,00:24:01,that you're allowed to use in this crossword.
00:24:01,00:24:03,And fondue is not a cheese.
00:24:03,00:24:04,It's a style.
00:24:04,00:24:06,"So if you're doing a cheese crossword,"
00:24:06,00:24:09,you have to really stick within the cheese category.
00:24:09,00:24:11,"Yeah, it has to be just a cheese, I guess, within the word."
00:24:11,00:24:14,"Yogg, that's mostly consonants."
00:24:14,00:24:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:17,00:24:20,Didn't know you were still playing that game.
00:24:20,00:24:24,"I'm going to be playing it all the way home, eh?"
00:24:24,00:24:27,"It is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:24:27,00:24:29,"My fact is that in the German Renaissance,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,it was briefly fashionable for women
00:24:31,00:24:33,to have themselves painted as a biblical character halfway
00:24:33,00:24:36,through decapitating a man.
00:24:36,00:24:43,"So there's this biblical story, which is of Judith and Halophanes."
00:24:43,00:24:45,I think that's how it's pronounced.
00:24:45,00:24:48,"But he's dead, so it doesn't matter."
00:24:48,00:24:50,There's a biblical story of Judith and Halophanes.
00:24:50,00:24:54,And Halophanes is a very brutal general who
00:24:54,00:24:57,is about to destroy Judith's home city.
00:24:57,00:24:59,And he's outside the city.
00:24:59,00:25:02,"She is a widow, and he lets her into his tent"
00:25:02,00:25:04,"because he fancies her, basically."
00:25:04,00:25:07,"And she comes in, and she gets him drunk."
00:25:07,00:25:09,"He passes out, and she decapitates him."
00:25:09,00:25:13,And she takes the head away in a basket.
00:25:13,00:25:15,So she's quite a heroic figure.
00:25:15,00:25:19,"This is Old Testament stuff, obviously."
00:25:19,00:25:22,And there was an artist in the German Renaissance
00:25:22,00:25:24,"called Kranach, Lucas Kranach, the elder."
00:25:24,00:25:27,And he painted eight different versions of this scene.
00:25:27,00:25:28,So loads of artists have painted it.
00:25:28,00:25:30,Caravaggio did it.
00:25:30,00:25:32,Dozens and dozens of artists have painted it over the centuries.
00:25:32,00:25:35,But there are at least eight different tutors that he painted.
00:25:35,00:25:36,And they're all wearing modern dress.
00:25:36,00:25:39,And they've all got completely different looks.
00:25:39,00:25:41,And we now believe that several different women
00:25:41,00:25:44,in the Saxon court commissioned paintings of themselves
00:25:44,00:25:46,halfway through to capitating a man.
00:25:46,00:25:47,That's so cool.
00:25:47,00:25:49,"And we should clarify, when you say modern dress,"
00:25:49,00:25:50,you mean the modern dress of the time?
00:25:50,00:25:51,"No, no, no, no."
00:25:51,00:25:56,"I mean, they were in modern 21st century power business suits."
00:25:56,00:26:01,"That's-- it speaks to sort of a burgeoning angry feminism,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,"doesn't it, that women have suddenly gone,"
00:26:03,00:26:05,"God, I'm allowed to be painted to capitating somebody."
00:26:05,00:26:06,Brilliant.
00:26:06,00:26:10,"And this, just for anyone who thinks they don't recognize this"
00:26:10,00:26:13,"from the Bible, it's not in the Protestant version"
00:26:13,00:26:15,of the Old Testament that people use.
00:26:15,00:26:17,It is in the Catholic version.
00:26:17,00:26:18,And most people think that it's--
00:26:18,00:26:20,"I mean, what they think of the whole Bible, I don't know."
00:26:20,00:26:24,But everyone knows that this is non-historical.
00:26:24,00:26:27,"And some people have called it the first historical novel,"
00:26:27,00:26:28,"because it's so obviously not true,"
00:26:28,00:26:30,because there's a lot of anachronisms
00:26:30,00:26:32,"and, you know, nebuchadesses in here."
00:26:32,00:26:35,"Andachronisms, she's wearing a wrist watch at one point."
00:26:35,00:26:38,It doesn't stack up.
00:26:38,00:26:42,"A seven-four, seven flew over her, and this is implausible."
00:26:42,00:26:45,"Did you know, just speaking of a fashion in art,"
00:26:45,00:26:47,"a fashion in art for painting Mary Magdalene,"
00:26:47,00:26:49,covered in hair from head to toe?
00:26:49,00:26:50,No.
00:26:50,00:26:51,This is so weird.
00:26:51,00:26:52,"Well, like a big foot."
00:26:52,00:26:53,Yep.
00:26:53,00:26:55,She looks like a Yeti.
00:26:55,00:26:58,"And this is a trend in medieval art,"
00:26:58,00:27:00,"pictures of Mary Magdalene, a covered in hair."
00:27:00,00:27:04,And it's because she was sort of often referred
00:27:04,00:27:07,"to as having very long hair, and it sort of covered her"
00:27:07,00:27:09,genitals sometimes in art.
00:27:09,00:27:11,And it seemed to grow out of that in some versions
00:27:11,00:27:13,of the telling of her story.
00:27:13,00:27:16,"It was that after Jesus died, then she became a desert hermit"
00:27:16,00:27:18,and repentant of her prostitution and stuff.
00:27:18,00:27:21,"And she stopped caring about her parents at all,"
00:27:21,00:27:24,so all of her clothes fell off eventually.
00:27:24,00:27:27,And then a sort of a mercy god covered her in hair.
00:27:27,00:27:30,And there were these paintings of her all over medieval art.
00:27:30,00:27:31,And she looks like a Yeti.
00:27:31,00:27:32,I don't know.
00:27:32,00:27:34,"She's covered in hair, head to toe,"
00:27:34,00:27:37,but with a face of skin.
00:27:37,00:27:38,That's so weird.
00:27:38,00:27:41,"And also they used to paint Moses with horns, didn't they?"
00:27:41,00:27:43,They did.
00:27:43,00:27:47,And they reckon that that was maybe a mis-translation or something?
00:27:47,00:27:50,"Yeah, they thought it was a Bible mis-translation"
00:27:50,00:27:53,because it was describing him coming down the mountains.
00:27:53,00:27:56,And so they were doing it purely out of we think
00:27:56,00:27:57,that this is what was written.
00:27:57,00:28:01,"So there's a word that is Karen, like the name Karen."
00:28:01,00:28:03,And in Hebrew it can either mean horn or ray of light.
00:28:03,00:28:06,"So he came down with a ray of light in the Bible,"
00:28:06,00:28:08,"but some guy misread it and just went,"
00:28:08,00:28:10,"""I probably had horns."""
00:28:10,00:28:12,There is a painter called Daphne Todd.
00:28:12,00:28:14,And she is a modern portrait painter.
00:28:14,00:28:16,And she revealed a few years ago that she was commissioned
00:28:16,00:28:18,to paint someone who was extremely rude
00:28:18,00:28:20,and extremely uncooperative all the way
00:28:20,00:28:22,through the portrait painting process.
00:28:22,00:28:25,"And as a result, she has given that man a pair of horns"
00:28:25,00:28:29,in the painting and then painted over it with his hair.
00:28:29,00:28:33,"But in 50 or 100 years' time, it's going to be revealed"
00:28:33,00:28:35,that this guy has horns in the painting.
00:28:35,00:28:39,So other fashions from Renaissance time.
00:28:39,00:28:43,"The Chalping or Chalping, it was a platform shoe"
00:28:43,00:28:46,"that they wore, especially around Venice."
00:28:46,00:28:48,"And the idea was, you are it over your shoes"
00:28:48,00:28:50,because the ground was terrible.
00:28:50,00:28:52,"There was loads of poo around them, loads of mud and stuff like that."
00:28:52,00:28:53,You don't want it on your shoes.
00:28:53,00:28:54,You don't want it on your dress.
00:28:54,00:28:57,And so they got these nice high platforms.
00:28:57,00:28:59,"But then it kind of turned out that the higher you got,"
00:28:59,00:29:01,the better your status was.
00:29:01,00:29:04,And they got higher and higher and higher and higher.
00:29:04,00:29:07,"And eventually, they were getting examples"
00:29:07,00:29:11,that were over 20 inches high platform shoes in Venice.
00:29:11,00:29:14,"So just to put that into context, that would put Anna,"
00:29:14,00:29:18,"if you wore them, three inches taller than LeBron James,"
00:29:18,00:29:19,a basketball player.
00:29:19,00:29:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:22,00:29:26,But it is so hard to run up a basketball court in 20 years.
00:29:26,00:29:29,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:29:29,00:29:31,And that is James.
00:29:31,00:29:35,"OK, my fact this week is that mice can't hear their own footsteps."
00:29:35,00:29:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:38,00:29:40,"Now, is this because they are quite deaf,"
00:29:40,00:29:42,or because they walk very quietly?
00:29:42,00:29:44,It's because they're selectively deaf.
00:29:44,00:29:49,So there is a noise that happens when a mouse walks.
00:29:49,00:29:51,"And in theory, it could hear it."
00:29:51,00:29:53,"But its brain just goes, now I'm not going to listen to that."
00:29:53,00:29:54,And it just turns it off.
00:29:54,00:29:56,And it could be that this is true of actually all animals.
00:29:56,00:29:58,And maybe a few humans as well.
00:29:58,00:29:59,"Like if you walk down the street, you don't really"
00:29:59,00:30:01,notice your own footsteps.
00:30:01,00:30:04,But let's say you're walking on some gravel
00:30:04,00:30:06,"or some leaves or something, you might hear it."
00:30:06,00:30:08,And this is a new study that's recently
00:30:08,00:30:12,been done by Janani Sundarajan and Richard
00:30:12,00:30:14,Muni at Duke's School of Medicine.
00:30:14,00:30:17,And what they did was they put little buttons
00:30:17,00:30:21,on the bottom of a mouse's feet.
00:30:21,00:30:24,"And so as it went to long, it just made little--"
00:30:24,00:30:26,"beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
00:30:26,00:30:26,Wow.
00:30:26,00:30:27,It's like a little beeping noise.
00:30:27,00:30:31,"Like, you know that movie big when he's on the keyboard."
00:30:31,00:30:32,Isn't it like that?
00:30:32,00:30:34,But it was the same note every time.
00:30:34,00:30:36,And they checked the brain of the mouse.
00:30:36,00:30:38,And they realized that it could hear this--
00:30:38,00:30:39,it's reacting to this noise.
00:30:39,00:30:42,"But then as it went on after a week or two,"
00:30:42,00:30:43,it wasn't reacting to it anymore.
00:30:43,00:30:45,I bet the other mice were still reacting to it.
00:30:45,00:30:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:48,00:30:51,And what they found was is that basically the mice
00:30:51,00:30:54,had been trained to just not listen to the sound anymore.
00:30:54,00:30:56,And it's just natural in their brains.
00:30:56,00:30:59,"And the ones which had got used to this sound,"
00:30:59,00:31:03,they were much better than other mice at reacting to predators.
00:31:03,00:31:06,So if you had like a cat paw come in to get them.
00:31:06,00:31:08,The ones who couldn't hear their own footsteps
00:31:08,00:31:09,could get out of there.
00:31:09,00:31:11,But the ones who could hear them would pot off.
00:31:11,00:31:14,"They reckon that this maybe is why humans, possibly,"
00:31:14,00:31:17,"not the animals, can't hear your own footsteps."
00:31:17,00:31:17,Yeah.
00:31:17,00:31:20,I guess the human brain is very good at zoning stuff out
00:31:20,00:31:21,"that is for pieces, right?"
00:31:21,00:31:24,"Yeah, so if you're a heavy breather, for instance,"
00:31:24,00:31:26,you wouldn't necessarily know you were a heavy breather.
00:31:26,00:31:27,"Everyone else would know that you were doing it,"
00:31:27,00:31:28,but you wouldn't necessarily know what--
00:31:28,00:31:32,"I mean, the people you were phoning up would know, wouldn't they?"
00:31:32,00:31:34,"Yeah, I mean, like you would know if you were a heavy breather,"
00:31:34,00:31:35,wouldn't you?
00:31:35,00:31:36,And then you would know.
00:31:36,00:31:37,Yeah.
00:31:37,00:31:38,"Oh, what are you--"
00:31:38,00:31:41,"sorry, what are you saying?"
00:31:41,00:31:43,You were an extremely heavy breather.
00:31:43,00:31:44,That's not a heavy breather.
00:31:44,00:31:46,We don't need to go into it now.
00:31:46,00:31:48,"No, we're normal breather."
00:31:48,00:31:48,You're fired.
00:31:48,00:31:50,It's very distracting in the office.
00:31:50,00:31:58,"But yeah, I think that's it."
00:31:58,00:32:00,Can I just ask for the--
00:32:00,00:32:01,just to make sure I get this clear.
00:32:01,00:32:04,"So by cancelling out the noise, it means"
00:32:04,00:32:06,"that every other dangerous noise is amplified,"
00:32:06,00:32:08,and they don't cross fire with their own noise.
00:32:08,00:32:11,"Yeah, not amplified so much as you're just easier to hear"
00:32:11,00:32:12,because you're not being constantly
00:32:12,00:32:14,annoyed by the sound of your own footsteps.
00:32:14,00:32:15,Yes.
00:32:15,00:32:17,So this is the thing with conversation in humans.
00:32:17,00:32:21,As in when your-- it's why it's quite tricky to develop
00:32:21,00:32:24,"really good, kind of artificially intelligent hearing"
00:32:24,00:32:27,implants is because listening to the human brain
00:32:27,00:32:32,has an amazing ability to identify a voice in a lot of other noise.
00:32:32,00:32:32,Yeah.
00:32:32,00:32:34,"Yeah, but it does get harder when you've"
00:32:34,00:32:36,got a human voice against the background
00:32:36,00:32:37,of a lot of other human voices.
00:32:37,00:32:39,"So this gets called the cocktail party problem,"
00:32:39,00:32:42,where it's quite hard to focus on an individual voice.
00:32:42,00:32:44,"And which gets worse with age, as we know."
00:32:44,00:32:48,So one's parents will not be able to be in a loud room.
00:32:48,00:32:50,But the cocktail party problem is--
00:32:50,00:32:53,It does feel like you've just stopped them from being in a loud room.
00:32:53,00:32:56,You wouldn't enjoy it.
00:32:56,00:32:57,Andy's in there.
00:32:57,00:32:58,He's breathing.
00:32:58,00:32:59,You just--
00:32:59,00:33:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:01,00:33:03,You could see pins and things going flying
00:33:03,00:33:05,past with my huge breath.
00:33:05,00:33:08,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:08,00:33:11,And the cocktail party effects was described
00:33:11,00:33:12,by both someone called Colin Cherry.
00:33:12,00:33:15,"I think it was in the '50s or the '60s, possibly the '60s."
00:33:15,00:33:19,"And the way he tested it was, he played two sentences"
00:33:19,00:33:22,"to the study participants, one in one ear and one in the other ear."
00:33:22,00:33:24,And he told them to listen to only one of them.
00:33:24,00:33:26,So he told them which one to listen to.
00:33:26,00:33:28,And then he'd ask some questions about each sentence.
00:33:28,00:33:30,And it was the case that the one they hadn't
00:33:30,00:33:33,"been told to listen to, they couldn't really tell him anything about it."
00:33:33,00:33:35,"To the extent that if the other voice,"
00:33:35,00:33:38,"the other sentence in their ear, was in a different language,"
00:33:38,00:33:40,they very often hadn't even noticed that.
00:33:40,00:33:44,So that's how good we are at zoning out the stuff we're not
00:33:44,00:33:46,supposed to be listening to.
00:33:46,00:33:47,Yeah.
00:33:47,00:33:49,And this is also called that because I think this is right
00:33:49,00:33:51,"that you hear, if someone says your name,"
00:33:51,00:33:54,"you kind of just hear that really, really loud"
00:33:54,00:33:56,if you're in a cocktail party.
00:33:56,00:33:58,"Or in fact, very bad advice for a cocktail party."
00:33:58,00:34:00,"A discovery that was made recently,"
00:34:00,00:34:04,"if someone speaks who you love, then you'll hear them."
00:34:04,00:34:06,So they did this study where they
00:34:06,00:34:07,exposed people to a lot of peripheral sound.
00:34:07,00:34:09,And then they have someone they don't
00:34:09,00:34:10,know say something to them.
00:34:10,00:34:13,And then they have their spouse say something to them.
00:34:13,00:34:16,"And people are much, much better at understanding"
00:34:16,00:34:17,and hearing what their spouses said.
00:34:17,00:34:18,"Hang on, sorry."
00:34:18,00:34:19,Do we know what the reason for that is?
00:34:19,00:34:20,Is it just--
00:34:20,00:34:21,They haven't speculated.
00:34:21,00:34:23,"It's quite new, but I--"
00:34:23,00:34:24,Evolutionally?
00:34:24,00:34:24,Maybe.
00:34:24,00:34:26,"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, because the one"
00:34:26,00:34:28,"you want to reproduce with, so--"
00:34:28,00:34:29,They are going home.
00:34:29,00:34:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:32,00:34:37,It's important to get that message when it comes to you.
00:34:37,00:34:40,Plants can hear themselves being eaten.
00:34:40,00:34:41,What?
00:34:41,00:34:42,That is dark.
00:34:42,00:34:43,Yeah.
00:34:43,00:34:44,Hang on.
00:34:44,00:34:47,Think about that halfway through your next salad.
00:34:47,00:34:49,They can sense the vibrations caused
00:34:49,00:34:52,"by, for example, a caterpillar eating their leaves."
00:34:52,00:34:54,"Yeah, so I think, for instance, let's say"
00:34:54,00:34:56,there's a plant being eaten by a caterpillar.
00:34:56,00:34:57,"They can sense it, as you say."
00:34:57,00:35:00,And then they'll give off some defense.
00:35:00,00:35:00,Exactly.
00:35:00,00:35:02,So scientists tested this by putting
00:35:02,00:35:04,some caterpillars on a cabbage plant.
00:35:04,00:35:06,"They recorded the sounds of the caterpillars going,"
00:35:06,00:35:08,"ow, ow, ow, ow."
00:35:08,00:35:09,And then they played--
00:35:09,00:35:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:11,00:35:13,That was a lot of that.
00:35:13,00:35:14,That was a really good impression.
00:35:14,00:35:15,"Yeah, I thought it was."
00:35:15,00:35:17,I think you're going to be on the audio book of the very
00:35:17,00:35:18,hungry caterpillar.
00:35:18,00:35:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:21,00:35:23,But what's with the caterpillar's breathing problem
00:35:23,00:35:24,in this audio book?
00:35:24,00:35:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:28,00:35:31,Is this the very asthmatic caterpillar?
00:35:31,00:35:33,It's the very sexy caterpillar we like.
00:35:33,00:35:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:36,00:35:37,Did you get to the end of that?
00:35:37,00:35:40,No.
00:35:40,00:35:41,They put the caterpillars on a cabbage plant.
00:35:41,00:35:43,They recorded the sounds of the meeting.
00:35:43,00:35:45,And then they played the vibrations back
00:35:45,00:35:47,to a group of plants who were not actually
00:35:47,00:35:49,being eaten by caterpillars.
00:35:49,00:35:52,"And those plants heard those vibrations,"
00:35:52,00:35:53,"and they thought, I'm being eaten."
00:35:53,00:35:54,Wow.
00:35:54,00:35:56,So I don't know if your actual salad
00:35:56,00:36:00,will be able to detect and protect itself.
00:36:00,00:36:02,I think the salad is generally dead.
00:36:02,00:36:03,Yeah.
00:36:03,00:36:04,"Although, like a carrot, for instance,"
00:36:04,00:36:06,"a carrot often can be alive when you eat it,"
00:36:06,00:36:08,and you can see that by the fact that if you cut the top off
00:36:08,00:36:10,"and then put it in some water, it'll grow."
00:36:10,00:36:11,"So yeah, that could do."
00:36:11,00:36:14,I have a fact about the relationship between your eyes
00:36:14,00:36:15,and your ears.
00:36:15,00:36:19,"When you move your eyes, your ear drums move too."
00:36:19,00:36:20,And we don't know why.
00:36:20,00:36:23,"So if you sit where you are, and you just look straight ahead"
00:36:23,00:36:26,"of you, and you flick your eyes left and right, OK?"
00:36:26,00:36:29,Your ear drums are rotating with your eyes.
00:36:29,00:36:30,Wow.
00:36:30,00:36:31,Yeah.
00:36:31,00:36:32,And no one knows why.
00:36:32,00:36:34,And this is the amazing thing.
00:36:34,00:36:38,The ear drums actually move 10 milliseconds before your eyes do.
00:36:38,00:36:39,What's that?
00:36:39,00:36:40,So the brain is saying--
00:36:40,00:36:42,"No, they're controlling the eyes."
00:36:42,00:36:44,"The brain is saying, well, they're not controlling it."
00:36:44,00:36:44,The brain's controlling everything.
00:36:44,00:36:47,"But the brain says, I'm going to move the eyes."
00:36:47,00:36:50,"So ear drums, please get into position."
00:36:50,00:36:53,"Can I not trick it, and so just like--"
00:36:53,00:36:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:56,00:36:57,Because you are--
00:36:57,00:36:59,I don't know if you're clever than your own brain.
00:36:59,00:37:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:02,00:37:04,I reckon James thinks he is.
00:37:04,00:37:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:06,00:37:07,That is amazing.
00:37:07,00:37:09,He has been holding me but my whole life.
00:37:09,00:37:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:12,00:37:13,"OK, that's it."
00:37:13,00:37:14,That is all of our facts.

00:37:46,00:37:48,"No, he doesn't have a house."
00:37:48,00:37:48,"Oh, Anna."
00:37:48,00:37:49,OK.
00:37:49,00:37:51,So there's a great fact that there was a British man
00:37:51,00:37:54,who changed his name to Tim--
00:37:54,00:37:57,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:37:57,00:38:02,--a price just so telemarketers would have trouble pronouncing it.
00:38:02,00:38:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:05,00:38:06,Thanks.
00:38:06,00:38:07,That's awesome.
00:38:07,00:38:09,You nailed it.
00:38:09,00:38:10,"OK, that's it."
