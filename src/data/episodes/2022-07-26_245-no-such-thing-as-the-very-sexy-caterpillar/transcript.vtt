00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.040
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.040
 (electronic music)

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.940
 (electronic music)

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.280
 (audience cheering)

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.380
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.180
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.160
 This week coming to you from our book of the year,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.820
 2018 Tour Live in Britain.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.820
 (audience cheering)

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.300
 My name is Dash Shriver and I'm sitting here

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.820
 with Anarch Zinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.660
 and James Harkin and once again,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.180
 we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.020
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.540
 and in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.820
 Starting with fact number one and that's my fact this week.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.820
 My fact is Australia's first police force

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.220
 was made up of Australia's 12 best-behaved convicts.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.020
 (audience laughing)

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.620
 - Wow, it's weird you didn't do this fact

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.500
 when we actually were in Australia then.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.680
 (audience laughing)

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.620
 - And it's weird that we hope to go back again.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.140
 (audience laughing)

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.220
 - So this is because when they got there,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.420
 the first fleets that went out to Australia,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.660
 they were very under-prepared.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.380
 They barely brought any agricultural equipment.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.940
 They sort of arrived and just went,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.700
 "Okay, we just need to make do."

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.660
 So they had a few people like the Royal Navy

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.260
 who were out there, the British Royal Navy,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.140
 who were trying to police a few things,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.740
 but that wasn't their job and it's not what they were doing.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.020
 So they said, "We need a police force."

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.740
 And they realized we have no police.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.420
 So they looked around and went,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.020
 "Okay, who are the best-behaved convicts that we've got here?"

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.780
 They found these 12 people and they're like,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.780
 "Would you be the police?"

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.500
 And they were like, "Yeah, of course, that's it."

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.420
 - So dream, what, how do they define best-behaved?

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.180
 I don't know, I use what the 12 best-behaved people

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.620
 in society out of all of them.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.940
 - I guess maybe they might be looking at the crimes

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.460
 that they were sent over for because the criminals

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.540
 that got sent over was for very basic things,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.340
 as we know, is for stealing a bit of bread

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.420
 or urinating on the streets or--

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.460
 - Well, there are a lot of different things

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.300
 you could get sent for.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.140
 - There was a murderers.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.620
 - I made up the urinating on the streets one,

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.060
 but I imagine that might have been a thing.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.900
 - So you could get sent there for recommending

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.460
 that politicians get paid?

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.740
 - No, no, what?

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.260
 - You could get sent there for stealing fish,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.140
 for starting a union.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.300
 There was, in 1843, a guy called James Prido

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.260
 was transported for bestiality with a donkey.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.540
 And in 1850, Lieutenant Robert Gates

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.060
 was sent to Australia for striking Queen Victoria

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.580
 with a cane.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.580
 - Wow.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.540
 I agree with that one, do you?

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.780
 - With him doing it, with him being sent away.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.220
 - With him being sent to Australia, right?

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.740
 - Okay, actually, there were quite a lot of bestialities.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.180
 There's a list. - Sorry, can I just clarify?

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.660
 I was not talking about the bestiality one.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.060
 I was talking about--

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.660
 - You don't need to feel bad about it, Andy, okay?

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.500
 - I don't feel bad about it.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.940
 There's nothing to feel bad about.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.260
 - Okay, no, the Australian government actually has a list

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.740
 of all the crimes that people were transported for.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.020
 So I was reading through this list

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.820
 and there are 13 for bestiality,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.060
 but there are some that are really weird.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.700
 So one is bad notes.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.700
 What does that mean? - Bad notes.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.260
 - Oh. - 27 people for bad notes.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.260
 - Counterfeiting money?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.100
 - Yeah, I guess so.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.620
 - There was, counterfeiting was a separate one, weirdly.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.940
 I also learned a new word.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.780
 It said that about 40 people were done for hammer sucking,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.940
 which I've never heard of.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.060
 - Hammer sucking? - Hammer sucking.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.900
 - Yeah.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.220
 Do you guys know that word?

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.060
 - No.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.060
 - So I think this must have just gone out of use.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.780
 It means to break into someone's house

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.940
 and assault them with the intention of assaulting them.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.060
 - And it's different to-- - Assault them with the intention

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.860
 of assaulting them.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.780
 - Sorry.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.500
 To break into someone's house with the intention

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.060
 of assaulting someone and then assault them.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.260
 As opposed to stew-threaf, which people were also sent for.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.580
 - What? - Yeah.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.620
 Stew-threaf.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.500
 These are just words that I'd never heard.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.340
 - Do we know what that is?

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.660
 - Yeah, that's breaking into someone's house

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.300
 without the intention of assaulting someone,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.740
 but someone pops up so you have to assault them anyway.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.540
 (audience laughing)

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.980
 - Oh, it's really hard to prove

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.060
 when we were in the house, when you were hammer sucking

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.660
 or stew-threaf and-- - In a way you need the victim

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.220
 to go, it was my fault really for popping up.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.060
 (audience laughing)

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.580
 - That's some very specific ones though.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.100
 So it really goes down to detail, especially with theft.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.820
 There was theft of a hairbrush, one person,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.780
 got sent to Australia for that.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.980
 Theft of six chickens, 17 people.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.220
 17 separate people stole six chickens.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.740
 Theft of bacon, the theft of shovels.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.580
 People are stealing left, right, and center.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.740
 And yeah, they were all getting sent away.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.260
 - So one thing that happened when you boarded

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.660
 the transport ships was you got given a bag of cloth

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.700
 if you were a woman.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.820
 So Elizabeth Frye, who's the social reformer,

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.100
 she's on bank notes now.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.940
 She's on the five pound note.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.460
 She on the current five pound note?

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.140
 Think she is. - Anyone?

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.540
 - No. - No, all right.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.660
 - Not according to that one man

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.780
 who I'm gonna trust, completely.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.500
 (audience laughing)

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.020
 - Someone check a five pound note.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.540
 Surely someone has a five pound note.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.620
 - She definitely has been on the five pound note.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.860
 But anyway, she had this kind of social program going,

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.420
 which was if you're a woman being transported to Australia,

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.340
 as you boarded she or her representatives,

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.700
 would give you a bag and it contained lots of scraps

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.620
 of cloth and needles and thread.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.860
 And the idea was that you could make a quilt

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.780
 on your way over and then sell it when you got there

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.100
 to give yourself a tiny financial start.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.380
 - But everyone else has also got a quilt

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.140
 'cause they've also been on the boat.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.860
 - You wanna really diversify, don't you?

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.900
 - You're just quilt swapping.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.700
 Is it entire society of quilt swapping?

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.180
 (laughing)

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.220
 - Which was a separate offense.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.460
 You could be sent to Australia for actually.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.940
 - One thing I really love about that is,

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.860
 so you were badly behaved in Britain

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.500
 and you got sent to Australia.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.540
 But if you were badly behaved in Australia,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.860
 then they'd send you even further to North of Ireland.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.540
 So you go to one more island.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.540
 And I wanna know what happens

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.340
 if you're badly behaved in North of Ireland?

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.420
 What happens then?

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.420
 Back to Britain.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.780
 (laughing)

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.900
 - Going around and around.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.660
 Yeah, Northern Ireland was very bad, wasn't it?

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.500
 - Yeah, it was horrible.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.900
 - In fact, I think people used to

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.740
 on North of Ireland try and commit other crimes

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.900
 'cause what you would get is a death penalty.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.700
 And for that, you get sent back to Australia

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.580
 and you'd be on death row

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.540
 and they thought that's way better

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.180
 than this terrible North of Ireland, please.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.020
 - Wow.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.260
 - I've heard of the Cascade's female factory.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.100
 - No.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.140
 - So this was somewhere where again, it was,

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.180
 so I think most of the people who were transportable men,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.940
 it was maybe 80%.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.740
 But the Cascade's female factory

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.420
 was a kind of workhouse for female convicts

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.100
 when they were sent over.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.060
 It was a kind of distillery slash prison.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.260
 And when they were in there,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.780
 they weren't allowed to speak to men, these women.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.340
 But they did devise a scheme

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.820
 where they bribed a corrupt water.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.580
 And I swear to God, this is what the source I have says.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.660
 It says, they smuggled love letters

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.460
 to the men they wanted to communicate with inside chickens.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.060
 (laughing)

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.380
 - No, we know why they were stealing all those chickens.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.420
 (laughing)

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.820
 - They smuggled love letters inside chickens.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:46.660
 - Yeah.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.900
 - They were living chickens or dead chickens.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.780
 - Or were inside.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.740
 - I think it goes in the bit where the egg comes out.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.820
 - Okay, not through the beak or under the wing.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.900
 (laughing)

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.740
 - That's what I do.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.900
 - These guys in this factory,

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.540
 they famously protested in 1832.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.620
 And the way that they did that

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.180
 is the governor of Van Diemensland,

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.140
 which is now Tasmania, came along.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.180
 And turning right around, and at one impulse,

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.380
 they pulled up their clothes, showing the naked posterias,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.340
 which they simultaneously smacked with their hands,

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.260
 making a loud and not very musical noise.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.220
 (laughing)

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.860
 And on another occasion,

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.020
 some dozen or 20 women seized the governor,

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.140
 took off his trousers and deliberately endeavoured

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.820
 to deprive him of his manhood.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.660
 - Wow.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.340
 - It's not what you want.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.700
 - Now what happened to the chickens doesn't sound so bad,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.540
 doesn't it?

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.820
 (laughing)

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.540
 - People always think that I think the people

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.980
 that were sent over to Australia, though,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.780
 were kind of from the lowest of the low in society,

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.860
 like the really lower class working classes.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.180
 But it was a whole range of people,

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.020
 it was basically anyone unwanted in Britain.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.620
 So there was really a good article by Thomas Cannelli,

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.060
 you know, the Australian author,

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.260
 who was describing the kind of people that would go.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.580
 And he was thinking there was a lot of members

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.620
 of the gentry in the bourgeoisie,

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.060
 but people who sort of had gambling debts

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.460
 or who'd got themselves into trouble,

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.620
 or he said bluff English lads who weren't particularly good

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.300
 academically or who had impregnated the maid.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.500
 And then you've got to go.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.100
 But do you know, just because, so Ned Kelly

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.300
 is obviously relevant to this.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.980
 So this police force was created

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.860
 and the police became quite corrupt and hated.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.700
 And then you got these rebels in Australia

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.260
 who were kind of hero villains.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.340
 And Ned Kelly is the main one.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.620
 But I didn't know that the world's first feature length film

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.180
 was the Kelly Gang.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.500
 So it was the story of the Kelly Gang.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.020
 It was made in 1906, and it was banned almost immediately,

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.500
 because it was shown in Australia in cinemas.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.940
 It was super successful.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.780
 And then people started committing kind of imitation crimes.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.180
 So a bunch of kids went and held up a photography warehouse,

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.300
 I think, and stole a bunch of stuff from it

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.060
 and held up some schoolchildren at gunpoint.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.540
 And what?

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.380
 They canceled.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.980
 So everyone was fine.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.180
 So yeah, they canceled it.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.500
 But it was really successful.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.260
 And the reviewers got kind of annoyed about it

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.060
 because the way they did films in those days was people

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.180
 went to the cinema and they showed the film.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.180
 And they also had a lecturer standing by the side

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.060
 of it explaining the action as it happened,

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.820
 because obviously no sound.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.580
 And then they had actors behind the screen

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.220
 who were giving it the dialogue.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:21.740
 So--

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.340
 Wow.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.300
 --and apparently the Kelly dialogue and sound effects

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.060
 were so loud that it really upset people

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.020
 who were used to quiet silent films.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.620
 So there was something called the Kelly Belogruf,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.740
 which reviewers referred to, which

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.100
 was going to the cinema to see the Ned Kelly film.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.060
 And you just, like, be deffined by these thunder claps

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.100
 that they were doing behind the screen.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.940
 I love the idea of a lecturer.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.380
 Just by the side, who's just filling you in on,

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.140
 who everyone is, every scene.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.540
 For any Marvel superhero film, I would like that.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.540
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.060
 Just why are we all trying to get the rocks?

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.220
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.860
 Just speaking of famous Australian convicts

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.940
 from that period.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.340
 So Ned Kelly, more an outlaw than a convict initially.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.380
 There was a guy called Moon Dine Joe.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.100
 Moon Dine was the place he was from.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.380
 And this guy, he'd arrived with the boats.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.900
 I don't think it was the very first fleet.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.460
 But he kind of served his sentence there.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.580
 And he was let free.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.540
 And he-- so they must have sorted out that system that--

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.700
 oh, so they had a problem with earlier.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.780
 And he started doing things like branding cows for himself

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:28.380
 and keeping them.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.700
 So he got arrested and put back in prison.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.700
 But he escaped.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.540
 So then he got arrested again and put back in prison.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.460
 And then he escaped.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.340
 And then he got arrested again.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.820
 And he just kept escaping.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.420
 And there was nothing that they could do.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.700
 So they eventually had to build him his own custom cell,

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.820
 just completely on their own.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.020
 And they said to him that if he escaped that,

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.340
 all would be forgiven.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.300
 He's like, you go free.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.580
 We don't know what to do with you if you were escaped.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.100
 Wow.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:50.700
 Did he escape?

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.420
 You're not going to believe this.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.940
 I forgot to write down the answers to that.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.420
 Oh, my God.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.140
 When in that story did you realize that you didn't have the answer?

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.420
 You knew when I was going, and then he escaped.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.980
 And then he was in that moment.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.460
 I think I saw it in a few more escapes.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.140
 So this is where my lecturer system will be able to sweep it

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.020
 and say he did not escape.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.740
 I looked up modern Aussie police.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:11.740
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.900
 It might be interesting to see what they're up to.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.180
 So there's a town in Queensland called Birdsville.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.180
 And it's amazing.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.540
 So it has one police officer.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.620
 And it's Birdsville and the surrounding region.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.420
 And his jurisdiction is the same size as the United Kingdom.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.340
 Wow.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.780
 It's 93,000 square miles.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.300
 Wow.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.060
 What does he do?

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:33.940
 He drives around.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:34.740
 He drives a lot.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.340
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.540
 A lot of mileage expenses, yeah.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.300
 So because it's a tiny town.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.380
 It says the population signs say the population is 115

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.780
 plus or minus 7,000.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.620
 Because there's a horse race in September,

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.340
 which brings a lot of tourists.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.420
 So almost all year it's 115, and then September is 7,000.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.940
 And Buzzfeed wrote this huge long piece all about him,

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.940
 and they interviewed him.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.420
 And the piece says about Birdsville.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.340
 If you want to buy a coffee, you have one option,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.500
 the Birdsville Bakery.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.620
 If you want to visit a restaurant,

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.780
 you have one option, the Birdsville Hotel.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.500
 If you want to see a film or live music,

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.660
 you are in the wrong town.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.100
 Well, he's not getting re-employed by the tourist

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:16.980
 department for Birdsville.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.860
 What are you saying?

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.980
 As I was Googling all this stuff and Googling Australia,

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.660
 I found something that I just want to share,

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.500
 even though it's not really on topic.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.220
 And it was a new story that a 21-year-old Australian

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.460
 has been labelled the unluckiest man in Australia,

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.820
 after he was bitten by a spider on the penis

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.380
 for the second time in five months.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.380
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.740
 It was his first visit to a portable toilet

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.860
 since his last encounter with a spider.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.220
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.060
 It was the same spider.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.940
 It saw him coming in as well.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.460
 I'm going to get you again.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.500
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.740
 Oh, my God.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.740
 Oh, my God.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.700
 His family, honestly, it'll be fine.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.340
 It's a $1 billion chance.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.300
 Oh, the worst thing, I mean, this is so sad.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.420
 But he went to the hospital, and all the nurses

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.700
 remembered him from the last time.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.500
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.060
 Should we move on to what you think is just what

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.740
 the Aussie police these days have to deal with.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.420
 I just looked up recent Australian crimes.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:21.380
 And there was one who was a man who was a drunk driver

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.500
 who started driving laps around the car park

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.460
 of a Sydney branch of McDonald's after they

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:32.020
 refused to sell him 200 chicken nuggets at 5 a.m. on Remembrance Day.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.180
 He started screaming, I want my effing nuggets.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.340
 I'm going to eff you up.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.940
 He drove around a load of laps before changing his mind

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.860
 and asking for 200 hash browns in stakes.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:45.100
 It was breakfast time.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.040
 Police were called, but before they made a sure rest

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.940
 in, the perpetrator had demanded a refund,

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.740
 but was unable to remember what he had ordered

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.540
 and wanted a refund for.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.460
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.500
 Not for nothing, did those brave men and women

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.380
 sacrifice themselves?

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.140
 Anyway, we hope to be touring Australia again next year.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.340
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinsky.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.660
 My fact this week is that in the first newspaper crosswords,

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.500
 the answers did not have to be actual words.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.100
 So this is just this so weird thing.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.780
 I was reading the telegraph released a book of the history

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.580
 of its own crosswords, and it talks about their first crosswords,

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.780
 which was in 1925.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.500
 And I think that was pretty much the earliest newspaper crosswords

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.220
 in the UK was in 1925.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.460
 And you would have clues like, I don't know how much, if one

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.540
 knows about cryptic crosswords, I assume everything.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.380
 Stop it, everyone.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.300
 If you've gone an anagram in a cryptic crossword,

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.260
 you'll have a word like muddle or mix up, which

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.380
 shows you it's an anagram.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.420
 And then you know you've got to mix up the letters.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.740
 But in one of these early crosswords,

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.500
 the clue was just a muddled life.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:01.660
 And the answer was ilf-ilf-e, not a real word, or--

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.420
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.700
 You want to show me its file, and you've just got it wrong.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.500
 It's ilf.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.580
 It's ilf otherwise it didn't work.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.420
 Another one I liked, and this really is for the cryptic fans,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.620
 so apologies, everyone else.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.500
 But this has its tail dislocated.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.740
 It means you take the word this, and you take the tail of it,

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.500
 which is the end, which is the s, and you just

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.140
 the case it, and put it on the front.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.220
 So the answer was c-thee.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.940
 But there was a moral panic about crosswords

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.460
 when they were first really popular.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.140
 So the first modern crossword was in a New York world,

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.780
 which was a magazine in 1913.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.020
 But in the '20s, they became really popular.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:50.900
 And in 1924, the New York Times said that they were a sinful waste.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.140
 And they said that the utterly futile finding of words

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.860
 was a primitive sort of mental exercise.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.940
 But they added, fortunately, the question

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.900
 of whether the puzzles are beneficial or harmful

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.820
 is in no urgent need of an answer.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.980
 The craze is evidently dying out fast.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.300
 In a few months, it will be forgotten.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.740
 They also had the libraries of New York

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.380
 complained that people doing crosswords were ruining

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.580
 libraries because they were coming in and dominating

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.180
 all the dictionaries when people who actually wanted

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.100
 to use dictionaries were not able to get there to use them.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.220
 So they released a statement saying that the puzzle fans

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.860
 swarmed to the dictionaries and encyclopedias.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.740
 So as to driveway readers and students

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.540
 who need these books and they're daily work,

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.300
 can there be any doubt that the library's duty to protect

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.900
 its legitimate readers?

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.980
 And it was basically-- yeah, this is the death of libraries,

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:40.700
 because these crosswords--

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.220
 As we've just learned, a dictionary is useless to you,

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.980
 filling out old crosswords, so what are they doing?

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.980
 There was a psychologist from Columbia University

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.620
 who said that crossword puzzles-- and this

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.660
 was around the same time-- he said the reason they're so

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.140
 popular is that crossword puzzles satisfied the 45

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.500
 fundamental desires of the human species.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.060
 Not all 45.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.860
 Well, I looked at a longer list of fundamental desires

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.740
 I could find, and it included curiosity, which, I think,

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.620
 is fair, order, like point things in order about works,

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:19.620
 physical activity, kind of, maybe, romance, no romance.

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.860
 I've not in any crossword I've completed.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.380
 No, vengeance.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.100
 Actually, yes, vengeance, as we can see, yeah.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.060
 I think you're doing it wrong.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.740
 And definitely doing it wrong, eating.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.700
 That's what you do at the end.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.100
 That's why they're always on rice paper.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.500
 There was apparently people started writing into zoos

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.060
 and demanding of the zookeepers to know a three-letter word,

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.540
 which meant a female swan, and things like that.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.940
 Yeah, because back in the day, I guess

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.700
 there was no internet to just sort of when you've given up.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.220
 Exactly.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.700
 You just had to write to a zookeeper.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.980
 Yeah.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.260
 That reminds me.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.820
 And there was no internet as well.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:55.980
 And there was a new story.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.140
 Maybe one of you guys found it.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.980
 I haven't written it down, but it was--

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.260
 there was a guy in the UK somewhere,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.420
 and he was doing a crossword.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.820
 He was about 80 years old, but he had the internet.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.660
 It was about five or 10 years ago.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.780
 And the question was, Asian Ass.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.580
 And he decided to look it up on the internet.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.140
 Oh, no.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.420
 And he said, basically, he didn't know this kind of thing existed.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.780
 Although it does rather sound like his wife came down

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.540
 and said, what are you looking at?

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.420
 Yeah.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.700
 Apparently going through 1,000 crosswords

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:33.060
 to find any clue which might explain it.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.340
 I found a crossword that I really like.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.860
 It's an art piece, which has been displayed in art galleries.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.020
 And it was lent to Nuremberg's Newers Museum.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.540
 And it was up there.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:49.100
 And a 90-year-old woman went to see it and filled it in.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.220
 And it was worth 68,000 pounds.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.820
 And it is surely worth more when it's completed.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.500
 Well, her argument is it's fine.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.700
 In that case, I've got some crossword books to sell you.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:07.140
 This one's worth a fortune, and it's completely completed.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.580
 It's a pretty good point.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.580
 Yeah, no.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.260
 She only got a couple in before someone noticed

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.740
 that she was writing on a bit of art on the wall.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.620
 And so, yeah, so she got in trouble.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.020
 They raised out her contribution to it.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.940
 But she has claimed that she now holds copyright

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:23.820
 because it's a new work.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.420
 She's now a collaborator.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.220
 Right.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.220
 We'll fill through all Avengers.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.900
 You're right, yeah.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.820
 I like-- so crossword setters are always kind of heroes.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.900
 But one of the first ones was Arthur Winn.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.540
 I think he was the first one who set the New York World One.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.420
 And the first crossword puzzle he set to try and convince

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.100
 his publishers-- this is the thing worth doing--

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.380
 the new type of publishers.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.140
 He-- the word dove appeared twice.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.660
 So it's the first ever crossword.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.340
 You've got the entire dictionary and non-dictionary,

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.940
 apparently, at your disposal.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.460
 And he couldn't think of something that wasn't dove

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.460
 for that second clue.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.140
 One was at the same clue, or--

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.580
 No, one clue was bird, and one was pigeon.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.260
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.580
 Yep, couldn't-- and then the other words were just bizarre.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.700
 It had the word nafe, female surf.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.620
 And then it also had doff as in Homer Simpson.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.380
 Don't know, right?

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:15.900
 Yeah.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.420
 Wow.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.860
 It was the original dove.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.380
 What was the clue?

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.060
 It was Homer Simpson's catchphrase.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.980
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.500
 Wow.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.580
 How do they work, they back in the day?

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.540
 And he-- do you know what he published it as?

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.700
 It wasn't called a crossword.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.260
 Oh, it was called-- it was called a word cross.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.340
 Yeah, that was the original.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.020
 At some point down the line, we went better the other way, man.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:40.940
 No, it wasn't that.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.340
 It was a few weeks later.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.420
 It was a mess up in the type setting.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.420
 Really?

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.820
 Switched it round to crossword as a guy way.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:47.820
 And the guy way.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.780
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:56.580
 Actually, just on that weird words, there was a guy called--

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.180
 an editor called Arthur Maurice, who noticed that the words

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.020
 that Americans were using in the late 1920s

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.580
 were a lot shorter and had more vowels in them

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.140
 than they were before that.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.020
 And he put it down to the crossword craze.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.020
 Basically, he's saying, if you're writing crosswords,

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.500
 you need lots of these small words, like Doha or whatever.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.140
 And actually, he noticed that more people

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.940
 are using words such as a bet, acute, adept,

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.940
 eek, elan, eon, things like that.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.460
 Right.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.180
 So it actually changed the way that people speak.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.740
 What were the four people saying?

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.300
 Oh, Zephyr and Oh, Rhythm.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.540
 And I kind of think of a single other word, which is--

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.220
 That would only be "Constance."

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.220
 It's just like, pal, crystal palace.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:35.460
 Yeah, crystal palace.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.620
 Crystal.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.540
 I still can't believe they're the longest words

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.780
 that your two collective minds can come up with.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:41.780
 Consonance.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.540
 Just loads of consonants.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.900
 Could a consonant have been heavy?

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.980
 Please, the floor of the walls.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.980
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:50.820
 Latch, don't.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.460
 Don't help her with crosswords at the moment.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.020
 You're not allowed to use crosswords at the moment.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.100
 It's drink-neen.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:55.860
 Right, surely.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.660
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.660
 You're right.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.700
 Lots of setters have their own characteristics,

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.620
 and they all have their own not-powers.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.140
 But their own ideas are really--

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.820
 I really don't understand the Marvel movies, do you?

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.620
 I thought it was so little crossword action in the later one.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.540
 I'm tempted not to go back.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.060
 There are a few than a hundred professional crossword

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.460
 setters in the UK, for me three reasons.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.180
 It's quite a niche thing to be doing.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.180
 But there is one setter called Mark Bremen.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.820
 And this year, he launched what he said

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.460
 was the hardest in the world.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.580
 He estimated that it would take two years to complete.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.500
 He said, I'm not saying that this crossword cannot be completed,

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.900
 because, of course, it can.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.700
 But nonetheless, it is finitially tough

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.500
 and significantly harder than anything

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.140
 I've ever compiled before.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.540
 Based on the feedback of other compilers who have seen it

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.140
 or tried it, mine is about 100 times harder.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.980
 If that description is indeed correct,

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.500
 then it stands to reason that it would

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.580
 take the average enthusiast a hundred times longer to solve it.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.700
 This amounts to 100 weeks or just over two years.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.820
 It was solved within two hours.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.540
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.300
 He hadn't even finished that speech.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.740
 To be honest, I lost faith in him when he said,

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.980
 it amounts to 100 weeks or just over two years.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.460
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.940
 That's when he knows he's got some miscalculations going on.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.740
 The guy he solved it said, some of the clues were definitely

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.740
 tricky, but two years would be a stretch.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.940
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.100
 Just on the question setters, the New York Times

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.900
 had quite a fun run last year of a whole year

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.700
 of celebrity question setters.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.340
 So Bill Clinton wrote a crossword for them.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.860
 And my favorite one, Weird Al Yankovich wrote one.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.900
 If you guys remember Weird Al Yankovich, he wrote one.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.820
 So his was mainly filled with cheese-based puns.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.140
 So he, like, answers that were allowed with fetter attraction

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.060
 and a few good men.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:50.580
 Yeah.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.700
 But interestingly, they set rules to it.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.420
 So he was disqualified when he tried to get a clue

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.780
 in where the answer was, fondue the right thing.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.700
 And they said, we have strict cheeses

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.380
 that you're allowed to use in this crossword.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.580
 And fondue is not a cheese.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:04.340
 It's a style.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.540
 So if you're doing a cheese crossword,

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.020
 you have to really stick within the cheese category.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.860
 Yeah, it has to be just a cheese, I guess, within the word.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.700
 Yogg, that's mostly consonants.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.740
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.300
 Didn't know you were still playing that game.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:24.100
 I'm going to be playing it all the way home, eh?

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.820
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.620
 My fact is that in the German Renaissance,

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.220
 it was briefly fashionable for women

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.980
 to have themselves painted as a biblical character halfway

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.980
 through decapitating a man.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:43.580
 So there's this biblical story, which is of Judith and Halophanes.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.380
 I think that's how it's pronounced.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.780
 But he's dead, so it doesn't matter.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.940
 There's a biblical story of Judith and Halophanes.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.300
 And Halophanes is a very brutal general who

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.580
 is about to destroy Judith's home city.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.340
 And he's outside the city.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:02.420
 She is a widow, and he lets her into his tent

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.580
 because he fancies her, basically.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.660
 And she comes in, and she gets him drunk.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.860
 He passes out, and she decapitates him.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.100
 And she takes the head away in a basket.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.860
 So she's quite a heroic figure.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.540
 This is Old Testament stuff, obviously.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.020
 And there was an artist in the German Renaissance

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.940
 called Kranach, Lucas Kranach, the elder.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.580
 And he painted eight different versions of this scene.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:28.780
 So loads of artists have painted it.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.100
 Caravaggio did it.

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.620
 Dozens and dozens of artists have painted it over the centuries.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.300
 But there are at least eight different tutors that he painted.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.980
 And they're all wearing modern dress.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.060
 And they've all got completely different looks.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.300
 And we now believe that several different women

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.740
 in the Saxon court commissioned paintings of themselves

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.500
 halfway through to capitating a man.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.340
 That's so cool.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.020
 And we should clarify, when you say modern dress,

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.940
 you mean the modern dress of the time?

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.900
 No, no, no, no.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:56.900
 I mean, they were in modern 21st century power business suits.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:01.740
 That's-- it speaks to sort of a burgeoning angry feminism,

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.460
 doesn't it, that women have suddenly gone,

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.860
 God, I'm allowed to be painted to capitating somebody.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:06.780
 Brilliant.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:10.740
 And this, just for anyone who thinks they don't recognize this

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.620
 from the Bible, it's not in the Protestant version

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.140
 of the Old Testament that people use.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.020
 It is in the Catholic version.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.980
 And most people think that it's--

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.980
 I mean, what they think of the whole Bible, I don't know.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.220
 But everyone knows that this is non-historical.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.420
 And some people have called it the first historical novel,

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.980
 because it's so obviously not true,

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.660
 because there's a lot of anachronisms

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.620
 and, you know, nebuchadesses in here.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.860
 Andachronisms, she's wearing a wrist watch at one point.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.140
 It doesn't stack up.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.660
 A seven-four, seven flew over her, and this is implausible.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.100
 Did you know, just speaking of a fashion in art,

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.580
 a fashion in art for painting Mary Magdalene,

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.580
 covered in hair from head to toe?

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:50.580
 No.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.580
 This is so weird.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:52.660
 Well, like a big foot.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:53.700
 Yep.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.700
 She looks like a Yeti.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.340
 And this is a trend in medieval art,

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.860
 pictures of Mary Magdalene, a covered in hair.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:04.540
 And it's because she was sort of often referred

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.420
 to as having very long hair, and it sort of covered her

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.100
 genitals sometimes in art.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.740
 And it seemed to grow out of that in some versions

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.300
 of the telling of her story.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.660
 It was that after Jesus died, then she became a desert hermit

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.860
 and repentant of her prostitution and stuff.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.340
 And she stopped caring about her parents at all,

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.140
 so all of her clothes fell off eventually.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.620
 And then a sort of a mercy god covered her in hair.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.580
 And there were these paintings of her all over medieval art.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.740
 And she looks like a Yeti.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.540
 I don't know.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.900
 She's covered in hair, head to toe,

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.500
 but with a face of skin.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.820
 That's so weird.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.820
 And also they used to paint Moses with horns, didn't they?

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.060
 They did.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:47.380
 And they reckon that that was maybe a mis-translation or something?

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.740
 Yeah, they thought it was a Bible mis-translation

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.940
 because it was describing him coming down the mountains.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.340
 And so they were doing it purely out of we think

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.460
 that this is what was written.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.140
 So there's a word that is Karen, like the name Karen.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.900
 And in Hebrew it can either mean horn or ray of light.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.420
 So he came down with a ray of light in the Bible,

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.260
 but some guy misread it and just went,

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.980
 "I probably had horns."

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.700
 There is a painter called Daphne Todd.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.780
 And she is a modern portrait painter.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.900
 And she revealed a few years ago that she was commissioned

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.580
 to paint someone who was extremely rude

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.220
 and extremely uncooperative all the way

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.140
 through the portrait painting process.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.260
 And as a result, she has given that man a pair of horns

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.420
 in the painting and then painted over it with his hair.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.180
 But in 50 or 100 years' time, it's going to be revealed

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.660
 that this guy has horns in the painting.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:39.900
 So other fashions from Renaissance time.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.940
 The Chalping or Chalping, it was a platform shoe

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.100
 that they wore, especially around Venice.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.300
 And the idea was, you are it over your shoes

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.140
 because the ground was terrible.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.380
 There was loads of poo around them, loads of mud and stuff like that.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.380
 You don't want it on your shoes.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.780
 You don't want it on your dress.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.340
 And so they got these nice high platforms.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.860
 But then it kind of turned out that the higher you got,

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.460
 the better your status was.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:04.700
 And they got higher and higher and higher and higher.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.020
 And eventually, they were getting examples

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.860
 that were over 20 inches high platform shoes in Venice.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.940
 So just to put that into context, that would put Anna,

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.220
 if you wore them, three inches taller than LeBron James,

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.340
 a basketball player.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.780
 But it is so hard to run up a basketball court in 20 years.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.460
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.420
 And that is James.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.980
 OK, my fact this week is that mice can't hear their own footsteps.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.220
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.660
 Now, is this because they are quite deaf,

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.260
 or because they walk very quietly?

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.860
 It's because they're selectively deaf.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:49.100
 So there is a noise that happens when a mouse walks.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.060
 And in theory, it could hear it.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.300
 But its brain just goes, now I'm not going to listen to that.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.660
 And it just turns it off.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.980
 And it could be that this is true of actually all animals.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.020
 And maybe a few humans as well.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.940
 Like if you walk down the street, you don't really

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.780
 notice your own footsteps.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.540
 But let's say you're walking on some gravel

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.860
 or some leaves or something, you might hear it.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:08.740
 And this is a new study that's recently

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:12.420
 been done by Janani Sundarajan and Richard

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.660
 Muni at Duke's School of Medicine.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.660
 And what they did was they put little buttons

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.220
 on the bottom of a mouse's feet.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.020
 And so as it went to long, it just made little--

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.020
 beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:26.620
 Wow.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:27.780
 It's like a little beeping noise.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:31.340
 Like, you know that movie big when he's on the keyboard.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.420
 Isn't it like that?

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:34.460
 But it was the same note every time.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.100
 And they checked the brain of the mouse.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.300
 And they realized that it could hear this--

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.940
 it's reacting to this noise.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.140
 But then as it went on after a week or two,

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.940
 it wasn't reacting to it anymore.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.740
 I bet the other mice were still reacting to it.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:51.340
 And what they found was is that basically the mice

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.660
 had been trained to just not listen to the sound anymore.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.780
 And it's just natural in their brains.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.780
 And the ones which had got used to this sound,

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:03.780
 they were much better than other mice at reacting to predators.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.340
 So if you had like a cat paw come in to get them.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.620
 The ones who couldn't hear their own footsteps

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.420
 could get out of there.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.220
 But the ones who could hear them would pot off.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.820
 They reckon that this maybe is why humans, possibly,

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.340
 not the animals, can't hear your own footsteps.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:17.860
 Yeah.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.380
 I guess the human brain is very good at zoning stuff out

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.860
 that is for pieces, right?

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.180
 Yeah, so if you're a heavy breather, for instance,

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.060
 you wouldn't necessarily know you were a heavy breather.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.420
 Everyone else would know that you were doing it,

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:28.780
 but you wouldn't necessarily know what--

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:32.060
 I mean, the people you were phoning up would know, wouldn't they?

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.740
 Yeah, I mean, like you would know if you were a heavy breather,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.660
 wouldn't you?

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.820
 And then you would know.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.820
 Yeah.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:38.980
 Oh, what are you--

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.500
 sorry, what are you saying?

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.460
 You were an extremely heavy breather.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.980
 That's not a heavy breather.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.220
 We don't need to go into it now.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.140
 No, we're normal breather.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:48.900
 You're fired.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.340
 It's very distracting in the office.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:58.740
 But yeah, I think that's it.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.460
 Can I just ask for the--

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.660
 just to make sure I get this clear.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.620
 So by cancelling out the noise, it means

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.700
 that every other dangerous noise is amplified,

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.660
 and they don't cross fire with their own noise.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.060
 Yeah, not amplified so much as you're just easier to hear

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.740
 because you're not being constantly

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.860
 annoyed by the sound of your own footsteps.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:15.380
 Yes.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.340
 So this is the thing with conversation in humans.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:21.380
 As in when your-- it's why it's quite tricky to develop

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.260
 really good, kind of artificially intelligent hearing

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.900
 implants is because listening to the human brain

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:32.100
 has an amazing ability to identify a voice in a lot of other noise.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:32.940
 Yeah.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.660
 Yeah, but it does get harder when you've

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.180
 got a human voice against the background

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:37.580
 of a lot of other human voices.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.700
 So this gets called the cocktail party problem,

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.540
 where it's quite hard to focus on an individual voice.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.580
 And which gets worse with age, as we know.

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:48.420
 So one's parents will not be able to be in a loud room.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.340
 But the cocktail party problem is--

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.900
 It does feel like you've just stopped them from being in a loud room.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.500
 You wouldn't enjoy it.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.220
 Andy's in there.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.020
 He's breathing.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.020
 You just--

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.500
 You could see pins and things going flying

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.220
 past with my huge breath.

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:08.260
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:11.420
 And the cocktail party effects was described

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.780
 by both someone called Colin Cherry.

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.900
 I think it was in the '50s or the '60s, possibly the '60s.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.100
 And the way he tested it was, he played two sentences

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.660
 to the study participants, one in one ear and one in the other ear.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.340
 And he told them to listen to only one of them.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.300
 So he told them which one to listen to.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.820
 And then he'd ask some questions about each sentence.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.340
 And it was the case that the one they hadn't

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:33.540
 been told to listen to, they couldn't really tell him anything about it.

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:35.340
 To the extent that if the other voice,

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:38.460
 the other sentence in their ear, was in a different language,

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.780
 they very often hadn't even noticed that.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:44.460
 So that's how good we are at zoning out the stuff we're not

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.500
 supposed to be listening to.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.020
 Yeah.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.660
 And this is also called that because I think this is right

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.860
 that you hear, if someone says your name,

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.500
 you kind of just hear that really, really loud

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.220
 if you're in a cocktail party.

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.620
 Or in fact, very bad advice for a cocktail party.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.620
 A discovery that was made recently,

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:04.540
 if someone speaks who you love, then you'll hear them.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.300
 So they did this study where they

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.940
 exposed people to a lot of peripheral sound.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.660
 And then they have someone they don't

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:10.900
 know say something to them.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.460
 And then they have their spouse say something to them.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.060
 And people are much, much better at understanding

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.580
 and hearing what their spouses said.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.060
 Hang on, sorry.

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.580
 Do we know what the reason for that is?

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:20.740
 Is it just--

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:21.700
 They haven't speculated.

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:23.140
 It's quite new, but I--

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.140
 Evolutionally?

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:24.820
 Maybe.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.420
 Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, because the one

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.020
 you want to reproduce with, so--

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.140
 They are going home.

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:32.380
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:37.420
 It's important to get that message when it comes to you.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.860
 Plants can hear themselves being eaten.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.700
 What?

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:42.660
 That is dark.

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:43.820
 Yeah.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:44.660
 Hang on.

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:47.740
 Think about that halfway through your next salad.

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:49.780
 They can sense the vibrations caused

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.940
 by, for example, a caterpillar eating their leaves.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.500
 Yeah, so I think, for instance, let's say

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.300
 there's a plant being eaten by a caterpillar.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.700
 They can sense it, as you say.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.020
 And then they'll give off some defense.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:00.740
 Exactly.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.580
 So scientists tested this by putting

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.500
 some caterpillars on a cabbage plant.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.900
 They recorded the sounds of the caterpillars going,

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.100
 ow, ow, ow, ow.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.300
 And then they played--

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.740
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.300
 That was a lot of that.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.700
 That was a really good impression.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:15.420
 Yeah, I thought it was.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.380
 I think you're going to be on the audio book of the very

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.220
 hungry caterpillar.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.220
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.140
 But what's with the caterpillar's breathing problem

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.060
 in this audio book?

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:28.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.420
 Is this the very asthmatic caterpillar?

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.700
 It's the very sexy caterpillar we like.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.380
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.660
 Did you get to the end of that?

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.020
 No.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.700
 They put the caterpillars on a cabbage plant.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.540
 They recorded the sounds of the meeting.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.460
 And then they played the vibrations back

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.540
 to a group of plants who were not actually

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.180
 being eaten by caterpillars.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.020
 And those plants heard those vibrations,

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.340
 and they thought, I'm being eaten.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.340
 Wow.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.300
 So I don't know if your actual salad

00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:00.420
 will be able to detect and protect itself.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.340
 I think the salad is generally dead.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.140
 Yeah.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.300
 Although, like a carrot, for instance,

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.220
 a carrot often can be alive when you eat it,

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.700
 and you can see that by the fact that if you cut the top off

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.340
 and then put it in some water, it'll grow.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.940
 So yeah, that could do.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.140
 I have a fact about the relationship between your eyes

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:15.140
 and your ears.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:19.180
 When you move your eyes, your ear drums move too.

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:20.500
 And we don't know why.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.380
 So if you sit where you are, and you just look straight ahead

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:26.660
 of you, and you flick your eyes left and right, OK?

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.620
 Your ear drums are rotating with your eyes.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.300
 Wow.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.300
 Yeah.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.700
 And no one knows why.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.340
 And this is the amazing thing.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:38.220
 The ear drums actually move 10 milliseconds before your eyes do.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.380
 What's that?

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.580
 So the brain is saying--

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.380
 No, they're controlling the eyes.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.020
 The brain is saying, well, they're not controlling it.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:44.980
 The brain's controlling everything.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.420
 But the brain says, I'm going to move the eyes.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.820
 So ear drums, please get into position.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.260
 Can I not trick it, and so just like--

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.100
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.300
 Because you are--

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.700
 I don't know if you're clever than your own brain.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.180
 I reckon James thinks he is.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:06.940
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:07.940
 That is amazing.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.900
 He has been holding me but my whole life.

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.220
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.140
 OK, that's it.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.300
 That is all of our facts.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:15.540

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.820
 NoSuchThing is a fish.com where you can find everything

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.580
 from upcoming tour dates.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.580
 You can find our book, link to our book.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.100
 You can listen to all of our previous episodes.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.100
 And actually, we're about to give away a copy now.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.140
 So, James, have you got our winner?

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:46.660
 No, he doesn't.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.060
 No, he doesn't have a house.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:48.740
 Oh, Anna.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:49.100
 OK.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.260
 So there's a great fact that there was a British man

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:54.300
 who changed his name to Tim--

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.500
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.740
 Thanks.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.740
 That's awesome.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.620
 You nailed it.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:10.740
 OK, that's it.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.820
 That is all of our facts.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:12.820
 We'll see you again next week.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:14.060
 Good bye.
