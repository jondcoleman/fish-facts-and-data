00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. Dan Shriver is

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:13,120
 not with us today, unfortunately. He is off doing community service. By which I mean he's

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,840
 doing jury duty, which means he won't be here this week or next. But in his place, we are

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:26,520
 joined by our colleague and very, very good friend, Liying Li. Now, some of you, the Super

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:33,240
 Duper Fish fans, will already know who Liying is. She has appeared on our Meet the Elves feature in

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:39,200
 Club Fish. She was so good on that that we decided to ask her onto the main podcast. I'm sure you're

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,520
 going to really enjoy it. She's absolutely brilliant. If you want to know more about all the other elves,

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,200
 then go to nosuchthingsafish.com/apple and nosuchthingsafish.com/patreon. And if you go there,

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,520
 you can hear all the other episodes of Meet the Elves, as well as Drop As Aligned, which is our

10
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,760
 mailbag show, compilations, and much, much more. Anyway, there's not much more to say today, apart

11
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,960
 from really hope you enjoy the show with Liying. And on with the podcast!

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,000
 Hello, and welcome to No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,520
 offices in Hoban. My name is Anna Tyshinski, and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,560
 Murray, and Liying Li, and we are gathered here today with our four favourite facts from the last

15
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,080
 seven days. So in no particular order, here we go. Liying, what's your fact? My fact this week is

16
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:50,560
 that during World War II, Bletchley Park was forced to have a teacup amnesty. So it was an amnesty

17
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,080
 like where you have to go and turn your teacup in. Yeah, and you won't be arrested. You won't be

18
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,480
 arrested. And you won't be arrested. There was a memo that was sent out that said, "It is regretted

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,680
 that owing to losses, it is no longer possible to provide service crockery for morning and afternoon

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,280
 teas." Wow. And that was all they did at Bletchley. Yeah, they only drank tea. They didn't do any

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,320
 important work at all. No longer providing service crockery for morning and afternoon teas. I feel

22
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,360
 like that's the point at which England really started to decline. Yeah, the start of England's

23
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,120
 decline was the middle of World War II. Is that what we're saying? Yeah. The counterpoint.

24
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,520
 Wasn't the famous thing about Bletchley was that Alan Turing who worked there used to chain his mug

25
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,080
 to the radiator as the story is. And then poor Alan would be teased by people picking the lock

26
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,440
 on the chain and nicking his teacup just to annoy him. If he can't set a code on his lock that's

27
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,080
 not possible to break by the others, then I don't know if I trust this guy to win our war.

28
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,080
 The thing about Turing is I read an interview with someone else who worked at Bletchley,

29
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,560
 and apparently when he wasn't in his office, he used to tie his mug to his hand. So if they go

30
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,640
 outside, there's a big lake at Bletchley, and they'd often have like a picnic out there,

31
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,280
 and he would be there with it tied by rope to his hand so no one could steal it. Fantastic.

32
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,040
 Wasn't there a rumour that they threw crockery into the lake? Do we think that was just a rumour?

33
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,520
 Well, yeah, that's an interesting question. So I found quite a lot of sources, kind of diary

34
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,200
 entries and things like that. So sources or sources. Very good, very good. I went to Bletchley myself

35
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,640
 and dredged the lake and found sources, and I found some sources that people like Josh Cooper,

36
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,680
 who was the really kind of eccentric head of the air section, he would go around the lake,

37
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,000
 finish his coffee and then throw his cup into the lake. And also there's a good reason for

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,400
 Alan Turing to chain his mug up because apparently his deputy, Hugh Alexander, would also be known

39
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,120
 to throw his teacups into the lake. Why? Was there a reason for it? Was it like a celebration or was

40
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,240
 it, oh, we've cracked today's code? They were all Greek. Right, so is it? They would just smash

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,240
 the plates and throw the teacups away. Yeah, it feels like that, doesn't it? Yeah, and well,

42
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,280
 it wasn't just lakes as well. There was another memo that said that they ended up finding loads

43
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,480
 of cups and sources in the shrubs. It feels like there was some kind of weird Easter egg hunt game

44
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,360
 going on that we don't know about. If we know anything, it's that they were good at keeping

45
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,920
 secrets at Bletchley. And I think this one is still Official Secrets Act. Yeah, because

46
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,000
 Liam, you emailed them and asked them if it was true, right? Yeah, well, the thing that was mostly

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,360
 interesting checking was something that said that after the war, the administrators at Bletchley

48
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,960
 dredged the lake, hoping to find kind of discarded equipment that was used to kind of crack the

49
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,680
 enigma code and really fascinating kind of historical artifacts. And instead, all they found

50
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,680
 was giant heaps of cutlery and crockery and resources and stuff, which would have been fantastic.

51
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,000
 So I emailed them just a double check. And I talked to this amazing woman called Heather,

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,240
 hi Heather, if you're listening. And she said that she's always listening. She's actually

53
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,600
 translating what we're saying into three languages simultaneously. Yeah, it's being

54
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,240
 encrypted right now. But she said, unfortunately, they think it's a myth or certainly a bit of an

55
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,120
 exaggeration. But they do know that certainly Josh Cooper may have thrown a cup in once.

56
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,960
 So interesting. Yeah, they're drawing us away from the real story. I think that's it. That's it.

57
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,720
 As I said, maybe actually, it's something very secret to do with the way that we cracked codes

58
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,240
 or fought the war. And they just don't want people to know. Fair enough. Should we say for

59
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,680
 maybe for international listeners? I think we should. Like what Bletchley was. I think I know

60
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,560
 we've been speaking ten minutes. Right. So early 40s, Britain on the ropes. There's a war going on.

61
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,400
 There's a war going on. We're about to go downhill. The tea services declined dramatically.

62
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,160
 The Nazis have overrun Europe. And they are communicating using enigma machines.

63
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,960
 They look like typewriters. And they allow you very easily to to encrypt what you're saying.

64
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,440
 It divides it into blocks of letters. It looks like complete rubbish. And the Germans are so

65
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,400
 confident about the security of enigma, because there are 364 billion possible codes. And there's

66
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,440
 a new code every day. They're so confident they just transmit the messages. They don't try and

67
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,240
 jam the signal or anything. So these messages are out there. And they're undecyparable. There's a

68
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,400
 nightmare. You know, completely impossible. Cocky. And that was their mistake. Because Polish

69
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,960
 intelligence had just cracked enigma just before the war and handed part of the secret, a big part

70
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,680
 of it, to British intelligence. So at Bletchley Park, which is this country estate in England,

71
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,240
 the British government gathers together hundreds and hundreds of codecrackers and administrators

72
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,200
 and people who set to work, including famously Alan Turing, but thousands of people by the end.

73
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,600
 Who do a variety of stuff, right? Famous chess players or people who are great at solving crosswords.

74
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,920
 Yeah. It's an odd collection. Like everyone just sort of piles in to Bletchley Park and start solving

75
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,760
 codes and cracking codes. And it goes on until the war ends. And it's amazingly successful.

76
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,040
 It is. And also the thing about Bletchley, again, that it's famous for here is the fact that it was

77
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,400
 mostly women. So it was a women outnumbered men at Bletchley by about eight to one, I think. And

78
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,800
 they were there doing that mechanical work of every day, taking down all the codes that were coming

79
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,880
 through. Yeah. In fact, I hadn't realized that Baroness Trumpington, who was a real character

80
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,360
 in British politics until she died a few years ago, was at Bletchley. I swear there was a period

81
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,320
 where sort of any elderly posh woman in sort of the nineties when I was growing up had actually

82
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,440
 been at Bletchley at some point. Because also they weren't allowed to say anything, were they?

83
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,400
 So it was like national secrets for so long, so long, so long. And then the nineties came along

84
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,600
 and everything got declassified. And everyone went, oh yeah, I was there. Yeah, so was I. I was.

85
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,440
 Well, they had a whole thing where they were trying to recruit what they called boffins and

86
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,000
 devs, boffins being kind of clever people and devs being debutants, as in high society,

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,640
 socialite women. Oh, why? Because they felt that, you know, they had that kind of level of education.

88
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,200
 And they were often not bilingual. Exactly. They often they could speak French or they could speak

89
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,520
 German or they'd had a university education. And so as you say, it turns out that a lot of the

90
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,600
 people there came from quite high society and then they found themselves, you know, bunking with all

91
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,760
 of these. Yeah. In the class. In Bletchley. Because they were posh, they were often like quite

92
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,160
 eccentric and prone to misbehavior because they could get away with it. So a lot of the women

93
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,240
 would bunk off constantly and go and shag their boyfriends. For instance, there was one woman who

94
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,920
 was in charge called Pamela Rose, who she was actually an actress. She wanted to be in the

95
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,040
 West End. And she was in charge of overseeing 50 women in one of the huts. And one of them was

96
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,760
 actually Baroness Trumpington, who was called Jean Campbell Harris at the time. And at one point

97
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,160
 she had to stuff Baroness Trumpington into a laundry basket and rolled her down the corridor

98
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,280
 into an officer's room, I think, who was quite annoyed, who was trying to do serious work.

99
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,440
 Was that to make her escape? I think it might have been a bit of japery. I'm not sure if it was a

100
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,960
 genuine punishment or having a half. Bad news. Bad news. We've lost another 30,000 troops at C.

101
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,720
 One of the convoys has been sunk by the U-boats, which was due to us not cracking a vital message.

102
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,400
 Good news. We all had a great team building exercise. We've got a laundry basket.

103
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,960
 I think it was amazing. They would, when they turned up, they would be asked two questions.

104
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,000
 One, do you like crossword puzzles? Two, are you engaged to be married? That was your first two

105
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,640
 questions. And then if you said, yes, I like crosswords and no, I'm not engaged, they go,

106
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,000
 okay, now you can have an interview. Oh, you're through. I know also the thing,

107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,520
 the amazing thing about the secrecy is just how secret it was, as in, you don't know what the

108
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,800
 person in the next hut is doing. You don't know what the people in the same room as you were doing.

109
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,480
 So often you don't know what you're doing. I've been in some jobs where I didn't know what I was

110
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,880
 doing. I didn't really know what anyone else was doing. Is it possible you've worked at GCHQ

111
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,440
 without knowing it? That could be true. I thought I was an accountant because it's just numbers.

112
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,240
 Oh my, you've done some significant stuff, I bet, without really. But who?

113
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,000
 Because you're just like cracking these cut and you're grinding through huge numbers of

114
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,160
 huge amounts of information. And Churchill wrote a six volume history of the second reward,

115
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,000
 never mentioned Bletchley, because it was still super, super secret, because they had to hide the

116
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,760
 fact that towards the end of the war, Hitler was an open book. As in, Bletchley Parker were getting

117
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,880
 and translating and deciphering his messages before, like, Rommel or Girl or whatever. That's

118
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,320
 incredible. And then you have to turn, they haven't. Yeah. And the fact that the secrecy lasted for so

119
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,960
 long as well, there are so many veterans who, you know, took the secrets of their graves or

120
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:28,160
 there are amazing stories of, you know, husband and wives who met at Bletchley, but didn't actually

121
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,840
 know what the other person was doing. And then they had kids and they couldn't tell their kids

122
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,200
 what they were doing during the war as well. And so it was just decades and decades and decades

123
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,520
 of secrecy. And what's really fascinating to me is that the first person to kind of publish a book

124
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:49,200
 about what happened at Bletchley was treated as such a traitor by a lot of the veterans who were

125
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,000
 there. It was quite self aggrandizing. It was, you know, kind of like, oh, I did this and I did

126
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,160
 this. That's vital to the war effort and all of this. That was probably another reason he sounded

127
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,640
 like a bit of an arrogant prick. But for a lot of the veterans at Bletchley, it was one of those

128
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,880
 things where it was, you know, it's secret and we're going to take these secrets to our graves.

129
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,200
 Have you guys been there? Yeah. A while ago, actually, I can't remember much about it,

130
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,480
 but that's okay. I was there for a public speaking competition as a teenager. Unfortunately,

131
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,120
 you were engaged to be married, so you could get a job there. Crosswords. That's cool.

132
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,800
 Do you know if you were interviewed there? Another question you might be asked was if you

133
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,240
 were interviewed by Dilly Knox, who was one of the most important people at Bletchley and he was a

134
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,520
 real eccentric. And he would ask people the question, which way round the hands of a clock go?

135
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,480
 Brilliant. What would you say for that? Mark wise.

136
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,840
 You're out. You put the minute hand on first and then the hour hand.

137
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,640
 And then the second hand. You're building a clock.

138
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,400
 Oh, I see you've, you've interpreted it that way. Second hand goes right at the bottom, I think.

139
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,400
 You've thought outside the box, but no, the correct answer according to him is it depends

140
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,520
 whether you're looking at the clock or whether you are the clock. Brilliant.

141
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:08,240
 That's interesting because I imagine no one got that right. So how on earth do we get anyone?

142
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,000
 It sounds a lot like the kind of questions that you think get asked at Oxbridge interviews

143
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,400
 and things like that. And considering that so many people there were from Oxbridge,

144
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,480
 maybe they did kind of think outside the box in that way. I think it was that sort of thing.

145
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,240
 What was the name of the person that you said wanted to be a West End actress?

146
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,480
 That was Pamela Rose. Pamela Rose. So I wonder when Pamela Rose was at Bletchley,

147
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,920
 whether or not she joined the Bletchley Park Dramatic Club.

148
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,080
 She did. She loved it. Yeah, I'm sure she did. I loved reading about this. So at Bletchley,

149
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,720
 it turns out that there was quite a campus-like feel there. A lot of people, you know, their

150
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,480
 university was interrupted by the war and they got recruited by Bletchley. And so,

151
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,760
 one particular veteran described it as being like their university. So there was all the other kind

152
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,000
 of stuff that you'd associate with uni. There was like social clubs. They had Christmas pantos

153
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,600
 that they put on. And he's like, I don't remember any of this at uni. I remember being de-bagged a

154
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:15,040
 lot. You were the one in the laundry basket with me. But one person that I found that I

155
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,920
 thought was so interesting is that Olivia Newton-John's dad, Bryn Newton-John, he was an officer

156
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,240
 at Bletchley and he was a member of the Drama Club. No way, really. He'd find his name Bryn

157
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,600
 Newton-John in all of the programmes for all the shows that they'd put on. Just on the results

158
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,480
 they got. Because it is quite abstract and it's very sort of, you know, there's people like

159
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,920
 poshos in the countryside and actually lots of them weren't posh. Lots of them were Rens,

160
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,920
 women's Royal Naval Service, who were getting on with the like basic work every single day.

161
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,480
 But some of the things they did, for example, they worked out the location of every milk cow

162
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,640
 in the Atlantic Ocean. That's pretty easy. I reckon I could do that now. Not the one on the bottom.

163
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,360
 So the milk cows were the tankers that were in the Atlantic and they were to refuel

164
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,720
 German U-boats. Oh, really? There were, you know, a couple of dozen maximum and they obviously were

165
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,040
 the most significant thing for the entire U-boat operation. They were all located thanks to Enigma

166
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,480
 and they were all sunk. So the U-boat, that was a big part of winning the war against the U-boats.

167
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,600
 I really like one of the ways that they worked. Like you say, the Germans had improved the

168
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,080
 Enigma. So we did know how they worked, but it was still hard to crack the codes every day.

169
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,920
 And so what you needed was some information that you knew. So when they sent the information,

170
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,560
 you know what you're looking for. And so what they did was they would drop bombs in very obvious

171
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,520
 places and they drop in a place where you know exactly where it is. And so the Germans then

172
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:49,520
 would send a message saying there's been a bomb in, you know, 25 miles north of Dresden or something.

173
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,560
 And you know what 25 miles north of Dresden is. And you know, probably might even by then know

174
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,200
 that you're looking for the word "Meinen", which is German for a mine or a bomb. So you would know

175
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,000
 what you're looking for. And it's called "Gardening". I think this is the kind of thing where we're like,

176
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,360
 that's so clever. And if you were one of the actual code breakers listening, you'd be like,

177
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,720
 God, that's the most basic thing. Wow. Can I give you something on crockery and throwing

178
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,400
 crockery around? So this fact was perhaps about people throwing crockery. So I thought I'd look

179
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,960
 at plate smashing in Greece. I've seen various articles about where it comes from. And some

180
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,440
 people say, oh, it's an ancient Greek thing that they would do in funerals. I'm not really so sure.

181
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:38,000
 I think it might be quite a modern thing that came in the 1960s and 70s. But actually in 1969,

182
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,440
 it was banned by the military dictator, Georgeus Papadopoulos. He banned any plate smashing in

183
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,240
 Greece because it was so dangerous. Oh, not because we didn't have enough crockery for

184
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:57,760
 art and tea anymore. No, because they set up these factories where you would make fake crockery.

185
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,000
 Amazing. So it was like, it was real crockery. It was made of china and stuff, but it was like

186
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,760
 really low quality. There was no patterns on it, anything like that. It was just something that

187
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:12,960
 was made deliberately so you could then smash it. And there were 53 manufacturers of these fake

188
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:19,680
 plates in Thessaloniki alone. Stop it! Yeah, honestly. Very good. How many plates were being

189
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,760
 smashed? There was in the 60s up to 100,000 per month, it's estimated. Why? At the end of your

190
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,520
 meal, if you've got a great restaurant, they'll smash the plates for you. It's just like a

191
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,960
 tradition. They'll smash it for you. You don't even get to do the smashing. Well, you used to do it

192
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,560
 yourself and then like health and safety came in and you would get like some waiters would,

193
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,080
 you know, put on their glasses so that they don't get any peace in their eyes and do it.

194
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,320
 They'd actually take them away for the controlled explosion.

195
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:53,280
 And today there's only one manufacturer of fake plates in the whole of Thessaloniki.

196
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,800
 That was actually what we remember when the Greeks had the terrible recession around the time of the

197
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,800
 credit crunch. That was mostly caused by the fake plate industry, wasn't it? Yeah. But like,

198
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,320
 what is a fake plate? Is in what's a fake plate? It's interesting because you could still use them

199
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,520
 as a plate. Absolutely. But they're much cheaper to manufacture. They're not bothered if there's

200
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,520
 cracks in there or anything like that. There's no patterns on there. They're just white

201
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,920
 china plates. Not as fun to smash, though. I bet there were proper hardcore smashes who still went

202
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,720
 for the sort of £100 property there. Yeah. Do you still go to the, to the museum in Athens?

203
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,880
 Is this why we're not giving the Parthenon marbles back? Do you think they're going to be used to

204
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,280
 this sort of smash orgy? I don't know if you've seen the Elgi marbles, but they are quite smashed

205
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,360
 orgy. Well, why do you think they got like that in the first place?

206
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:52,240
 Okay, it's time for fact number two. And that's my fact. My fact is that 18th century sea captains

207
00:17:52,240 --> 00:18:00,400
 sometimes use their sailors as sails. Brilliant. This is actually in a book called See People

208
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,800
 by a woman called Christina Thompson, and it's such a good book. It's so fantastically written.

209
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:11,200
 And this is a practice called Manning the Four Shrouds. And it was used throughout kind of the

210
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,000
 great age of sail, which I suppose was 15th century to 19th century, a long period. And basically,

211
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,920
 if the wind is too high, if there's a big gale, if there's a storm, then it's very dangerous to put

212
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,040
 your sails up because they could be completely shredded. The mask could be toppled. The boat's

213
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,720
 going to be there. Oh, yeah. You don't want to get any of your sails shredded instead. Put one of

214
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:35,680
 your men up there. We've got 400 sailors and only one big sail. No, that makes sense.

215
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:42,240
 Send up Stanley Big Shirt. Is that a reference to my friend? Yeah. That's very good because we've

216
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,680
 never mentioned him on here. Probably. I don't think so. You used to have a friend whose nickname

217
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,880
 was Stanley Big Shirt. That's so good because it worked for the listener, and then it worked

218
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,520
 even better for James on a higher level. Thank you. So this is where the captain of a ship would

219
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,720
 say to Stanley Big Shirt and Co, "Could you please climb up onto the Four Shrouds?" So the

220
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,960
 shrouds of a ship are, if you see a big sailing ship, there's what look like, you know, like a salt

221
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,240
 coarse rope platters and climbing frames. Yeah, rigging frames kind of thing. Yeah, exactly. That

222
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,080
 rigging is what the shrouds are, and they're what support the masks, and you can climb up them really

223
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,240
 easily. So the sailors would all climb up, and they'd spread out their hands and legs, and they'd

224
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,560
 literally just face up against the wind. Just sounds like utter nonsense, doesn't it? So they'd need

225
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:33,120
 a density of sailors such that it was the solid wall of sailors. Yeah. That's a lot of sailors.

226
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,320
 Well, it's a lot of sailors. So it's kind of holding, can't it, and still be pretty functional,

227
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,400
 but you get most of the effect. I think that was because you didn't want it to be too strong. That

228
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,200
 was the thing. They're not going to be as strong as a sail, but there was one. There was a ship

229
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,080
 captain by Sir Hyde Parker in the 1700s, where 200 sailors were sent up into the rigging. The one

230
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,040
 that Christina Thompson in her book refers to is Commodore George Anson, who was involved in the

231
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,840
 War of Jenkins-Ear, which I think we must have mentioned. I don't think we have. And again,

232
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,680
 for international listeners, this was a huge deal for Britain, the War of Jenkins-Ear. I actually

233
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:07,600
 think the British listeners, the War of Jenkins-Ear is, I don't think it's GCSE syllabus.

234
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,440
 It was about 70, no, I'm thinking of the Seven Years' War. Sorry, no, disregard that. That was

235
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,240
 a bigger deal. I would say it goes World War II, World War I, War of Jenkins-Ear are the three main

236
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,200
 things on the syllabus in English schools, certainly. And basically, there's a War of Jenkins-Ear in

237
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,440
 1740, which was named after a humorous slam in Parliament, where someone waved an ear around,

238
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,960
 Google it. I thought it was someone. I thought it was someone.

239
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,560
 It faded a little. Jenkins-Ear got cut off in a naval fracar.

240
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,680
 I thought it did. Didn't the cut off ear get waved around? I think I might have made up

241
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,040
 that bit. I've embellished it in my head. Yeah. I don't think you allow props in the

242
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,480
 hands of Parliament. That's their rule. You're right.

243
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,360
 That's why they've had to remove the official rubber chicken from Parliament.

244
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,400
 It's really said they're an out-of-the-sector, and that's the one prop they have here.

245
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,040
 Anyway, this captain recorded in his diary in 1740 that we dared not venture any sail abroad,

246
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,520
 so instead we had to put the helm of weather, as in, I think, face the helm towards the wind

247
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,720
 and man the four shrouds. And in kind of classic 1700s understatement, he recorded,

248
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,880
 "It proved successful for the end intended, although one of our best men did go overboard."

249
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,600
 Wow. So, yeah, good trick.

250
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,040
 Feels like a rare move. Yeah, it must have been. They might have been doing it often.

251
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,440
 I would say it was what we might call a life hack. It came up a bit. I was reading in a...

252
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,160
 In Captain's Weekly. These 12 weird tricks. You won't believe number eight.

253
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:35,440
 I think it was... Silas, hate him. But, like, was that the only thing they used the sailors for?

254
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,960
 Could you have used one as an oar, for instance? Lovely. Yeah.

255
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,600
 Your tallest, straightest soldier could be used. Bigster Tony. Yeah, exactly, yeah.

256
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:50,640
 I didn't... You could look into that, because they did sometimes. I read one thing in an 1810

257
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,120
 book of sailing instructions that said, "If you're in a gale, you either man the four shrouds,

258
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,880
 or if you've got some spare canvas or hammocks," which, I guess, the sailors are desperately

259
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,240
 struggling for hammocks at this point to get up there instead. If you've got some hammocks,

260
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,880
 you put them up there instead. Yeah. Well, that did actually happen once with the

261
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,400
 hammocks. But in the 1920s, so that was a good, what, 200 years after? They were still using

262
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,520
 random hammocks and blankets and things. So why were they doing that? Yeah, so there was a US

263
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,800
 submarine that ran out of fuel and lost communications. A sail not very useful in the submarine, I would say.

264
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,240
 What? What? You would think. You would think. There should be a milk cow around here somewhere.

265
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,080
 We'll be actually taking them all out at that point. They thought, "How are we going to get home?"

266
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:39,200
 And so the commanding officer basically commanded his men to grab the hammocks and grab the blankets

267
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:47,760
 and grab the bunk bed frames. And they built masts and sails and put them on their submarine

268
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,000
 and sailed their submarine home. That is so cool. Because submarines weren't mostly surface vessels,

269
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,440
 weren't they, in the '10s and '20s? Were they? Well, they just called Marines then.

270
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,080
 Well, they couldn't go down for long, could they? They could, like, early proto-submarines.

271
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,080
 Did everyone on board have to hold their breath?

272
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:11,280
 Age of sail stuff is so, is so cool. I just, I really, really like all of it. So I got some

273
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,440
 nautical slang for you. The manning the foreshadows thing, I thought. This is to a

274
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,640
 guide to nautical slang from John Hard. And it was published only about 30 years ago. So it's

275
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:26,400
 got some more modern stuff. "Bronzy bronzy". It's where you conferred in a battle. That's right.

276
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,880
 Really bad result. Cold and silver. And you're like, "Ah, bad news. We got bronzy bronzy this time."

277
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,880
 You didn't even lose. No, that's suntanned, if you're suntanned.

278
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:44,240
 Bunch of bastards. The French. Always correct. But it's also some tangled rope.

279
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:53,200
 Bunghole. Ah, no. Is it the Agnes? The newest recruit always had to,

280
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,280
 it was part of the initiation ceremony, wasn't it? Bunghole. No, that's just some cheese.

281
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,960
 What? Cheese. Is it, do they use the cheese sometimes to bung up holes?

282
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,240
 Yeah, maybe. So it's just, bunghole is cheese. Do you know what a nip cheese was? Oh, no.

283
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,200
 This was in a book called The Sailor's Word book, an alphabetical digest of nautical terms,

284
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,440
 which is a very, very old. Nip cheese. Nip cheese. So I'm imagining it's not a kind of cheese.

285
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,200
 Is it just mice on boats? Oh, that's a great one. No, it's not quite that.

286
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:28,480
 We ain't got any ideas. Oh, I mean, yes, but... I'm not sure.

287
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,600
 Is it a nipple thing? No, it's not an Andy. Well, quite, as if, like, you guys are parents,

288
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,680
 you've heard of like neck cheese, right? Oh, as in they get stuck in the folds.

289
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,280
 Yeah, you know, like, you know, kind of when a baby's breastfeeding and then

290
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,520
 the breast milk kind of dribbles down and then kind of gets stuck in the folds of their neck.

291
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,280
 Yeah, yeah. It's never got to a cheese like status, I have to say, in my experience. I've

292
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,280
 never been able to ferment it properly. But despite your best efforts, is it?

293
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,040
 Oh, yeah. I love any cheese. No, it's not the same as that, but on the nipples.

294
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,480
 It's the name for a purse's steward. So the person who looks after the money,

295
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,280
 if you imagine, like, cutting bits of cheese to kind of share the money.

296
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,200
 He's like cheese pairing. Yeah, exactly like that. Stingy. Yeah, yeah.

297
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,960
 Do you know why we call a poop deck a poop deck? Everyone shouts on it.

298
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,440
 I don't know. Everyone shouts on it. That's what they did with it. Yeah. What's a poop deck?

299
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,240
 Well, a particular deck on the ship, not the main deck. The back. Well, there's the four deck,

300
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,880
 there's the main deck and I don't know where the poop deck is actually. Well, if you knew that,

301
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,960
 it might give you a clue. Is it at the back? It's on the stern and it comes from the French

302
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:41,360
 la poop, which means the stern. Love the boat. And for that reason, you have some other things.

303
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:48,160
 You have the pooping sea and that is where you're going down the sea and the current is going at

304
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:54,000
 the same speed as your stern. So your rudder can't really get any purchase because you're

305
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,760
 going at the same speed as the water. That's great. Do you know what a bunting tosser is?

306
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,920
 Someone from the Jubilee. Is it? That's right.

307
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:08,240
 Actually, you're dead on. Oh, have I? Well, it kind of, it is flag-related.

308
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,520
 It's a radio operator and that would traditionally have been a signalman

309
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,840
 who has is raising the signal flags and so bunting tosser. That's exactly what I said.

310
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:29,520
 Snorkers. Just sausages guys. Just sausages. Oh, okay. And the beach master. The beach master.

311
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:35,680
 He was someone who stood on the beach and said, "This way guys. This way. Keep going. Keep going.

312
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,720
 Keep going. Oh, too far. Too far. Oh, shit. Do you know what? I'm going to give you that.

313
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,480
 Well, and again, this is going to be something completely different.

314
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,920
 Did he have those kind of like ping pong bats? That's it. Yeah. It's a superior officer who is

315
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:53,600
 appointed to lead the storming party. The beach master. So yeah. Do you remember we talked two

316
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:01,760
 weeks ago about elephant seals? They're beach masters. Our heaps of jubia. Is there ever been

317
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,360
 a situation where an elephant seal beach master and the British naval beach master have been

318
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:14,000
 mixed up with hilarious consequences? Dozens. Oh, no. The storming party is just one

319
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,480
 elephant seal with his harem of a hundred females. That's great. I mean, you would run away, wouldn't

320
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:25,440
 you? Yeah. Scary. This is sort of relates back to the Bletchleef Act, but there was a Cornish

321
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,640
 pirate called Robert Culliford, and he once loaded their cannons with China crockery in the hope that

322
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,200
 it would tear the sails of the opposition ships. That's a great idea, didn't it? How'd that work?

323
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,160
 It did not work well. They actually exploded into a fine powder by the time they had met the enemy

324
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:49,760
 sails. So just rained down. Nice bit of rain. Yes. I think they also, they did that in the

325
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:57,120
 Trojan War, didn't they? And that's why Greek people, to this day, smash plates at the end of a meal.

326
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,320
 Have you heard of the pine tree riot? This is a thing that pretty much prompted the American War

327
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,920
 of Independence and was directly related to the navy. Okay. Well, was it tax related? Yes.

328
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:13,760
 Just getting it all right. I mean, actually, you have got it right. Yeah. So basically,

329
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:19,440
 Britain and France both wanted to build ships and to build a ship with a big mast, you need a big

330
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,920
 tree. I got this, by the way, from a brilliant book called The Age of Wood, which is such a

331
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:29,600
 good book. You thought it was something different, didn't you? Britain had very little forest at this

332
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,480
 time, partly because it's kind of all into ships, and had to get them from America, because in America

333
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,880
 there are these gorgeous massive pine trees that will make a cracking mast. Yeah. And they had all

334
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,440
 sorts of trouble. They basically decreed, right, all trees over 24 inches across, which is what you

335
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,000
 need for a ship mast. They belong to the Crown, and we mark them with a little arrow and their

336
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,960
 hours, and you can't have them, you colonists. And in fact, having wide floorboards was a sign that

337
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,280
 you were a patriotic American colonist that you were just cocking a snook at the British,

338
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,200
 because you had used these wide trees. Nice. Rather than glowing the British up.

339
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:09,520
 You rebel you with your wide floorboards. And this all led to this confrontation where the British

340
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,680
 sent the authorities to try and say, look, these really are our trees, and the Americans kind of

341
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,800
 sent them away with their tail between their legs and embarrassed them and humiliated them.

342
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,280
 And this was a thing called the Pine Tree Riot, and that was 1772, and that pretty much led

343
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:28,400
 on to the Boston Tea Party, 1773, and from there, you know, everything went downhill.

344
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:36,080
 Yeah, but that was like, that was mostly mast related. Interesting. Yeah. The age of wood,

345
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:42,720
 by the way, just count the rigs, that'll do it. Fantastic. James, we did spend a 300 paid contract

346
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,560
 with the British. I was looking a bit into what sails are made out of. And nowadays,

347
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:56,000
 they can be all sorts from natural fibers like cotton and blacks to synthetic fibers like nylon,

348
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,280
 polyester, all of that. But one thing I found that was quite interesting to me was that hemp

349
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:07,920
 was used basically throughout the ship for everything. So hemp oil was used in the lamps,

350
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,840
 the sailors would wear clothing made out of hemp, the ship's logs would be written on hemp paper.

351
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,560
 But it turns out that some of these massive sailing ships, they would actually carry hemp

352
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:24,560
 seeds with them so that if they ended up in a shipwreck or they had damage, they could plant the

353
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:31,520
 seeds to grow hemp. Grow your ship! And then mend their rope or their canvas, because hemp is one

354
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:37,840
 of the fastest growing plants on earth. That's fantastic. That's really cool. And they would use

355
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:46,240
 hemp to make the canvas for the sails and the ropes. And the word canvas actually comes from

356
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:54,080
 the word cannabis. Get away! It's good. Which is the same plant as hemp. Which is, yeah. For any

357
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,440
 squares listening. Sorry, just quick mention of the old wacky-backy.

358
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:10,640
 Okay, we should move on to fact number three. And that is Andy.

359
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,160
 My fact is that reindeer can chew in their sleep. Oh, that's useful. It's so cool.

360
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,440
 Gavaskorn must do a good business in the reindeer community, wasn't it?

361
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,280
 So it's really clever. It's all to do with where they live because they live in the very high regions

362
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:34,080
 of the earth. Not necessarily higher, I would say. I mean further north. Not like on top of Everest.

363
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,880
 Okay, we're being squares about it. This is why you never travel north of Watford. You're like,

364
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,240
 "Oh, I'm so higher." I can't get the oxygen. Okay, they live in the Arctic Circle. We're being

365
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,680
 like, "Do we be?" Yeah, sure. And obviously the light there changes a lot, doesn't it? So some

366
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,400
 of the year, it's always light. Some of the year, it's never light. It's dark for ages.

367
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:00,240
 And they have a very, very weak body clock. So in summer, they have to eat a great deal all the

368
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,520
 time to gain weight to survive the winter. And they're ruminants, so they bring food back up

369
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,640
 from one of their stomachs and they keep chewing it. And because they're having to do a lot of this

370
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,320
 during the summer, they will regurgitate food and they will keep chewing it while they're asleep.

371
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,680
 We weren't sure before what they were doing. They just look a bit dazed and a bit

372
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,720
 dozy. And the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research have measured their brainwaves while

373
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,120
 they're doing this, standing around chewing. And it sounds like they are in a light stage of sleep

374
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,960
 while they're eating. That's brilliant. Wait, we couldn't tell if they were asleep. Do they not

375
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,440
 have their eyes closed? I think brain activity is a better guide, isn't it, than whether you've got

376
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,200
 your eyes closed. It's not like every time you close your eyes, you're asleep. No, I know. I just

377
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,040
 feel like I'd know if I just looked at the reindeer. You'd be like, "Well, they're obviously asleep."

378
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,560
 You've just fell asleep for a second there.

379
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:54,160
 That thing is really interesting about the body clocks because it means they don't get jet-lagged,

380
00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:00,960
 right? So our body clock is 24 hours. We deal with the light, the dark, we're on a 24-hour clock.

381
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,120
 If we go through some time zones, then we're not on 24 hours anymore and we're all over the place.

382
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:14,080
 But if reindeers would do regular flights to Australia, like they might do once a year

383
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,000
 to deliver presents, for instance, they wouldn't get jet-lagged. And the interesting thing about

384
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,280
 that is, you know, there are gene variants that cause this and maybe we can turn those genes on

385
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,920
 and off in humans one day to stop humans from getting jet-lagged. That feels like a drastic

386
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:38,560
 intervention for jet lag. Yeah, we would also grow horns. Yeah, reindeer. Reindeer are cool,

387
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,680
 aren't they? Most of my facts are about the Sami people who are obsessed with reindeer.

388
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,040
 But, well, I say obsessed. Obsessed with, usually, reliant on them for their survival.

389
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,920
 Guys, get over there. Obsessed with oxygen and water.

390
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:57,200
 No, I love the Sami people. They are the people who live up in the Arctic Circle, really,

391
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,880
 in the northern parts of Norway and Sweden and Finland. The high places of the earth.

392
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,160
 The high places, yes. So they paid their taxes in live reindeer for a long time. They have special

393
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:11,840
 designations sort of in the sort of equivalent of the Magna Carta of that region. So it's called

394
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,720
 the Lap Kodassil and it was a clause added to the 1751 Treaty which designated the borders of all

395
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,120
 those countries. And it said that they are allowed to move totally freely across borders because the

396
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,840
 reindeer need to move across borders and they need to herd them. Although herding reindeer is

397
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,320
 basically just following them, I think. Oh, really? The reindeer go where they want to find

398
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,800
 food to get sustenance to go to better climates and the Sami people just follow them to make sure

399
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,600
 they keep. That is mostly true. You can get them to go in the direction you want. And the way you

400
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:45,280
 do that is you piss in a bottle and you carry it around with you and if they start going in the

401
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,280
 direction you don't want them to go in, you pour a little bit in this direction and they all go,

402
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,160
 "Oh, piss lovely" and they all walk towards where the piss smell is because it's like got salt and

403
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:01,520
 minerals and stuff like that. Oh, just a life hack, we call that. Good to know. Anyway, they have over

404
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,440
 a thousand words for reindeer and they really do because reindeer are so important. So they have

405
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,360
 like a liami, which means a short fat female reindeer. They have a snari, a reindeer whose

406
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,880
 antlers are short and branched. A nijiru is an unmanageable female. And they're a bit sexist

407
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,040
 these names, aren't they? There's no room for your woke political niceties in the unforgiving

408
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,960
 tundra, James. Well, there's a lot of snowflakes up there I have heard.

409
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:40,240
 That's cool. They do have a word for a bull with one testicle. So maybe the feminist reindeer are

410
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,440
 getting upset and cutting off the testicles of the males. They have night vision goggles,

411
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:53,680
 effectively, inside their eyes. Reindeer. So reindeer's eyes change colour over the season.

412
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,800
 So they're golden in summer and then they're blue in the winter. And the reason that's helpful

413
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,520
 is that in winter they can see a lot more UV light. And the reason that UV light is helpful

414
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,960
 is that their favourite food is this thing called reindeer moss. Disappointingly, it's a kind of

415
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,080
 lichen. But it's really yummy and it's very nutritious and there's a lot of it about in the

416
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,440
 Arctic. So reindeer love it and they like to find it. And it's impossible for a human to find it

417
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,280
 because it's pale. But to a reindeer it's incredibly obvious where the patches of reindeer moss are

418
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,840
 because it looks a completely different colour to them. Because I think snow gives off UV light,

419
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,800
 doesn't it? Whereas it doesn't. So it looks like dark because they have this ability to see the UV

420
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,440
 light. They can see what the moss is. So it's very, very cool. They're very well adapted for their

421
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,560
 environment. What's interesting is that they're not actually 100% sure how the eyeball actually

422
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,960
 changes from golden to blue. And we should say as well actually that the colour changes not in your

423
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,640
 iris. No, because otherwise it sounds insane that they've discovered this in like 2030. It's like

424
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,040
 wait a minute, we've domesticated these guys for how long? We've not looked at their eyes? So yeah,

425
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,600
 it's not that you're looking at them on the outside and their eye colour changes. It's the inside.

426
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,400
 It's the thing called the tappatum lucidum, I think I'm saying that correctly,

427
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,560
 which is kind of on the back of the eye and it does all of the reflecting of the light

428
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,400
 around your eye. Well, you would see that, I reckon, is if you were taking a photo of a load

429
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,280
 of reindeer and one of them looked directly at the flash, I reckon you would see the changes over

430
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,200
 there. Is that right? Yeah, that's why if you photograph animals in the dark, yeah, that's their

431
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,120
 tappatum lucidum. Because that's why we get red eyes is because the back of our eyes is red,

432
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:36,480
 because it's got a lot of blood in there. And so when the flash goes, you see the light goes into

433
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,800
 the back of your eye where all the blood vessels are. And that's why you get red eyes. Is that why

434
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,840
 you get red eyes? In old, like mostly in old, is it from film photos? Do you get that on digital

435
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:51,040
 photos now? I've seen newer photos, yeah. Do you? Yeah, yeah. I've never done that. So that doesn't

436
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,800
 point that no one had ever taken a photograph of a reindeer. I've never taken it with flash, at least.

437
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,960
 I think it's quite hard to take a photo of reindeer with flash. They're very camera shy, aren't they?

438
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,280
 Well, they have a very shiny nose. Oh, your nose has come out red in this one and this one.

439
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,120
 I didn't know the UK has reindeer. I was incredibly excited to find that out.

440
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:21,280
 There's one wild herd of reindeer and they're at the Cairngorm reindeer centre, but they are wild.

441
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,400
 It's not a zoo or an enclosure. They're not penned. High up. Very high up, near Inverness. I mean,

442
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,000
 probably in the top of the mountains because it's the Cairngorms I was thinking as opposed to.

443
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,480
 Well, that too. And they were introduced by this great couple, Mikkel Utsi and his wife,

444
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,280
 Dr Ethel Lindgren in 1952, probably overshadowed by the change of monarchy and the Everest

445
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,120
 expedition. But still, and they gave them all these furious reasons of why we could, because

446
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,680
 it's basically early rewilding, you know, just by any other name. And the reasons they gave these

447
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,520
 two scientists, they said, well, great source of meat, great source of fur, useful for military

448
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,560
 transport in case of the Cold War turning hot. Sure. I saw that and I couldn't work out what,

449
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,200
 did they imagine that they would be bringing the reindeer to the Soviet Union and using them to

450
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,360
 transport stuff like military equipment or maybe are we being invaded? Nuclear winter,

451
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:15,520
 maybe. And so we get a load of snow. They might be useful. There was a story in the Russian press

452
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:22,560
 in the, when was this? It was in the 2000s that criminals like gangs were using reindeer to do

453
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,080
 their crimes. And the reason being that they were in Siberia. So the police are coming to get them.

454
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,240
 And the police had snowmobiles, but the reindeer were quicker than the snowmobiles.

455
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,720
 And so the criminals realised that and they would use them to...

456
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,160
 Is there like getaway vehicle? Yeah, yeah, getaway. Cool.

457
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,560
 Would they ride them? No, they'd be pulled on sleighs. Yeah.

458
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,920
 Doesn't sound weird, these got-nick-russian criminals being pulled by...

459
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,440
 And children running to them.

460
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,840
 Well, if you've just robbed a bank, though, you've probably got sacks of money waiting on the back

461
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,840
 of the sleigh. Yeah. And one will fall off. Maybe that's the origin of the Santa Claus myth.

462
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,680
 But the Kengor reindeer-centred staff, very excitingly, they did a naked calendar just

463
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,800
 a few years ago. Naked humans or naked reindeer? Naked the reindeer, I think,

464
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,320
 were mostly in harnesses and things. They didn't shave them all. They all died of cold.

465
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:23,040
 No, but there were 17 herders and they're all posing in the hall together to raise money for

466
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,440
 the Kengor mountain rescue team. Did we approve of this? I mean, like, I don't mind

467
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,600
 that group of what were they, Women's Institute people doing it the first time.

468
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:38,080
 You've repeatedly turned down my idea, James, for a fish nude calendar where we're all hiding behind

469
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:44,080
 facts. But this trend of people doing this? Well, I'll just give you a line from the

470
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:50,000
 photographer who said... Who said, "It's very cold in the Kengars."

471
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,560
 Taking pictures of my naked friends and colleagues, not to mention my girlfriend's mum

472
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,840
 was certainly a surreal experience. I can't believe they fell for it, who said?

473
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:10,160
 She goes from town to town posing naked calendars. It's really nice to hear for a

474
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:17,840
 perfect scam, isn't it? Just go to another office. Hello! I'm just wondering if you like a naked

475
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:29,520
 calendar or a cherry. Oh, I want a dark film, "Canada Girls" because I can't put that lens on it.

476
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:37,680
 Oh, dear. Good gracious. More stuff on reindeer, guys. They are very fast. The robbers are right.

477
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,680
 And they're fast and very young. They can outrun an Olympic sprinter when they're only a day old.

478
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,360
 Stop it. That's so cool. What? Newborns can stand and walk almost straight away,

479
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,400
 and then within an hour, they can run. That is very good. Which is good. It makes me wonder if

480
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,120
 they do that competition within 15 minutes. Some parents are like, "Mine's actually running already."

481
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:06,000
 You should get Santa's reindeer to be your financial advisors.

482
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,720
 Because they're not employed for the rest of the year. Very nice.

483
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,320
 Or they're free in January for the tax deadline. Exactly. They're twiddling their hooves otherwise.

484
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:22,240
 So what it is is that a team of researchers at Dartmouth College, bearing in mind this is an

485
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,000
 Ivy League University, right? They did a very, very serious study where they got a bunch of

486
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,760
 Santa's reindeer at a local kind of Christmas theme park. They were Dasha, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet,

487
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,040
 Cupid, Donna, Blitz and Rudolph, and Boris. Boris was a trainee.

488
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,080
 Can I just ask, are these real reindeer, and are they really Santa's reindeer?

489
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:52,640
 They are real reindeer, and Santa is real. Okay, cool. So they're living reindeer. It wasn't like,

490
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,120
 "Mod, okay, right?" And what they did was they laid out copies of the Wall Street Journal's stock

491
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:03,600
 pages on the floor of their barn, and they got them to select stocks that they wanted them to buy.

492
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:08,080
 So they made hoof prints on the newspaper pages, and then they went and purchased these stocks to

493
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:16,000
 create a reindeer portfolio. And they found that it outdid the S&P 500, which is the kind of top

494
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,880
 500 companies in the US. It outdid the growth of those companies by 5%. And apparently, that's

495
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:29,760
 statistically significant. What? Is it? Is it apparently so? There's the Ivy League researchers.

496
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,320
 But the thing that they did... Sorry, just to say, that is significant. If you could make 5% more

497
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,960
 than the average on the stock market, and you could consistently do that, then you'd be very

498
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,520
 rich. Yeah, you'd be doing well. That's the consistently thing, isn't it? Well, all we have is

499
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,000
 evidence that they are consistent. No, over six months. But the reason why they did this was

500
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,560
 kind of to prove that senators and congressmen, who are often in America accused of using their

501
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:02,400
 inside knowledge to play the stock market, that what they did was they compared the portfolios

502
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,800
 of the senators to the reindeer portfolio and found that the reindeer was still better than the

503
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,000
 senators and the congressmen who had inside knowledge. And one of the researchers actually said

504
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,520
 that it turns out that these politicians are as feckless as the rest of us at stock pickings.

505
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,560
 Well, it could be that they're scrupulously honest, and they don't use any of their internal

506
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,160
 knowledge. Very, very good point. Very good point. And maybe they prove that with the reindeer

507
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,280
 portfolio. Or it could be reindeers are absolutely massive inside of it. They're going around the

508
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,880
 country once a year, like while Santas delivering the presents, they're hecking into emails. They go

509
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,800
 through the filing cabinet. Yeah, they always take a bite out of the apple, drink the sherry,

510
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,200
 and go through all of your books. Why are there hoof prints left inside the house after he's been?

511
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,320
 It doesn't make any sense. No, you're so right. Do they fall down the chimney? This should be on

512
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:55,120
 the roof. Yeah, who found the roof. That's a good title for a children's book. Lovely. Don't

513
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,720
 give your reindeer's carrots. Why not? I don't know any reindeers. Next question. No, I'm listening.

514
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,440
 I do. Yeah. Well, just because we were saying about, you know, sherry and Ms. Pisces, I mean,

515
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,320
 don't give them them either. But yeah, they can't digest them. But what am I going to cover my penis

516
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:17,920
 with in the naked calendar? Maybe there's some other baby vegetables that they make. I don't know.

517
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,360
 Let's see if I can find a runner bean.

518
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:34,000
 Great stuff. Okay. All right, it's time to pee. Do you want to go now?

519
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,440
 A pee's not going to be big enough.

520
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,680
 Okay, it is time for our final fact this week, and that is James. Okay,

521
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:58,640
 my fact this week is that from 1841 to 1851, the MP for thirst thought he was a bird.

522
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,640
 He was then replaced by a man who was later killed by a turnip.

523
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:08,960
 Was he killed by an actual turnip or another MP who thought he was a turnip?

524
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,760
 He was killed by an actual turnip. Did it get into the campaign literature?

525
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,520
 Vote for me. The other guy thinks he's a bird.

526
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,600
 I'm safe around turnips.

527
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:24,160
 There wasn't much in the way of campaigning in these days, especially in thirst.

528
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:30,000
 All of these people all got in without any opponents. Who do you want to hear about first?

529
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,640
 The bird of the bird man, I think. Okay, the bird man of thirst was a guy called John Bell.

530
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,000
 Basically, in this area, they had to have an MP. They had a railway and there were a few people

531
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,320
 living there. They had to have an MP, and there wasn't really anyone to do it. A few people from

532
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,880
 outside of the town came in. They might want to do it, but no one in the town wanted to vote for

533
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,520
 them. So they all voted for this guy called John Bell because his family owned half of the houses

534
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,400
 in the town, and everyone liked them. He was the right man for the job, really.

535
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,520
 So they voted for him, but after he'd been in there for a little while, it turned out that he

536
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:15,200
 was of unsound mind, and they did an inquiry as to his unsoundness of mind, which took place at

537
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:21,040
 the three tons hotel in thirst, which is now a Weatherspoons. In this inquiry, they said that

538
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,080
 he sometimes fancied himself to be an eagle and made motions with his arms as if endeavouring

539
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:31,280
 to raise himself from the ground to fly. He was also convinced that someone was trying to poison

540
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:38,720
 him with iodine in his tea. A bit of a callback to the last episode, iodine. And then on other

541
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,480
 occasions, when in company, he would forget that he was at the dinner table and start to undress

542
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,640
 himself. But in those days, there was no way to get rid of someone. If they were an MP and there

543
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,960
 wasn't an election, and even if there was an election and people there wanted to send back

544
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,400
 the same guy, there's no way to get rid of them if they were of unsound mind. I guess I don't even

545
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,120
 know how you would now, because in fact, then legislation was introduced, and then there were

546
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,920
 various upgrades to it. But I think it was all repealed in about 2012 or 13. So, you know...

547
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,080
 I can't imagine any of our politicians would be of unsound mind.

548
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,640
 You're right. It's just not relevant anymore. And anyway, he unfortunately died.

549
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,040
 Was he an honest MP, by the way, or was he feathering his own nest?

550
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,880
 Very good. Thank you. Any more of that?

551
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,920
 No, no, no. I just had that one stored up and I didn't want it to sit around inside me.

552
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,600
 I can't wait for your turnip pun that's upcoming. Because he was replaced by a guy called Sir

553
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:40,640
 William Payne Galway, and he was out shooting in the parish, and he walked across a turnip field,

554
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,760
 and he fell with his body onto a turnip. I'm quoting from the York Herald here.

555
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,560
 He fell with his body onto a turnip, sustaining severe internal injuries.

556
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,480
 No, that's a fake excuse when you're talking to the hospital, isn't it?

557
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,120
 And in the Hoover, I just kicked him when the vacuum was on.

558
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:03,840
 He was nakedly shooting in a field, and he fell and the turnip went up his arse.

559
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:11,520
 No, he fell on the turnip and injured himself, and the next day he failed to recover.

560
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:17,520
 And turnips are not funny things to fall onto. They're big serious. They're big hard things, you know.

561
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,800
 I mean, turnips are inherently funny, I think. Sorry. I don't know why I said that,

562
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,280
 but they're not really funny. He wasn't the only MP who died in a turnip-related incident.

563
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,360
 I don't know if you guys found the story of Lewis Fenton, the wig MP for Huddersfield.

564
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:37,280
 So he died a little earlier than this. This was 1833, about 50 years before,

565
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,560
 and he fell out of a window at home. Very sadly, he died of his injuries,

566
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:45,200
 you know, tragic, and his widow explained that he was in the habit of going up to the attic

567
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,440
 to look out of the window at a piece of ground where his turnips were growing.

568
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,000
 Oh, yeah.

569
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,880
 To make sure that the cows had not, also his cows, had not got into the turnip enclosure,

570
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,320
 and were not, you know, yet.

571
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,520
 So when he'd disappear for hours at a time, he'd be like, "No, darling, you know,

572
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,680
 I'm watching the turnips. I promise I'm watching the turnips."

573
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,440
 Some strange noises come out of the attic. No, no, that's my turnip watching.

574
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,800
 I don't think we're going to imply anything unsavory about a turnip.

575
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,440
 The band's dead, well, he should be, you know, and he probably just was looking so much that

576
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,960
 he overbalanced and tipped out of the window. Must have been, must have been, yeah.

577
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,160
 I was just, just the word for the mental disorder that you have when you think you are,

578
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,400
 let's say, a bird is clinical lycanthropy, which I just looked up and I was wondering

579
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,440
 whether it was a thing.

580
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,480
 Like a werewolf.

581
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,320
 I think lycanthropy must be werewolf.

582
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,280
 It comes from the idea of, yeah, exactly, being like a wolf,

583
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,200
 but it applies to thinking you're like any animal.

584
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,960
 I guess they couldn't be asked to come up with a different word for thinking you're like.

585
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,840
 You were thinking it would be zotropy or something.

586
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,200
 Yeah, I get, but it must be more common to think you're a wolf.

587
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,360
 But I just, I like the Wikipedia page on clinical lycanthropy

588
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:51,840
 just because it used the case history of a 25 year old man who was sent for treatment

589
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,440
 during a period of excessive hand washing, irritable behaviour, decreased sleep,

590
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,800
 and acting like a buffalo.

591
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,480
 Buffaloes famously obsessively wash their hands.

592
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:02,960
 They do.

593
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,240
 No, that's a bison.

594
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,720
 Brilliant, there we go. Brilliant.

595
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,480
 That's a bucket list joke.

596
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,920
 That was one.

597
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,560
 I got that from a Christmas cracker 25 years ago and I've been trying to, she hold it in.

598
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,720
 Oh my god.

599
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:27,280
 The MP's page on Wikipedia for notable MPs with records in various directions

600
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,320
 is unbelievably good.

601
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,360
 I don't know who's written that, but it's...

602
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,040
 What do you mean records in directions?

603
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,480
 So here's one.

604
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,800
 The youngest MP ever in the House of Commons in England.

605
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,120
 Oh yeah.

606
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,640
 Christopher Monk who was elected MP for Devon aged 13.

607
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,840
 Yeah.

608
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,120
 How old did he become a monk?

609
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:41,760
 That's the question.

610
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,120
 Brilliant.

611
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,320
 You know the interesting thing about Christopher Monk?

612
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,880
 I haven't seen that page, but I do have him in my notes.

613
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,600
 Fantastic.

614
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:56,160
 And he in 1681 arranged a boxing match between his butler and his butcher,

615
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,800
 which is the first recorded boxing match in England.

616
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,560
 That's really good.

617
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,920
 Yeah, 1681.

618
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,520
 He's a real man of the people as well, wasn't he?

619
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:09,600
 And the butcher won, we know, but we don't know much more about that.

620
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,120
 He had a big right hook, didn't he?

621
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,240
 Yeah, I like it.

622
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,120
 Nice.

623
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,160
 Thank you.

624
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,280
 They're all coming out tonight.

625
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:15,680
 Oh yeah.

626
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,560
 Wow.

627
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,280
 But the oldest MP, Samuel Young, are on a list.

628
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,120
 No, that's brilliant.

629
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,120
 Served until he was 96 years old.

630
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,640
 Really impressive.

631
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,240
 How old was Baroness Trumpington when she died?

632
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,840
 She was really old.

633
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,680
 She was in the Lords, and I think most people in the Lords are at least 90, aren't they?

634
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,840
 But you know, Parliament wasn't for a long time, it was very unofficial,

635
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,400
 but you know, it was local landowners, and then it was Barons,

636
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,360
 and then as they gradually extended the right to vote to more people,

637
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,480
 they gradually thought, "Probably can't be only Baroness.

638
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,360
 We've got it in the house of Trump."

639
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:49,760
 Whatever.

640
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,520
 Yeah, yeah.

641
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,920
 I liked George Sitwell, who's actually Edith Sitwell, the poet's dad,

642
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,800
 but he was an MP in the 1880s and 90s, MP for Scarborough,

643
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,440
 and he was just a fun guy.

644
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,640
 He spent his time writing books.

645
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,400
 He wrote books on pig keeping in the 13th century, lepers squints.

646
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,600
 Acorns is an article of medieval diet and the history of the fork.

647
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,840
 Lepers squints.

648
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,960
 Yeah, wrote a book.

649
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,160
 I don't think he got these books published.

650
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,280
 He sounds very much like a QI researcher.

651
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,320
 Yeah, he really does.

652
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,480
 Researching random topics of his own interest.

653
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,160
 He does, and actually, very creative as well, as we all have to be,

654
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,280
 because he invented a musical toothbrush that played a song while you cleaned your teeth.

655
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,000
 That is good.

656
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,480
 That's good.

657
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,600
 This one in the 1880s.

658
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,080
 Yeah.

659
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:38,320
 He also invented a mini gun for shooting wasps, and the Sitwell egg.

660
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:43,760
 It was nothing, you know, you didn't sit on it.

661
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,680
 It wasn't a Gwyneth Paltrow kind of freak.

662
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,240
 You're sitting well.

663
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,280
 Tell me about it.

664
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,240
 Got the egg up there.

665
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,480
 No, it was made of smoked meat, which was the yolk,

666
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,880
 and then it was wrapped in the white, which was rice,

667
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,480
 and then a synthetic shell around it, and he tried to sell it into his self-ridges.

668
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,280
 So he was trying to have a new Scotch egg, basically.

669
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,680
 But we go stock with rice, did you say?

670
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,320
 With rice, exactly.

671
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,120
 Well, that's like an umu subi, like the kind of Japanese one.

672
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,400
 Yes, I was actually going to say sushi,

673
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,880
 but it sounds like you've said the proper thing that it is.

674
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,120
 Apparently, when he went to self-ridges,

675
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,680
 he walked into the front door and said,

676
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,960
 "I am Sir George Sitwell, and I brought my egg with me."

677
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,080
 Hello, dragons.

678
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:38,320
 I love Ignatius Timothy Trebich Lincoln.

679
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,440
 So do I.

680
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,920
 Another man of the people judging by his name, clearly.

681
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,640
 But he had the most insane CV of anybody I have ever heard of.

682
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,160
 So he was born in Hungary to an Orthodox Jewish family.

683
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,160
 He was a student rabbi, but then he became wanted for petty theft.

684
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,720
 So he fled to London, he became a Christian,

685
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,840
 and then he went to Canada as a Presbyterian missionary,

686
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,640
 and then he went back to England as an Anglican curate,

687
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,000
 and then he was an MP for Darlington in 1910.

688
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,680
 He ran out of money, so he stopped being an MP.

689
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,240
 He became a speculator in Romanian oil,

690
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,120
 a German continental spy in World War I,

691
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,680
 and then a munition merchant in China.

692
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,840
 And then he converted to Buddhism, became a monk,

693
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,480
 and then tried to become a Nazi collaborator.

694
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,520
 That all sounds very tiring.

695
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,720
 He could have just been a liar.

696
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,400
 And then you could do all that stuff.

697
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,240
 That's true, but the absolute cherry on the cake for me is that

698
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,720
 he made contact with the Nazis, right?

699
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,320
 Because he said to him, "Listen,

700
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,560
 I have declared myself the Dalai Lama."

701
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:47,200
 And I am backed by the Japanese.

702
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,600
 The Tibetans were less keen on this idea,

703
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,560
 but the Japanese were like,

704
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:54,560
 "Yeah, this random Hungarian Jewish Christian MP guy,

705
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,160
 he can be our Dalai Lama."

706
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,600
 And he said, "I can help you lead a Buddhist uprising

707
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,600
 in the East for the Nazis."

708
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,640
 That's a great alternative history of the war.

709
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,120
 Right.

710
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,920
 Did they go for it?

711
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,280
 Unfortunately, they didn't, sadly.

712
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,240
 Sadly.

713
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,080
 Sadly, the Nazis did the war.

714
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,280
 But how amazing would history would have been

715
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,040
 if the Hungarian Dalai Lama?

716
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,160
 Good grief.

717
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,960
 The names are incredible.

718
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,160
 What's he called it? Ignatius?

719
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,160
 Ignatius Timothy Trebuch Lincoln.

720
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,480
 They do have just good...

721
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,640
 I don't know whether it's like minor aristocracy

722
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,960
 who are the kind of people who wear MPs in the 17th century,

723
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,960
 but Sir Freshville Hollars.

724
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,840
 Lovely.

725
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,320
 Grimsby.

726
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,600
 I was looking at MPs who'd been injured in the line of...

727
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,680
 Not the line of duty, actually, just in their lives in general,

728
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,240
 because there were lots who'd lost arms in sea battles,

729
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,840
 as Sir Freshville did.

730
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,800
 Sackville Tufton was wounded in the Battle of Schuenevelt.

731
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:49,280
 Brooke Watson lost his right leg to a shark in Havana in 1749.

732
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,600
 I mean, these guys had really interesting careers.

733
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,880
 What's he doing there?

734
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,520
 Sailing around.

735
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,840
 He was being used as an ore, wasn't he?

736
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:00,080
 John Stubbs, I love this.

737
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:00,960
 This is a really interesting one.

738
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,240
 He was the MP for Great Yarmouth.

739
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,200
 He lost a hand for distributing a pamphlet

740
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,320
 in 1579.

741
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,440
 What, to a lion?

742
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,240
 Oh, to a pamphlet.

743
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:08,800
 Paper cut.

744
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,920
 Bad paper cut.

745
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,120
 His pamphlet was titled,

746
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,680
 "The discovery of a gaping gulf where unto England

747
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,080
 is like to be swallowed by another French marriage

748
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,160
 if the Lord forbid not the bans."

749
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,840
 And it was arguing that Queen Elizabeth

750
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,600
 was too old to have children,

751
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,800
 and she should therefore not marry the Duke of Anjou,

752
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,080
 who was a French prince,

753
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,480
 and he was sentenced to death.

754
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,880
 And then that was commuted to losing a hand.

755
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,720
 And then just before it happened,

756
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,000
 he said, "Pray for me now.

757
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,520
 My calamity is at hand."

758
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,880
 Oh, yeah.

759
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,680
 Oh, funny.

760
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,360
 It's just nice of a pun to go before...

761
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,240
 It should have had a podcast.

762
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,000
 He would have loved my bison gel, Gary.

763
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,480
 Speaking of excellent names,

764
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,920
 just a very quick one here for you.

765
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,320
 The Labour MP for Brockstow from 1929 to 1953

766
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,920
 was called Seymour Cox.

767
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,520
 Brilliant.

768
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,080
 Wow.

769
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,120
 Brilliant.

770
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,880
 Can't believe I've never heard of him.

771
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,520
 I mean, as if you're not going to cross next to his name.

772
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,280
 You don't need to come after Seymour, do you?

773
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,840
 Seymour Cox.

774
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,360
 Yeah, that was his name.

775
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,720
 It was also his campaign slogan.

776
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:16,000
 But that's like a name that Bart would ring up most bar with.

777
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,720
 Seymour Cox.

778
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,360
 I don't know what x-rated Simpsons you've been watching.

779
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:26,480
 Wow.

780
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,600
 Seymour Cox.

781
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,080
 Um, just one more said the MP.

782
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,840
 Or, except for MP.

783
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,320
 Yeah.

784
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,080
 Um, God, it's so hard to choose.

785
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,760
 There have been so many, but I do like John Mitten,

786
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,240
 who was a Tory MP in 1819.

787
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,560
 Not for very long, because he found it really boring.

788
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,040
 But he just did lots of fun stuff.

789
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,240
 He once rode a horse into a hotel in Leamington Spa

790
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,880
 and rode it up the grand staircase in the middle

791
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,080
 onto a balcony and then jumped it down from the balcony

792
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,520
 over the diners in the restaurant below

793
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,880
 and out through the window.

794
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,840
 If you're rich and a man here, a middle class,

795
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,920
 you could be a cuck for me.

796
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,520
 I don't even think it was middle class, to be honest.

797
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,520
 He was very, very, very...

798
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,480
 He would hunt a lot and like to do it naked.

799
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,920
 Sometimes he'd start to hunt clothes

800
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,440
 and then apparently get so excited mid-hunt

801
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,800
 that he'd strip off all his clothes

802
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,080
 and then arrive back naked.

803
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,960
 And in winter as well, so quite hardy,

804
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,600
 then he hunted ducks on a frozen lake naked as well.

805
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,840
 He liked animals, I don't know if that ingrates you.

806
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,360
 It doesn't sound like he did,

807
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,840
 because he was hunting all the time.

808
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,200
 He liked very specific animals.

809
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,240
 I love animals.

810
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,760
 I love shooting them.

811
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,800
 I love hunting them.

812
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,360
 Much like a lot of people who like hunting

813
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,560
 and killing certain animals.

814
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,880
 He loved other animals, like his horse,

815
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,800
 who he used to nap with by the fireplace

816
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,480
 and who lived inside his house with him.

817
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,160
 He's one of these people who...

818
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,280
 The stories are incredible

819
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,640
 and you think he would have been a nightmare

820
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,840
 to have in your extended family

821
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,520
 because it's always Mad Jack Mittens turned up

822
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,880
 and done something wacky again.

823
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,800
 And I think he died in poverty, in debt,

824
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,720
 in prison at the age of about 30.

825
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

826
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,680
 Am I allowed to say good?

827
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,320
 Well, yeah, you can tell what you like.

828
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,560
 Yeah, he was a very eccentric dude.

829
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,760
 He was, he loved being naked.

830
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,800
 That's not eccentric.

831
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,000
 No, it's illegal.

832
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,120
 It's not illegal.

833
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,320
 It's actually only illegal

834
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,400
 if you're causing hard-walled distress or intending to.

835
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,480
 Sorry, you don't need to justify yourself to me.

836
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,720
 And that very well-positioned baby carrot

837
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,800
 saves your blushes anyway.

838
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,320
 My calendar, it's not a company one.

839
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,120
 It's just, this is actually legal calendar, 2024.

840
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,680
 I'm not intending a larval distress.

841
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,440
 And if you feel it, that's on you.

842
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,320
 Well, I apologise if.

843
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,360
 Sorry about the way you feel calendar.

844
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:45,440
 Okay, that's all of our facts

845
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,120
 and thank you so much for listening.

846
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,560
 We'll be back again next week

847
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,840
 with another episode.

848
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,640
 In the meantime, you can get in touch with any of us

849
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,320
 on various social media accounts.

850
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,360
 James.

851
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,840
 I'm on Twitter @JamesHarken.

852
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,240
 Andy.

853
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,120
 @AndrewHunterM.

854
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,640
 Liam.

855
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,760
 I'm not on anything.

856
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,760
 Good on you, me neither.

857
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,240
 But if you want to get in touch with a lot of us,

858
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,320
 you can email podcast.qi.com

859
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,800
 or you can tweet @NoSuchThing.

860
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,160
 Or feel free to go to our website

861
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,000
 where you can get all our episodes

862
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,320
 and links to various other things that we do.

863
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,640
 That's no such thing as a fish.com.

864
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,440
 That will also give you a link to Club Fish,

865
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,680
 which is our special secret society,

866
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,240
 subscriber society where we put all of our good content.

867
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,400
 I think it's where you can buy Andy's new calendar, isn't it?

868
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:30,960
 Certainly is.

869
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,000
 You actually get someone whether you want to or not.

870
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,160
 You have to pay extra not to get the calendar.

871
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:41,120
 And other than that,

872
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,640
 please join us again next week for another episode.

873
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,680
 Thank you so much for listening.

874
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,120
 We'll see you again.

875
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:47,760
 Goodbye.
