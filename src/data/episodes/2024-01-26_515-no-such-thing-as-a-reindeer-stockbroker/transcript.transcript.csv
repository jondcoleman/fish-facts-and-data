00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. Dan Shriver is"
00:00:06,00:00:13,"not with us today, unfortunately. He is off doing community service. By which I mean he's"
00:00:13,00:00:18,"doing jury duty, which means he won't be here this week or next. But in his place, we are"
00:00:18,00:00:26,"joined by our colleague and very, very good friend, Liying Li. Now, some of you, the Super"
00:00:26,00:00:33,"Duper Fish fans, will already know who Liying is. She has appeared on our Meet the Elves feature in"
00:00:33,00:00:39,Club Fish. She was so good on that that we decided to ask her onto the main podcast. I'm sure you're
00:00:39,00:00:43,"going to really enjoy it. She's absolutely brilliant. If you want to know more about all the other elves,"
00:00:43,00:00:50,"then go to nosuchthingsafish.com/apple and nosuchthingsafish.com/patreon. And if you go there,"
00:00:50,00:00:54,"you can hear all the other episodes of Meet the Elves, as well as Drop As Aligned, which is our"
00:00:54,00:01:00,"mailbag show, compilations, and much, much more. Anyway, there's not much more to say today, apart"
00:01:00,00:01:04,from really hope you enjoy the show with Liying. And on with the podcast!
00:01:21,00:01:26,"Hello, and welcome to No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI"
00:01:26,00:01:31,"offices in Hoban. My name is Anna Tyshinski, and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter"
00:01:31,00:01:36,"Murray, and Liying Li, and we are gathered here today with our four favourite facts from the last"
00:01:36,00:01:43,"seven days. So in no particular order, here we go. Liying, what's your fact? My fact this week is"
00:01:43,00:01:50,"that during World War II, Bletchley Park was forced to have a teacup amnesty. So it was an amnesty"
00:01:50,00:01:54,"like where you have to go and turn your teacup in. Yeah, and you won't be arrested. You won't be"
00:01:54,00:01:58,"arrested. And you won't be arrested. There was a memo that was sent out that said, ""It is regretted"
00:01:58,00:02:03,"that owing to losses, it is no longer possible to provide service crockery for morning and afternoon"
00:02:03,00:02:09,"teas."" Wow. And that was all they did at Bletchley. Yeah, they only drank tea. They didn't do any"
00:02:09,00:02:14,important work at all. No longer providing service crockery for morning and afternoon teas. I feel
00:02:14,00:02:19,"like that's the point at which England really started to decline. Yeah, the start of England's"
00:02:19,00:02:25,decline was the middle of World War II. Is that what we're saying? Yeah. The counterpoint.
00:02:25,00:02:31,Wasn't the famous thing about Bletchley was that Alan Turing who worked there used to chain his mug
00:02:31,00:02:38,to the radiator as the story is. And then poor Alan would be teased by people picking the lock
00:02:38,00:02:45,on the chain and nicking his teacup just to annoy him. If he can't set a code on his lock that's
00:02:45,00:02:50,"not possible to break by the others, then I don't know if I trust this guy to win our war."
00:02:50,00:02:56,"The thing about Turing is I read an interview with someone else who worked at Bletchley,"
00:02:56,00:03:00,"and apparently when he wasn't in his office, he used to tie his mug to his hand. So if they go"
00:03:00,00:03:04,"outside, there's a big lake at Bletchley, and they'd often have like a picnic out there,"
00:03:04,00:03:09,and he would be there with it tied by rope to his hand so no one could steal it. Fantastic.
00:03:09,00:03:13,Wasn't there a rumour that they threw crockery into the lake? Do we think that was just a rumour?
00:03:13,00:03:19,"Well, yeah, that's an interesting question. So I found quite a lot of sources, kind of diary"
00:03:19,00:03:25,"entries and things like that. So sources or sources. Very good, very good. I went to Bletchley myself"
00:03:25,00:03:32,"and dredged the lake and found sources, and I found some sources that people like Josh Cooper,"
00:03:32,00:03:37,"who was the really kind of eccentric head of the air section, he would go around the lake,"
00:03:37,00:03:44,finish his coffee and then throw his cup into the lake. And also there's a good reason for
00:03:44,00:03:50,"Alan Turing to chain his mug up because apparently his deputy, Hugh Alexander, would also be known"
00:03:50,00:03:55,to throw his teacups into the lake. Why? Was there a reason for it? Was it like a celebration or was
00:03:55,00:04:00,"it, oh, we've cracked today's code? They were all Greek. Right, so is it? They would just smash"
00:04:00,00:04:04,"the plates and throw the teacups away. Yeah, it feels like that, doesn't it? Yeah, and well,"
00:04:04,00:04:09,it wasn't just lakes as well. There was another memo that said that they ended up finding loads
00:04:09,00:04:16,of cups and sources in the shrubs. It feels like there was some kind of weird Easter egg hunt game
00:04:16,00:04:19,"going on that we don't know about. If we know anything, it's that they were good at keeping"
00:04:19,00:04:23,"secrets at Bletchley. And I think this one is still Official Secrets Act. Yeah, because"
00:04:23,00:04:28,"Liam, you emailed them and asked them if it was true, right? Yeah, well, the thing that was mostly"
00:04:28,00:04:33,"interesting checking was something that said that after the war, the administrators at Bletchley"
00:04:33,00:04:38,"dredged the lake, hoping to find kind of discarded equipment that was used to kind of crack the"
00:04:38,00:04:43,"enigma code and really fascinating kind of historical artifacts. And instead, all they found"
00:04:43,00:04:49,"was giant heaps of cutlery and crockery and resources and stuff, which would have been fantastic."
00:04:49,00:04:54,"So I emailed them just a double check. And I talked to this amazing woman called Heather,"
00:04:54,00:05:00,"hi Heather, if you're listening. And she said that she's always listening. She's actually"
00:05:00,00:05:03,"translating what we're saying into three languages simultaneously. Yeah, it's being"
00:05:03,00:05:10,"encrypted right now. But she said, unfortunately, they think it's a myth or certainly a bit of an"
00:05:10,00:05:17,exaggeration. But they do know that certainly Josh Cooper may have thrown a cup in once.
00:05:17,00:05:24,"So interesting. Yeah, they're drawing us away from the real story. I think that's it. That's it."
00:05:24,00:05:30,"As I said, maybe actually, it's something very secret to do with the way that we cracked codes"
00:05:30,00:05:34,or fought the war. And they just don't want people to know. Fair enough. Should we say for
00:05:34,00:05:37,maybe for international listeners? I think we should. Like what Bletchley was. I think I know
00:05:37,00:05:42,"we've been speaking ten minutes. Right. So early 40s, Britain on the ropes. There's a war going on."
00:05:42,00:05:48,There's a war going on. We're about to go downhill. The tea services declined dramatically.
00:05:48,00:05:54,The Nazis have overrun Europe. And they are communicating using enigma machines.
00:05:54,00:05:58,They look like typewriters. And they allow you very easily to to encrypt what you're saying.
00:05:58,00:06:03,It divides it into blocks of letters. It looks like complete rubbish. And the Germans are so
00:06:03,00:06:08,"confident about the security of enigma, because there are 364 billion possible codes. And there's"
00:06:08,00:06:13,a new code every day. They're so confident they just transmit the messages. They don't try and
00:06:13,00:06:18,jam the signal or anything. So these messages are out there. And they're undecyparable. There's a
00:06:18,00:06:24,"nightmare. You know, completely impossible. Cocky. And that was their mistake. Because Polish"
00:06:24,00:06:28,"intelligence had just cracked enigma just before the war and handed part of the secret, a big part"
00:06:28,00:06:33,"of it, to British intelligence. So at Bletchley Park, which is this country estate in England,"
00:06:33,00:06:38,the British government gathers together hundreds and hundreds of codecrackers and administrators
00:06:38,00:06:43,"and people who set to work, including famously Alan Turing, but thousands of people by the end."
00:06:43,00:06:47,"Who do a variety of stuff, right? Famous chess players or people who are great at solving crosswords."
00:06:47,00:06:51,Yeah. It's an odd collection. Like everyone just sort of piles in to Bletchley Park and start solving
00:06:51,00:06:55,codes and cracking codes. And it goes on until the war ends. And it's amazingly successful.
00:06:55,00:07:01,"It is. And also the thing about Bletchley, again, that it's famous for here is the fact that it was"
00:07:01,00:07:06,"mostly women. So it was a women outnumbered men at Bletchley by about eight to one, I think. And"
00:07:06,00:07:10,"they were there doing that mechanical work of every day, taking down all the codes that were coming"
00:07:10,00:07:16,"through. Yeah. In fact, I hadn't realized that Baroness Trumpington, who was a real character"
00:07:16,00:07:21,"in British politics until she died a few years ago, was at Bletchley. I swear there was a period"
00:07:21,00:07:26,where sort of any elderly posh woman in sort of the nineties when I was growing up had actually
00:07:26,00:07:29,"been at Bletchley at some point. Because also they weren't allowed to say anything, were they?"
00:07:29,00:07:34,"So it was like national secrets for so long, so long, so long. And then the nineties came along"
00:07:34,00:07:39,"and everything got declassified. And everyone went, oh yeah, I was there. Yeah, so was I. I was."
00:07:39,00:07:43,"Well, they had a whole thing where they were trying to recruit what they called boffins and"
00:07:43,00:07:50,"devs, boffins being kind of clever people and devs being debutants, as in high society,"
00:07:50,00:07:56,"socialite women. Oh, why? Because they felt that, you know, they had that kind of level of education."
00:07:56,00:08:01,And they were often not bilingual. Exactly. They often they could speak French or they could speak
00:08:01,00:08:05,"German or they'd had a university education. And so as you say, it turns out that a lot of the"
00:08:05,00:08:11,"people there came from quite high society and then they found themselves, you know, bunking with all"
00:08:11,00:08:15,"of these. Yeah. In the class. In Bletchley. Because they were posh, they were often like quite"
00:08:15,00:08:20,eccentric and prone to misbehavior because they could get away with it. So a lot of the women
00:08:20,00:08:24,"would bunk off constantly and go and shag their boyfriends. For instance, there was one woman who"
00:08:24,00:08:27,"was in charge called Pamela Rose, who she was actually an actress. She wanted to be in the"
00:08:27,00:08:33,West End. And she was in charge of overseeing 50 women in one of the huts. And one of them was
00:08:33,00:08:37,"actually Baroness Trumpington, who was called Jean Campbell Harris at the time. And at one point"
00:08:37,00:08:42,she had to stuff Baroness Trumpington into a laundry basket and rolled her down the corridor
00:08:42,00:08:47,"into an officer's room, I think, who was quite annoyed, who was trying to do serious work."
00:08:47,00:08:51,Was that to make her escape? I think it might have been a bit of japery. I'm not sure if it was a
00:08:51,00:08:56,"genuine punishment or having a half. Bad news. Bad news. We've lost another 30,000 troops at C."
00:08:56,00:09:00,"One of the convoys has been sunk by the U-boats, which was due to us not cracking a vital message."
00:09:00,00:09:04,Good news. We all had a great team building exercise. We've got a laundry basket.
00:09:04,00:09:08,"I think it was amazing. They would, when they turned up, they would be asked two questions."
00:09:08,00:09:14,"One, do you like crossword puzzles? Two, are you engaged to be married? That was your first two"
00:09:14,00:09:18,"questions. And then if you said, yes, I like crosswords and no, I'm not engaged, they go,"
00:09:18,00:09:24,"okay, now you can have an interview. Oh, you're through. I know also the thing,"
00:09:24,00:09:27,"the amazing thing about the secrecy is just how secret it was, as in, you don't know what the"
00:09:27,00:09:30,person in the next hut is doing. You don't know what the people in the same room as you were doing.
00:09:30,00:09:36,So often you don't know what you're doing. I've been in some jobs where I didn't know what I was
00:09:36,00:09:40,doing. I didn't really know what anyone else was doing. Is it possible you've worked at GCHQ
00:09:40,00:09:45,without knowing it? That could be true. I thought I was an accountant because it's just numbers.
00:09:45,00:09:50,"Oh my, you've done some significant stuff, I bet, without really. But who?"
00:09:50,00:09:56,Because you're just like cracking these cut and you're grinding through huge numbers of
00:09:56,00:10:00,"huge amounts of information. And Churchill wrote a six volume history of the second reward,"
00:10:00,00:10:04,"never mentioned Bletchley, because it was still super, super secret, because they had to hide the"
00:10:04,00:10:07,"fact that towards the end of the war, Hitler was an open book. As in, Bletchley Parker were getting"
00:10:07,00:10:12,"and translating and deciphering his messages before, like, Rommel or Girl or whatever. That's"
00:10:12,00:10:18,"incredible. And then you have to turn, they haven't. Yeah. And the fact that the secrecy lasted for so"
00:10:18,00:10:22,"long as well, there are so many veterans who, you know, took the secrets of their graves or"
00:10:22,00:10:28,"there are amazing stories of, you know, husband and wives who met at Bletchley, but didn't actually"
00:10:28,00:10:31,know what the other person was doing. And then they had kids and they couldn't tell their kids
00:10:31,00:10:37,what they were doing during the war as well. And so it was just decades and decades and decades
00:10:37,00:10:43,of secrecy. And what's really fascinating to me is that the first person to kind of publish a book
00:10:43,00:10:49,about what happened at Bletchley was treated as such a traitor by a lot of the veterans who were
00:10:49,00:10:54,"there. It was quite self aggrandizing. It was, you know, kind of like, oh, I did this and I did"
00:10:54,00:10:58,this. That's vital to the war effort and all of this. That was probably another reason he sounded
00:10:58,00:11:02,"like a bit of an arrogant prick. But for a lot of the veterans at Bletchley, it was one of those"
00:11:02,00:11:06,"things where it was, you know, it's secret and we're going to take these secrets to our graves."
00:11:06,00:11:11,"Have you guys been there? Yeah. A while ago, actually, I can't remember much about it,"
00:11:11,00:11:16,"but that's okay. I was there for a public speaking competition as a teenager. Unfortunately,"
00:11:16,00:11:23,"you were engaged to be married, so you could get a job there. Crosswords. That's cool."
00:11:23,00:11:26,Do you know if you were interviewed there? Another question you might be asked was if you
00:11:26,00:11:32,"were interviewed by Dilly Knox, who was one of the most important people at Bletchley and he was a"
00:11:32,00:11:39,"real eccentric. And he would ask people the question, which way round the hands of a clock go?"
00:11:39,00:11:42,Brilliant. What would you say for that? Mark wise.
00:11:42,00:11:47,You're out. You put the minute hand on first and then the hour hand.
00:11:47,00:11:50,And then the second hand. You're building a clock.
00:11:50,00:11:54,"Oh, I see you've, you've interpreted it that way. Second hand goes right at the bottom, I think."
00:11:54,00:11:58,"You've thought outside the box, but no, the correct answer according to him is it depends"
00:11:58,00:12:01,whether you're looking at the clock or whether you are the clock. Brilliant.
00:12:01,00:12:08,That's interesting because I imagine no one got that right. So how on earth do we get anyone?
00:12:08,00:12:14,It sounds a lot like the kind of questions that you think get asked at Oxbridge interviews
00:12:14,00:12:18,"and things like that. And considering that so many people there were from Oxbridge,"
00:12:18,00:12:22,maybe they did kind of think outside the box in that way. I think it was that sort of thing.
00:12:22,00:12:26,What was the name of the person that you said wanted to be a West End actress?
00:12:26,00:12:30,"That was Pamela Rose. Pamela Rose. So I wonder when Pamela Rose was at Bletchley,"
00:12:30,00:12:33,whether or not she joined the Bletchley Park Dramatic Club.
00:12:33,00:12:40,"She did. She loved it. Yeah, I'm sure she did. I loved reading about this. So at Bletchley,"
00:12:40,00:12:44,"it turns out that there was quite a campus-like feel there. A lot of people, you know, their"
00:12:44,00:12:50,"university was interrupted by the war and they got recruited by Bletchley. And so,"
00:12:50,00:12:55,one particular veteran described it as being like their university. So there was all the other kind
00:12:55,00:13:02,of stuff that you'd associate with uni. There was like social clubs. They had Christmas pantos
00:13:02,00:13:07,"that they put on. And he's like, I don't remember any of this at uni. I remember being de-bagged a"
00:13:07,00:13:15,lot. You were the one in the laundry basket with me. But one person that I found that I
00:13:15,00:13:21,"thought was so interesting is that Olivia Newton-John's dad, Bryn Newton-John, he was an officer"
00:13:21,00:13:28,"at Bletchley and he was a member of the Drama Club. No way, really. He'd find his name Bryn"
00:13:28,00:13:33,Newton-John in all of the programmes for all the shows that they'd put on. Just on the results
00:13:33,00:13:38,"they got. Because it is quite abstract and it's very sort of, you know, there's people like"
00:13:38,00:13:41,"poshos in the countryside and actually lots of them weren't posh. Lots of them were Rens,"
00:13:41,00:13:45,"women's Royal Naval Service, who were getting on with the like basic work every single day."
00:13:45,00:13:50,"But some of the things they did, for example, they worked out the location of every milk cow"
00:13:50,00:13:56,in the Atlantic Ocean. That's pretty easy. I reckon I could do that now. Not the one on the bottom.
00:14:00,00:14:05,So the milk cows were the tankers that were in the Atlantic and they were to refuel
00:14:05,00:14:10,"German U-boats. Oh, really? There were, you know, a couple of dozen maximum and they obviously were"
00:14:10,00:14:15,the most significant thing for the entire U-boat operation. They were all located thanks to Enigma
00:14:15,00:14:18,"and they were all sunk. So the U-boat, that was a big part of winning the war against the U-boats."
00:14:18,00:14:23,"I really like one of the ways that they worked. Like you say, the Germans had improved the"
00:14:23,00:14:28,"Enigma. So we did know how they worked, but it was still hard to crack the codes every day."
00:14:28,00:14:33,"And so what you needed was some information that you knew. So when they sent the information,"
00:14:33,00:14:38,you know what you're looking for. And so what they did was they would drop bombs in very obvious
00:14:38,00:14:43,places and they drop in a place where you know exactly where it is. And so the Germans then
00:14:43,00:14:49,"would send a message saying there's been a bomb in, you know, 25 miles north of Dresden or something."
00:14:49,00:14:54,"And you know what 25 miles north of Dresden is. And you know, probably might even by then know"
00:14:54,00:14:59,"that you're looking for the word ""Meinen"", which is German for a mine or a bomb. So you would know"
00:14:59,00:15:04,"what you're looking for. And it's called ""Gardening"". I think this is the kind of thing where we're like,"
00:15:04,00:15:07,"that's so clever. And if you were one of the actual code breakers listening, you'd be like,"
00:15:07,00:15:14,"God, that's the most basic thing. Wow. Can I give you something on crockery and throwing"
00:15:14,00:15:20,crockery around? So this fact was perhaps about people throwing crockery. So I thought I'd look
00:15:20,00:15:26,at plate smashing in Greece. I've seen various articles about where it comes from. And some
00:15:26,00:15:31,"people say, oh, it's an ancient Greek thing that they would do in funerals. I'm not really so sure."
00:15:31,00:15:38,"I think it might be quite a modern thing that came in the 1960s and 70s. But actually in 1969,"
00:15:38,00:15:45,"it was banned by the military dictator, Georgeus Papadopoulos. He banned any plate smashing in"
00:15:45,00:15:50,"Greece because it was so dangerous. Oh, not because we didn't have enough crockery for"
00:15:50,00:15:57,"art and tea anymore. No, because they set up these factories where you would make fake crockery."
00:15:57,00:16:02,"Amazing. So it was like, it was real crockery. It was made of china and stuff, but it was like"
00:16:02,00:16:05,"really low quality. There was no patterns on it, anything like that. It was just something that"
00:16:05,00:16:12,was made deliberately so you could then smash it. And there were 53 manufacturers of these fake
00:16:12,00:16:19,"plates in Thessaloniki alone. Stop it! Yeah, honestly. Very good. How many plates were being"
00:16:19,00:16:27,"smashed? There was in the 60s up to 100,000 per month, it's estimated. Why? At the end of your"
00:16:27,00:16:31,"meal, if you've got a great restaurant, they'll smash the plates for you. It's just like a"
00:16:31,00:16:34,"tradition. They'll smash it for you. You don't even get to do the smashing. Well, you used to do it"
00:16:34,00:16:40,"yourself and then like health and safety came in and you would get like some waiters would,"
00:16:40,00:16:44,"you know, put on their glasses so that they don't get any peace in their eyes and do it."
00:16:44,00:16:46,They'd actually take them away for the controlled explosion.
00:16:46,00:16:53,And today there's only one manufacturer of fake plates in the whole of Thessaloniki.
00:16:53,00:16:58,That was actually what we remember when the Greeks had the terrible recession around the time of the
00:16:58,00:17:02,"credit crunch. That was mostly caused by the fake plate industry, wasn't it? Yeah. But like,"
00:17:02,00:17:06,what is a fake plate? Is in what's a fake plate? It's interesting because you could still use them
00:17:06,00:17:11,as a plate. Absolutely. But they're much cheaper to manufacture. They're not bothered if there's
00:17:11,00:17:15,cracks in there or anything like that. There's no patterns on there. They're just white
00:17:15,00:17:19,"china plates. Not as fun to smash, though. I bet there were proper hardcore smashes who still went"
00:17:19,00:17:24,"for the sort of £100 property there. Yeah. Do you still go to the, to the museum in Athens?"
00:17:24,00:17:30,Is this why we're not giving the Parthenon marbles back? Do you think they're going to be used to
00:17:30,00:17:37,"this sort of smash orgy? I don't know if you've seen the Elgi marbles, but they are quite smashed"
00:17:37,00:17:41,"orgy. Well, why do you think they got like that in the first place?"
00:17:41,00:17:52,"Okay, it's time for fact number two. And that's my fact. My fact is that 18th century sea captains"
00:17:52,00:18:00,sometimes use their sailors as sails. Brilliant. This is actually in a book called See People
00:18:00,00:18:04,"by a woman called Christina Thompson, and it's such a good book. It's so fantastically written."
00:18:04,00:18:11,And this is a practice called Manning the Four Shrouds. And it was used throughout kind of the
00:18:11,00:18:16,"great age of sail, which I suppose was 15th century to 19th century, a long period. And basically,"
00:18:16,00:18:19,"if the wind is too high, if there's a big gale, if there's a storm, then it's very dangerous to put"
00:18:19,00:18:25,your sails up because they could be completely shredded. The mask could be toppled. The boat's
00:18:25,00:18:28,"going to be there. Oh, yeah. You don't want to get any of your sails shredded instead. Put one of"
00:18:28,00:18:35,"your men up there. We've got 400 sailors and only one big sail. No, that makes sense."
00:18:35,00:18:42,Send up Stanley Big Shirt. Is that a reference to my friend? Yeah. That's very good because we've
00:18:42,00:18:45,never mentioned him on here. Probably. I don't think so. You used to have a friend whose nickname
00:18:45,00:18:50,"was Stanley Big Shirt. That's so good because it worked for the listener, and then it worked"
00:18:50,00:18:55,even better for James on a higher level. Thank you. So this is where the captain of a ship would
00:18:55,00:19:00,"say to Stanley Big Shirt and Co, ""Could you please climb up onto the Four Shrouds?"" So the"
00:19:00,00:19:06,"shrouds of a ship are, if you see a big sailing ship, there's what look like, you know, like a salt"
00:19:06,00:19:12,"coarse rope platters and climbing frames. Yeah, rigging frames kind of thing. Yeah, exactly. That"
00:19:12,00:19:16,"rigging is what the shrouds are, and they're what support the masks, and you can climb up them really"
00:19:16,00:19:20,"easily. So the sailors would all climb up, and they'd spread out their hands and legs, and they'd"
00:19:20,00:19:26,"literally just face up against the wind. Just sounds like utter nonsense, doesn't it? So they'd need"
00:19:26,00:19:33,a density of sailors such that it was the solid wall of sailors. Yeah. That's a lot of sailors.
00:19:33,00:19:36,"Well, it's a lot of sailors. So it's kind of holding, can't it, and still be pretty functional,"
00:19:36,00:19:40,but you get most of the effect. I think that was because you didn't want it to be too strong. That
00:19:40,00:19:43,"was the thing. They're not going to be as strong as a sail, but there was one. There was a ship"
00:19:43,00:19:48,"captain by Sir Hyde Parker in the 1700s, where 200 sailors were sent up into the rigging. The one"
00:19:48,00:19:53,"that Christina Thompson in her book refers to is Commodore George Anson, who was involved in the"
00:19:53,00:19:57,"War of Jenkins-Ear, which I think we must have mentioned. I don't think we have. And again,"
00:19:57,00:20:01,"for international listeners, this was a huge deal for Britain, the War of Jenkins-Ear. I actually"
00:20:01,00:20:07,"think the British listeners, the War of Jenkins-Ear is, I don't think it's GCSE syllabus."
00:20:07,00:20:11,"It was about 70, no, I'm thinking of the Seven Years' War. Sorry, no, disregard that. That was"
00:20:11,00:20:16,"a bigger deal. I would say it goes World War II, World War I, War of Jenkins-Ear are the three main"
00:20:16,00:20:21,"things on the syllabus in English schools, certainly. And basically, there's a War of Jenkins-Ear in"
00:20:21,00:20:27,"1740, which was named after a humorous slam in Parliament, where someone waved an ear around,"
00:20:27,00:20:30,Google it. I thought it was someone. I thought it was someone.
00:20:30,00:20:34,It faded a little. Jenkins-Ear got cut off in a naval fracar.
00:20:34,00:20:37,I thought it did. Didn't the cut off ear get waved around? I think I might have made up
00:20:37,00:20:41,that bit. I've embellished it in my head. Yeah. I don't think you allow props in the
00:20:41,00:20:44,hands of Parliament. That's their rule. You're right.
00:20:44,00:20:47,That's why they've had to remove the official rubber chicken from Parliament.
00:20:47,00:20:50,"It's really said they're an out-of-the-sector, and that's the one prop they have here."
00:20:50,00:20:57,"Anyway, this captain recorded in his diary in 1740 that we dared not venture any sail abroad,"
00:20:57,00:21:01,"so instead we had to put the helm of weather, as in, I think, face the helm towards the wind"
00:21:01,00:21:06,"and man the four shrouds. And in kind of classic 1700s understatement, he recorded,"
00:21:06,00:21:10,"""It proved successful for the end intended, although one of our best men did go overboard."""
00:21:10,00:21:13,"Wow. So, yeah, good trick."
00:21:13,00:21:17,"Feels like a rare move. Yeah, it must have been. They might have been doing it often."
00:21:17,00:21:21,I would say it was what we might call a life hack. It came up a bit. I was reading in a...
00:21:21,00:21:28,In Captain's Weekly. These 12 weird tricks. You won't believe number eight.
00:21:28,00:21:35,"I think it was... Silas, hate him. But, like, was that the only thing they used the sailors for?"
00:21:35,00:21:38,"Could you have used one as an oar, for instance? Lovely. Yeah."
00:21:38,00:21:43,"Your tallest, straightest soldier could be used. Bigster Tony. Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:21:43,00:21:50,"I didn't... You could look into that, because they did sometimes. I read one thing in an 1810"
00:21:50,00:21:55,"book of sailing instructions that said, ""If you're in a gale, you either man the four shrouds,"
00:21:55,00:21:58,"or if you've got some spare canvas or hammocks,"" which, I guess, the sailors are desperately"
00:21:58,00:22:02,"struggling for hammocks at this point to get up there instead. If you've got some hammocks,"
00:22:02,00:22:06,"you put them up there instead. Yeah. Well, that did actually happen once with the"
00:22:06,00:22:12,"hammocks. But in the 1920s, so that was a good, what, 200 years after? They were still using"
00:22:12,00:22:17,"random hammocks and blankets and things. So why were they doing that? Yeah, so there was a US"
00:22:17,00:22:22,"submarine that ran out of fuel and lost communications. A sail not very useful in the submarine, I would say."
00:22:22,00:22:26,What? What? You would think. You would think. There should be a milk cow around here somewhere.
00:22:26,00:22:32,"We'll be actually taking them all out at that point. They thought, ""How are we going to get home?"""
00:22:32,00:22:39,And so the commanding officer basically commanded his men to grab the hammocks and grab the blankets
00:22:39,00:22:47,and grab the bunk bed frames. And they built masts and sails and put them on their submarine
00:22:47,00:22:52,"and sailed their submarine home. That is so cool. Because submarines weren't mostly surface vessels,"
00:22:52,00:22:55,"weren't they, in the '10s and '20s? Were they? Well, they just called Marines then."
00:22:55,00:23:00,"Well, they couldn't go down for long, could they? They could, like, early proto-submarines."
00:23:00,00:23:02,Did everyone on board have to hold their breath?
00:23:02,00:23:11,"Age of sail stuff is so, is so cool. I just, I really, really like all of it. So I got some"
00:23:11,00:23:15,"nautical slang for you. The manning the foreshadows thing, I thought. This is to a"
00:23:15,00:23:18,guide to nautical slang from John Hard. And it was published only about 30 years ago. So it's
00:23:18,00:23:26,"got some more modern stuff. ""Bronzy bronzy"". It's where you conferred in a battle. That's right."
00:23:27,00:23:32,"Really bad result. Cold and silver. And you're like, ""Ah, bad news. We got bronzy bronzy this time."""
00:23:32,00:23:36,"You didn't even lose. No, that's suntanned, if you're suntanned."
00:23:36,00:23:44,Bunch of bastards. The French. Always correct. But it's also some tangled rope.
00:23:44,00:23:53,"Bunghole. Ah, no. Is it the Agnes? The newest recruit always had to,"
00:23:53,00:23:57,"it was part of the initiation ceremony, wasn't it? Bunghole. No, that's just some cheese."
00:23:57,00:24:00,"What? Cheese. Is it, do they use the cheese sometimes to bung up holes?"
00:24:00,00:24:06,"Yeah, maybe. So it's just, bunghole is cheese. Do you know what a nip cheese was? Oh, no."
00:24:06,00:24:11,"This was in a book called The Sailor's Word book, an alphabetical digest of nautical terms,"
00:24:11,00:24:17,"which is a very, very old. Nip cheese. Nip cheese. So I'm imagining it's not a kind of cheese."
00:24:17,00:24:21,"Is it just mice on boats? Oh, that's a great one. No, it's not quite that."
00:24:21,00:24:28,"We ain't got any ideas. Oh, I mean, yes, but... I'm not sure."
00:24:28,00:24:33,"Is it a nipple thing? No, it's not an Andy. Well, quite, as if, like, you guys are parents,"
00:24:33,00:24:37,"you've heard of like neck cheese, right? Oh, as in they get stuck in the folds."
00:24:37,00:24:41,"Yeah, you know, like, you know, kind of when a baby's breastfeeding and then"
00:24:41,00:24:45,the breast milk kind of dribbles down and then kind of gets stuck in the folds of their neck.
00:24:45,00:24:49,"Yeah, yeah. It's never got to a cheese like status, I have to say, in my experience. I've"
00:24:49,00:24:53,"never been able to ferment it properly. But despite your best efforts, is it?"
00:24:53,00:24:57,"Oh, yeah. I love any cheese. No, it's not the same as that, but on the nipples."
00:24:57,00:25:02,"It's the name for a purse's steward. So the person who looks after the money,"
00:25:02,00:25:07,"if you imagine, like, cutting bits of cheese to kind of share the money."
00:25:07,00:25:11,"He's like cheese pairing. Yeah, exactly like that. Stingy. Yeah, yeah."
00:25:11,00:25:14,Do you know why we call a poop deck a poop deck? Everyone shouts on it.
00:25:14,00:25:21,I don't know. Everyone shouts on it. That's what they did with it. Yeah. What's a poop deck?
00:25:21,00:25:26,"Well, a particular deck on the ship, not the main deck. The back. Well, there's the four deck,"
00:25:26,00:25:30,"there's the main deck and I don't know where the poop deck is actually. Well, if you knew that,"
00:25:30,00:25:34,it might give you a clue. Is it at the back? It's on the stern and it comes from the French
00:25:34,00:25:41,"la poop, which means the stern. Love the boat. And for that reason, you have some other things."
00:25:41,00:25:48,You have the pooping sea and that is where you're going down the sea and the current is going at
00:25:48,00:25:54,the same speed as your stern. So your rudder can't really get any purchase because you're
00:25:54,00:25:57,going at the same speed as the water. That's great. Do you know what a bunting tosser is?
00:25:57,00:26:01,Someone from the Jubilee. Is it? That's right.
00:26:01,00:26:08,"Actually, you're dead on. Oh, have I? Well, it kind of, it is flag-related."
00:26:09,00:26:13,It's a radio operator and that would traditionally have been a signalman
00:26:13,00:26:17,who has is raising the signal flags and so bunting tosser. That's exactly what I said.
00:26:17,00:26:29,"Snorkers. Just sausages guys. Just sausages. Oh, okay. And the beach master. The beach master."
00:26:29,00:26:35,"He was someone who stood on the beach and said, ""This way guys. This way. Keep going. Keep going."
00:26:35,00:26:38,"Keep going. Oh, too far. Too far. Oh, shit. Do you know what? I'm going to give you that."
00:26:38,00:26:42,"Well, and again, this is going to be something completely different."
00:26:42,00:26:47,Did he have those kind of like ping pong bats? That's it. Yeah. It's a superior officer who is
00:26:47,00:26:53,appointed to lead the storming party. The beach master. So yeah. Do you remember we talked two
00:26:53,00:27:01,weeks ago about elephant seals? They're beach masters. Our heaps of jubia. Is there ever been
00:27:01,00:27:07,a situation where an elephant seal beach master and the British naval beach master have been
00:27:07,00:27:14,"mixed up with hilarious consequences? Dozens. Oh, no. The storming party is just one"
00:27:14,00:27:18,"elephant seal with his harem of a hundred females. That's great. I mean, you would run away, wouldn't"
00:27:18,00:27:25,"you? Yeah. Scary. This is sort of relates back to the Bletchleef Act, but there was a Cornish"
00:27:25,00:27:32,"pirate called Robert Culliford, and he once loaded their cannons with China crockery in the hope that"
00:27:32,00:27:39,"it would tear the sails of the opposition ships. That's a great idea, didn't it? How'd that work?"
00:27:39,00:27:44,It did not work well. They actually exploded into a fine powder by the time they had met the enemy
00:27:44,00:27:49,"sails. So just rained down. Nice bit of rain. Yes. I think they also, they did that in the"
00:27:49,00:27:57,"Trojan War, didn't they? And that's why Greek people, to this day, smash plates at the end of a meal."
00:27:57,00:28:02,Have you heard of the pine tree riot? This is a thing that pretty much prompted the American War
00:28:02,00:28:07,"of Independence and was directly related to the navy. Okay. Well, was it tax related? Yes."
00:28:07,00:28:13,"Just getting it all right. I mean, actually, you have got it right. Yeah. So basically,"
00:28:13,00:28:19,"Britain and France both wanted to build ships and to build a ship with a big mast, you need a big"
00:28:19,00:28:23,"tree. I got this, by the way, from a brilliant book called The Age of Wood, which is such a"
00:28:23,00:28:29,"good book. You thought it was something different, didn't you? Britain had very little forest at this"
00:28:29,00:28:34,"time, partly because it's kind of all into ships, and had to get them from America, because in America"
00:28:34,00:28:40,there are these gorgeous massive pine trees that will make a cracking mast. Yeah. And they had all
00:28:40,00:28:45,"sorts of trouble. They basically decreed, right, all trees over 24 inches across, which is what you"
00:28:45,00:28:50,"need for a ship mast. They belong to the Crown, and we mark them with a little arrow and their"
00:28:50,00:28:54,"hours, and you can't have them, you colonists. And in fact, having wide floorboards was a sign that"
00:28:54,00:28:59,"you were a patriotic American colonist that you were just cocking a snook at the British,"
00:28:59,00:29:03,because you had used these wide trees. Nice. Rather than glowing the British up.
00:29:03,00:29:09,You rebel you with your wide floorboards. And this all led to this confrontation where the British
00:29:09,00:29:13,"sent the authorities to try and say, look, these really are our trees, and the Americans kind of"
00:29:13,00:29:16,sent them away with their tail between their legs and embarrassed them and humiliated them.
00:29:16,00:29:21,"And this was a thing called the Pine Tree Riot, and that was 1772, and that pretty much led"
00:29:21,00:29:28,"on to the Boston Tea Party, 1773, and from there, you know, everything went downhill."
00:29:28,00:29:36,"Yeah, but that was like, that was mostly mast related. Interesting. Yeah. The age of wood,"
00:29:36,00:29:42,"by the way, just count the rigs, that'll do it. Fantastic. James, we did spend a 300 paid contract"
00:29:43,00:29:50,"with the British. I was looking a bit into what sails are made out of. And nowadays,"
00:29:50,00:29:56,"they can be all sorts from natural fibers like cotton and blacks to synthetic fibers like nylon,"
00:29:56,00:30:01,"polyester, all of that. But one thing I found that was quite interesting to me was that hemp"
00:30:01,00:30:07,"was used basically throughout the ship for everything. So hemp oil was used in the lamps,"
00:30:08,00:30:13,"the sailors would wear clothing made out of hemp, the ship's logs would be written on hemp paper."
00:30:13,00:30:18,"But it turns out that some of these massive sailing ships, they would actually carry hemp"
00:30:18,00:30:24,"seeds with them so that if they ended up in a shipwreck or they had damage, they could plant the"
00:30:24,00:30:31,"seeds to grow hemp. Grow your ship! And then mend their rope or their canvas, because hemp is one"
00:30:31,00:30:37,of the fastest growing plants on earth. That's fantastic. That's really cool. And they would use
00:30:37,00:30:46,hemp to make the canvas for the sails and the ropes. And the word canvas actually comes from
00:30:46,00:30:54,"the word cannabis. Get away! It's good. Which is the same plant as hemp. Which is, yeah. For any"
00:30:54,00:30:59,"squares listening. Sorry, just quick mention of the old wacky-backy."
00:30:59,00:31:10,"Okay, we should move on to fact number three. And that is Andy."
00:31:10,00:31:16,"My fact is that reindeer can chew in their sleep. Oh, that's useful. It's so cool."
00:31:16,00:31:19,"Gavaskorn must do a good business in the reindeer community, wasn't it?"
00:31:21,00:31:25,So it's really clever. It's all to do with where they live because they live in the very high regions
00:31:25,00:31:34,"of the earth. Not necessarily higher, I would say. I mean further north. Not like on top of Everest."
00:31:34,00:31:38,"Okay, we're being squares about it. This is why you never travel north of Watford. You're like,"
00:31:38,00:31:44,"""Oh, I'm so higher."" I can't get the oxygen. Okay, they live in the Arctic Circle. We're being"
00:31:44,00:31:49,"like, ""Do we be?"" Yeah, sure. And obviously the light there changes a lot, doesn't it? So some"
00:31:49,00:31:54,"of the year, it's always light. Some of the year, it's never light. It's dark for ages."
00:31:54,00:32:00,"And they have a very, very weak body clock. So in summer, they have to eat a great deal all the"
00:32:00,00:32:05,"time to gain weight to survive the winter. And they're ruminants, so they bring food back up"
00:32:05,00:32:10,from one of their stomachs and they keep chewing it. And because they're having to do a lot of this
00:32:10,00:32:16,"during the summer, they will regurgitate food and they will keep chewing it while they're asleep."
00:32:16,00:32:19,We weren't sure before what they were doing. They just look a bit dazed and a bit
00:32:19,00:32:24,dozy. And the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research have measured their brainwaves while
00:32:24,00:32:29,"they're doing this, standing around chewing. And it sounds like they are in a light stage of sleep"
00:32:29,00:32:32,"while they're eating. That's brilliant. Wait, we couldn't tell if they were asleep. Do they not"
00:32:32,00:32:37,"have their eyes closed? I think brain activity is a better guide, isn't it, than whether you've got"
00:32:37,00:32:41,"your eyes closed. It's not like every time you close your eyes, you're asleep. No, I know. I just"
00:32:41,00:32:45,"feel like I'd know if I just looked at the reindeer. You'd be like, ""Well, they're obviously asleep."""
00:32:45,00:32:46,You've just fell asleep for a second there.
00:32:46,00:32:54,"That thing is really interesting about the body clocks because it means they don't get jet-lagged,"
00:32:54,00:33:00,"right? So our body clock is 24 hours. We deal with the light, the dark, we're on a 24-hour clock."
00:33:00,00:33:07,"If we go through some time zones, then we're not on 24 hours anymore and we're all over the place."
00:33:07,00:33:14,"But if reindeers would do regular flights to Australia, like they might do once a year"
00:33:14,00:33:20,"to deliver presents, for instance, they wouldn't get jet-lagged. And the interesting thing about"
00:33:20,00:33:25,"that is, you know, there are gene variants that cause this and maybe we can turn those genes on"
00:33:25,00:33:29,and off in humans one day to stop humans from getting jet-lagged. That feels like a drastic
00:33:29,00:33:38,"intervention for jet lag. Yeah, we would also grow horns. Yeah, reindeer. Reindeer are cool,"
00:33:38,00:33:41,aren't they? Most of my facts are about the Sami people who are obsessed with reindeer.
00:33:42,00:33:47,"But, well, I say obsessed. Obsessed with, usually, reliant on them for their survival."
00:33:47,00:33:49,"Guys, get over there. Obsessed with oxygen and water."
00:33:49,00:33:57,"No, I love the Sami people. They are the people who live up in the Arctic Circle, really,"
00:33:57,00:34:00,in the northern parts of Norway and Sweden and Finland. The high places of the earth.
00:34:00,00:34:06,"The high places, yes. So they paid their taxes in live reindeer for a long time. They have special"
00:34:06,00:34:11,designations sort of in the sort of equivalent of the Magna Carta of that region. So it's called
00:34:11,00:34:16,the Lap Kodassil and it was a clause added to the 1751 Treaty which designated the borders of all
00:34:16,00:34:21,those countries. And it said that they are allowed to move totally freely across borders because the
00:34:21,00:34:25,reindeer need to move across borders and they need to herd them. Although herding reindeer is
00:34:25,00:34:30,"basically just following them, I think. Oh, really? The reindeer go where they want to find"
00:34:30,00:34:34,food to get sustenance to go to better climates and the Sami people just follow them to make sure
00:34:34,00:34:39,they keep. That is mostly true. You can get them to go in the direction you want. And the way you
00:34:39,00:34:45,do that is you piss in a bottle and you carry it around with you and if they start going in the
00:34:45,00:34:49,"direction you don't want them to go in, you pour a little bit in this direction and they all go,"
00:34:49,00:34:54,"""Oh, piss lovely"" and they all walk towards where the piss smell is because it's like got salt and"
00:34:54,00:35:01,"minerals and stuff like that. Oh, just a life hack, we call that. Good to know. Anyway, they have over"
00:35:01,00:35:07,a thousand words for reindeer and they really do because reindeer are so important. So they have
00:35:07,00:35:13,"like a liami, which means a short fat female reindeer. They have a snari, a reindeer whose"
00:35:13,00:35:18,antlers are short and branched. A nijiru is an unmanageable female. And they're a bit sexist
00:35:18,00:35:25,"these names, aren't they? There's no room for your woke political niceties in the unforgiving"
00:35:25,00:35:30,"tundra, James. Well, there's a lot of snowflakes up there I have heard."
00:35:34,00:35:40,That's cool. They do have a word for a bull with one testicle. So maybe the feminist reindeer are
00:35:40,00:35:45,"getting upset and cutting off the testicles of the males. They have night vision goggles,"
00:35:45,00:35:53,"effectively, inside their eyes. Reindeer. So reindeer's eyes change colour over the season."
00:35:53,00:35:58,So they're golden in summer and then they're blue in the winter. And the reason that's helpful
00:35:58,00:36:05,is that in winter they can see a lot more UV light. And the reason that UV light is helpful
00:36:05,00:36:10,"is that their favourite food is this thing called reindeer moss. Disappointingly, it's a kind of"
00:36:10,00:36:16,lichen. But it's really yummy and it's very nutritious and there's a lot of it about in the
00:36:16,00:36:21,Arctic. So reindeer love it and they like to find it. And it's impossible for a human to find it
00:36:21,00:36:25,because it's pale. But to a reindeer it's incredibly obvious where the patches of reindeer moss are
00:36:25,00:36:29,"because it looks a completely different colour to them. Because I think snow gives off UV light,"
00:36:29,00:36:34,doesn't it? Whereas it doesn't. So it looks like dark because they have this ability to see the UV
00:36:34,00:36:39,"light. They can see what the moss is. So it's very, very cool. They're very well adapted for their"
00:36:39,00:36:44,environment. What's interesting is that they're not actually 100% sure how the eyeball actually
00:36:44,00:36:48,changes from golden to blue. And we should say as well actually that the colour changes not in your
00:36:48,00:36:54,"iris. No, because otherwise it sounds insane that they've discovered this in like 2030. It's like"
00:36:54,00:36:59,"wait a minute, we've domesticated these guys for how long? We've not looked at their eyes? So yeah,"
00:36:59,00:37:03,it's not that you're looking at them on the outside and their eye colour changes. It's the inside.
00:37:03,00:37:08,"It's the thing called the tappatum lucidum, I think I'm saying that correctly,"
00:37:08,00:37:12,which is kind of on the back of the eye and it does all of the reflecting of the light
00:37:12,00:37:18,"around your eye. Well, you would see that, I reckon, is if you were taking a photo of a load"
00:37:18,00:37:23,"of reindeer and one of them looked directly at the flash, I reckon you would see the changes over"
00:37:23,00:37:27,"there. Is that right? Yeah, that's why if you photograph animals in the dark, yeah, that's their"
00:37:27,00:37:31,"tappatum lucidum. Because that's why we get red eyes is because the back of our eyes is red,"
00:37:31,00:37:36,"because it's got a lot of blood in there. And so when the flash goes, you see the light goes into"
00:37:36,00:37:40,the back of your eye where all the blood vessels are. And that's why you get red eyes. Is that why
00:37:40,00:37:45,"you get red eyes? In old, like mostly in old, is it from film photos? Do you get that on digital"
00:37:45,00:37:51,"photos now? I've seen newer photos, yeah. Do you? Yeah, yeah. I've never done that. So that doesn't"
00:37:51,00:37:56,"point that no one had ever taken a photograph of a reindeer. I've never taken it with flash, at least."
00:37:56,00:38:00,"I think it's quite hard to take a photo of reindeer with flash. They're very camera shy, aren't they?"
00:38:00,00:38:07,"Well, they have a very shiny nose. Oh, your nose has come out red in this one and this one."
00:38:09,00:38:13,I didn't know the UK has reindeer. I was incredibly excited to find that out.
00:38:13,00:38:21,"There's one wild herd of reindeer and they're at the Cairngorm reindeer centre, but they are wild."
00:38:21,00:38:26,"It's not a zoo or an enclosure. They're not penned. High up. Very high up, near Inverness. I mean,"
00:38:26,00:38:30,probably in the top of the mountains because it's the Cairngorms I was thinking as opposed to.
00:38:30,00:38:36,"Well, that too. And they were introduced by this great couple, Mikkel Utsi and his wife,"
00:38:36,00:38:41,"Dr Ethel Lindgren in 1952, probably overshadowed by the change of monarchy and the Everest"
00:38:41,00:38:45,"expedition. But still, and they gave them all these furious reasons of why we could, because"
00:38:45,00:38:49,"it's basically early rewilding, you know, just by any other name. And the reasons they gave these"
00:38:49,00:38:53,"two scientists, they said, well, great source of meat, great source of fur, useful for military"
00:38:53,00:38:58,"transport in case of the Cold War turning hot. Sure. I saw that and I couldn't work out what,"
00:38:58,00:39:03,did they imagine that they would be bringing the reindeer to the Soviet Union and using them to
00:39:03,00:39:09,"transport stuff like military equipment or maybe are we being invaded? Nuclear winter,"
00:39:09,00:39:15,maybe. And so we get a load of snow. They might be useful. There was a story in the Russian press
00:39:15,00:39:22,"in the, when was this? It was in the 2000s that criminals like gangs were using reindeer to do"
00:39:22,00:39:28,their crimes. And the reason being that they were in Siberia. So the police are coming to get them.
00:39:28,00:39:32,"And the police had snowmobiles, but the reindeer were quicker than the snowmobiles."
00:39:32,00:39:36,And so the criminals realised that and they would use them to...
00:39:36,00:39:40,"Is there like getaway vehicle? Yeah, yeah, getaway. Cool."
00:39:40,00:39:44,"Would they ride them? No, they'd be pulled on sleighs. Yeah."
00:39:44,00:39:49,"Doesn't sound weird, these got-nick-russian criminals being pulled by..."
00:39:49,00:39:51,And children running to them.
00:39:51,00:39:57,"Well, if you've just robbed a bank, though, you've probably got sacks of money waiting on the back"
00:39:57,00:40:01,of the sleigh. Yeah. And one will fall off. Maybe that's the origin of the Santa Claus myth.
00:40:01,00:40:07,"But the Kengor reindeer-centred staff, very excitingly, they did a naked calendar just"
00:40:07,00:40:12,"a few years ago. Naked humans or naked reindeer? Naked the reindeer, I think,"
00:40:12,00:40:18,were mostly in harnesses and things. They didn't shave them all. They all died of cold.
00:40:18,00:40:23,"No, but there were 17 herders and they're all posing in the hall together to raise money for"
00:40:23,00:40:27,"the Kengor mountain rescue team. Did we approve of this? I mean, like, I don't mind"
00:40:27,00:40:31,"that group of what were they, Women's Institute people doing it the first time."
00:40:31,00:40:38,"You've repeatedly turned down my idea, James, for a fish nude calendar where we're all hiding behind"
00:40:38,00:40:44,"facts. But this trend of people doing this? Well, I'll just give you a line from the"
00:40:44,00:40:50,"photographer who said... Who said, ""It's very cold in the Kengars."""
00:40:50,00:40:56,"Taking pictures of my naked friends and colleagues, not to mention my girlfriend's mum"
00:40:56,00:41:01,"was certainly a surreal experience. I can't believe they fell for it, who said?"
00:41:01,00:41:10,She goes from town to town posing naked calendars. It's really nice to hear for a
00:41:10,00:41:17,"perfect scam, isn't it? Just go to another office. Hello! I'm just wondering if you like a naked"
00:41:17,00:41:29,"calendar or a cherry. Oh, I want a dark film, ""Canada Girls"" because I can't put that lens on it."
00:41:29,00:41:37,"Oh, dear. Good gracious. More stuff on reindeer, guys. They are very fast. The robbers are right."
00:41:37,00:41:43,And they're fast and very young. They can outrun an Olympic sprinter when they're only a day old.
00:41:43,00:41:49,"Stop it. That's so cool. What? Newborns can stand and walk almost straight away,"
00:41:49,00:41:54,"and then within an hour, they can run. That is very good. Which is good. It makes me wonder if"
00:41:54,00:41:59,"they do that competition within 15 minutes. Some parents are like, ""Mine's actually running already."""
00:41:59,00:42:06,You should get Santa's reindeer to be your financial advisors.
00:42:06,00:42:10,Because they're not employed for the rest of the year. Very nice.
00:42:11,00:42:16,Or they're free in January for the tax deadline. Exactly. They're twiddling their hooves otherwise.
00:42:16,00:42:22,"So what it is is that a team of researchers at Dartmouth College, bearing in mind this is an"
00:42:22,00:42:28,"Ivy League University, right? They did a very, very serious study where they got a bunch of"
00:42:28,00:42:35,"Santa's reindeer at a local kind of Christmas theme park. They were Dasha, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet,"
00:42:35,00:42:41,"Cupid, Donna, Blitz and Rudolph, and Boris. Boris was a trainee."
00:42:41,00:42:46,"Can I just ask, are these real reindeer, and are they really Santa's reindeer?"
00:42:46,00:42:52,"They are real reindeer, and Santa is real. Okay, cool. So they're living reindeer. It wasn't like,"
00:42:52,00:42:57,"""Mod, okay, right?"" And what they did was they laid out copies of the Wall Street Journal's stock"
00:42:57,00:43:03,"pages on the floor of their barn, and they got them to select stocks that they wanted them to buy."
00:43:03,00:43:08,"So they made hoof prints on the newspaper pages, and then they went and purchased these stocks to"
00:43:08,00:43:16,"create a reindeer portfolio. And they found that it outdid the S&P 500, which is the kind of top"
00:43:16,00:43:22,"500 companies in the US. It outdid the growth of those companies by 5%. And apparently, that's"
00:43:22,00:43:29,statistically significant. What? Is it? Is it apparently so? There's the Ivy League researchers.
00:43:29,00:43:36,"But the thing that they did... Sorry, just to say, that is significant. If you could make 5% more"
00:43:36,00:43:40,"than the average on the stock market, and you could consistently do that, then you'd be very"
00:43:40,00:43:45,"rich. Yeah, you'd be doing well. That's the consistently thing, isn't it? Well, all we have is"
00:43:45,00:43:50,"evidence that they are consistent. No, over six months. But the reason why they did this was"
00:43:50,00:43:56,"kind of to prove that senators and congressmen, who are often in America accused of using their"
00:43:56,00:44:02,"inside knowledge to play the stock market, that what they did was they compared the portfolios"
00:44:02,00:44:08,of the senators to the reindeer portfolio and found that the reindeer was still better than the
00:44:08,00:44:14,senators and the congressmen who had inside knowledge. And one of the researchers actually said
00:44:14,00:44:19,that it turns out that these politicians are as feckless as the rest of us at stock pickings.
00:44:19,00:44:24,"Well, it could be that they're scrupulously honest, and they don't use any of their internal"
00:44:24,00:44:28,"knowledge. Very, very good point. Very good point. And maybe they prove that with the reindeer"
00:44:28,00:44:33,portfolio. Or it could be reindeers are absolutely massive inside of it. They're going around the
00:44:33,00:44:38,"country once a year, like while Santas delivering the presents, they're hecking into emails. They go"
00:44:38,00:44:42,"through the filing cabinet. Yeah, they always take a bite out of the apple, drink the sherry,"
00:44:42,00:44:47,and go through all of your books. Why are there hoof prints left inside the house after he's been?
00:44:47,00:44:50,"It doesn't make any sense. No, you're so right. Do they fall down the chimney? This should be on"
00:44:50,00:44:55,"the roof. Yeah, who found the roof. That's a good title for a children's book. Lovely. Don't"
00:44:55,00:45:00,"give your reindeer's carrots. Why not? I don't know any reindeers. Next question. No, I'm listening."
00:45:00,00:45:05,"I do. Yeah. Well, just because we were saying about, you know, sherry and Ms. Pisces, I mean,"
00:45:05,00:45:10,"don't give them them either. But yeah, they can't digest them. But what am I going to cover my penis"
00:45:10,00:45:17,with in the naked calendar? Maybe there's some other baby vegetables that they make. I don't know.
00:45:20,00:45:21,Let's see if I can find a runner bean.
00:45:21,00:45:34,"Great stuff. Okay. All right, it's time to pee. Do you want to go now?"
00:45:34,00:45:35,A pee's not going to be big enough.
00:45:46,00:45:51,"Okay, it is time for our final fact this week, and that is James. Okay,"
00:45:51,00:45:58,"my fact this week is that from 1841 to 1851, the MP for thirst thought he was a bird."
00:45:58,00:46:02,He was then replaced by a man who was later killed by a turnip.
00:46:02,00:46:08,Was he killed by an actual turnip or another MP who thought he was a turnip?
00:46:08,00:46:13,He was killed by an actual turnip. Did it get into the campaign literature?
00:46:13,00:46:15,Vote for me. The other guy thinks he's a bird.
00:46:16,00:46:17,I'm safe around turnips.
00:46:17,00:46:24,"There wasn't much in the way of campaigning in these days, especially in thirst."
00:46:24,00:46:30,All of these people all got in without any opponents. Who do you want to hear about first?
00:46:30,00:46:36,"The bird of the bird man, I think. Okay, the bird man of thirst was a guy called John Bell."
00:46:36,00:46:42,"Basically, in this area, they had to have an MP. They had a railway and there were a few people"
00:46:42,00:46:48,"living there. They had to have an MP, and there wasn't really anyone to do it. A few people from"
00:46:48,00:46:52,"outside of the town came in. They might want to do it, but no one in the town wanted to vote for"
00:46:52,00:46:57,them. So they all voted for this guy called John Bell because his family owned half of the houses
00:46:57,00:47:02,"in the town, and everyone liked them. He was the right man for the job, really."
00:47:02,00:47:07,"So they voted for him, but after he'd been in there for a little while, it turned out that he"
00:47:07,00:47:15,"was of unsound mind, and they did an inquiry as to his unsoundness of mind, which took place at"
00:47:15,00:47:21,"the three tons hotel in thirst, which is now a Weatherspoons. In this inquiry, they said that"
00:47:21,00:47:26,he sometimes fancied himself to be an eagle and made motions with his arms as if endeavouring
00:47:26,00:47:31,to raise himself from the ground to fly. He was also convinced that someone was trying to poison
00:47:31,00:47:38,"him with iodine in his tea. A bit of a callback to the last episode, iodine. And then on other"
00:47:38,00:47:42,"occasions, when in company, he would forget that he was at the dinner table and start to undress"
00:47:42,00:47:48,"himself. But in those days, there was no way to get rid of someone. If they were an MP and there"
00:47:48,00:47:52,"wasn't an election, and even if there was an election and people there wanted to send back"
00:47:52,00:47:58,"the same guy, there's no way to get rid of them if they were of unsound mind. I guess I don't even"
00:47:58,00:48:03,"know how you would now, because in fact, then legislation was introduced, and then there were"
00:48:03,00:48:07,"various upgrades to it. But I think it was all repealed in about 2012 or 13. So, you know..."
00:48:07,00:48:12,I can't imagine any of our politicians would be of unsound mind.
00:48:12,00:48:16,"You're right. It's just not relevant anymore. And anyway, he unfortunately died."
00:48:16,00:48:21,"Was he an honest MP, by the way, or was he feathering his own nest?"
00:48:21,00:48:22,Very good. Thank you. Any more of that?
00:48:22,00:48:27,"No, no, no. I just had that one stored up and I didn't want it to sit around inside me."
00:48:27,00:48:33,I can't wait for your turnip pun that's upcoming. Because he was replaced by a guy called Sir
00:48:33,00:48:40,"William Payne Galway, and he was out shooting in the parish, and he walked across a turnip field,"
00:48:40,00:48:45,and he fell with his body onto a turnip. I'm quoting from the York Herald here.
00:48:45,00:48:50,"He fell with his body onto a turnip, sustaining severe internal injuries."
00:48:50,00:48:54,"No, that's a fake excuse when you're talking to the hospital, isn't it?"
00:48:55,00:48:59,"And in the Hoover, I just kicked him when the vacuum was on."
00:48:59,00:49:03,"He was nakedly shooting in a field, and he fell and the turnip went up his arse."
00:49:03,00:49:11,"No, he fell on the turnip and injured himself, and the next day he failed to recover."
00:49:11,00:49:17,"And turnips are not funny things to fall onto. They're big serious. They're big hard things, you know."
00:49:17,00:49:20,"I mean, turnips are inherently funny, I think. Sorry. I don't know why I said that,"
00:49:20,00:49:25,but they're not really funny. He wasn't the only MP who died in a turnip-related incident.
00:49:25,00:49:29,"I don't know if you guys found the story of Lewis Fenton, the wig MP for Huddersfield."
00:49:29,00:49:37,"So he died a little earlier than this. This was 1833, about 50 years before,"
00:49:37,00:49:40,"and he fell out of a window at home. Very sadly, he died of his injuries,"
00:49:40,00:49:45,"you know, tragic, and his widow explained that he was in the habit of going up to the attic"
00:49:45,00:49:49,to look out of the window at a piece of ground where his turnips were growing.
00:49:49,00:49:50,"Oh, yeah."
00:49:50,00:49:54,"To make sure that the cows had not, also his cows, had not got into the turnip enclosure,"
00:49:54,00:49:56,"and were not, you know, yet."
00:49:56,00:49:59,"So when he'd disappear for hours at a time, he'd be like, ""No, darling, you know,"
00:49:59,00:50:01,"I'm watching the turnips. I promise I'm watching the turnips."""
00:50:01,00:50:05,"Some strange noises come out of the attic. No, no, that's my turnip watching."
00:50:05,00:50:08,I don't think we're going to imply anything unsavory about a turnip.
00:50:08,00:50:13,"The band's dead, well, he should be, you know, and he probably just was looking so much that"
00:50:13,00:50:16,"he overbalanced and tipped out of the window. Must have been, must have been, yeah."
00:50:16,00:50:22,"I was just, just the word for the mental disorder that you have when you think you are,"
00:50:22,00:50:26,"let's say, a bird is clinical lycanthropy, which I just looked up and I was wondering"
00:50:26,00:50:27,whether it was a thing.
00:50:27,00:50:28,Like a werewolf.
00:50:28,00:50:30,I think lycanthropy must be werewolf.
00:50:30,00:50:33,"It comes from the idea of, yeah, exactly, being like a wolf,"
00:50:33,00:50:35,but it applies to thinking you're like any animal.
00:50:35,00:50:36,I guess they couldn't be asked to come up with a different word for thinking you're like.
00:50:36,00:50:39,You were thinking it would be zotropy or something.
00:50:39,00:50:43,"Yeah, I get, but it must be more common to think you're a wolf."
00:50:43,00:50:47,"But I just, I like the Wikipedia page on clinical lycanthropy"
00:50:47,00:50:51,just because it used the case history of a 25 year old man who was sent for treatment
00:50:51,00:50:55,"during a period of excessive hand washing, irritable behaviour, decreased sleep,"
00:50:55,00:50:56,and acting like a buffalo.
00:50:56,00:51:02,Buffaloes famously obsessively wash their hands.
00:51:02,00:51:02,They do.
00:51:02,00:51:04,"No, that's a bison."
00:51:04,00:51:06,"Brilliant, there we go. Brilliant."
00:51:06,00:51:10,That's a bucket list joke.
00:51:10,00:51:13,That was one.
00:51:13,00:51:18,"I got that from a Christmas cracker 25 years ago and I've been trying to, she hold it in."
00:51:20,00:51:20,Oh my god.
00:51:20,00:51:27,The MP's page on Wikipedia for notable MPs with records in various directions
00:51:27,00:51:28,is unbelievably good.
00:51:28,00:51:29,"I don't know who's written that, but it's..."
00:51:29,00:51:31,What do you mean records in directions?
00:51:31,00:51:32,So here's one.
00:51:32,00:51:34,The youngest MP ever in the House of Commons in England.
00:51:34,00:51:35,Oh yeah.
00:51:35,00:51:38,Christopher Monk who was elected MP for Devon aged 13.
00:51:38,00:51:39,Yeah.
00:51:39,00:51:41,How old did he become a monk?
00:51:41,00:51:41,That's the question.
00:51:41,00:51:43,Brilliant.
00:51:43,00:51:46,You know the interesting thing about Christopher Monk?
00:51:46,00:51:48,"I haven't seen that page, but I do have him in my notes."
00:51:48,00:51:49,Fantastic.
00:51:49,00:51:56,"And he in 1681 arranged a boxing match between his butler and his butcher,"
00:51:56,00:51:58,which is the first recorded boxing match in England.
00:51:58,00:52:00,That's really good.
00:52:00,00:52:01,"Yeah, 1681."
00:52:01,00:52:03,"He's a real man of the people as well, wasn't he?"
00:52:03,00:52:09,"And the butcher won, we know, but we don't know much more about that."
00:52:09,00:52:11,"He had a big right hook, didn't he?"
00:52:11,00:52:12,"Yeah, I like it."
00:52:12,00:52:13,Nice.
00:52:13,00:52:14,Thank you.
00:52:14,00:52:15,They're all coming out tonight.
00:52:15,00:52:15,Oh yeah.
00:52:15,00:52:18,Wow.
00:52:18,00:52:21,"But the oldest MP, Samuel Young, are on a list."
00:52:21,00:52:23,"No, that's brilliant."
00:52:23,00:52:25,Served until he was 96 years old.
00:52:25,00:52:26,Really impressive.
00:52:26,00:52:30,How old was Baroness Trumpington when she died?
00:52:30,00:52:31,She was really old.
00:52:31,00:52:35,"She was in the Lords, and I think most people in the Lords are at least 90, aren't they?"
00:52:35,00:52:39,"But you know, Parliament wasn't for a long time, it was very unofficial,"
00:52:39,00:52:42,"but you know, it was local landowners, and then it was Barons,"
00:52:42,00:52:45,"and then as they gradually extended the right to vote to more people,"
00:52:45,00:52:48,"they gradually thought, ""Probably can't be only Baroness."
00:52:48,00:52:49,"We've got it in the house of Trump."""
00:52:49,00:52:49,Whatever.
00:52:49,00:52:51,"Yeah, yeah."
00:52:51,00:52:55,"I liked George Sitwell, who's actually Edith Sitwell, the poet's dad,"
00:52:55,00:53:00,"but he was an MP in the 1880s and 90s, MP for Scarborough,"
00:53:00,00:53:03,and he was just a fun guy.
00:53:03,00:53:04,He spent his time writing books.
00:53:04,00:53:08,"He wrote books on pig keeping in the 13th century, lepers squints."
00:53:08,00:53:11,Acorns is an article of medieval diet and the history of the fork.
00:53:11,00:53:13,Lepers squints.
00:53:13,00:53:14,"Yeah, wrote a book."
00:53:14,00:53:16,I don't think he got these books published.
00:53:16,00:53:19,He sounds very much like a QI researcher.
00:53:19,00:53:20,"Yeah, he really does."
00:53:20,00:53:22,Researching random topics of his own interest.
00:53:22,00:53:26,"He does, and actually, very creative as well, as we all have to be,"
00:53:26,00:53:31,because he invented a musical toothbrush that played a song while you cleaned your teeth.
00:53:31,00:53:32,That is good.
00:53:32,00:53:32,That's good.
00:53:32,00:53:33,This one in the 1880s.
00:53:33,00:53:34,Yeah.
00:53:34,00:53:38,"He also invented a mini gun for shooting wasps, and the Sitwell egg."
00:53:38,00:53:43,"It was nothing, you know, you didn't sit on it."
00:53:43,00:53:45,It wasn't a Gwyneth Paltrow kind of freak.
00:53:45,00:53:48,You're sitting well.
00:53:48,00:53:51,Tell me about it.
00:53:51,00:53:52,Got the egg up there.
00:53:52,00:53:56,"No, it was made of smoked meat, which was the yolk,"
00:53:56,00:53:58,"and then it was wrapped in the white, which was rice,"
00:53:58,00:54:02,"and then a synthetic shell around it, and he tried to sell it into his self-ridges."
00:54:02,00:54:05,"So he was trying to have a new Scotch egg, basically."
00:54:05,00:54:07,"But we go stock with rice, did you say?"
00:54:07,00:54:08,"With rice, exactly."
00:54:08,00:54:11,"Well, that's like an umu subi, like the kind of Japanese one."
00:54:11,00:54:12,"Yes, I was actually going to say sushi,"
00:54:12,00:54:14,but it sounds like you've said the proper thing that it is.
00:54:14,00:54:19,"Apparently, when he went to self-ridges,"
00:54:19,00:54:21,"he walked into the front door and said,"
00:54:21,00:54:24,"""I am Sir George Sitwell, and I brought my egg with me."""
00:54:24,00:54:28,"Hello, dragons."
00:54:28,00:54:38,I love Ignatius Timothy Trebich Lincoln.
00:54:38,00:54:39,So do I.
00:54:39,00:54:41,"Another man of the people judging by his name, clearly."
00:54:41,00:54:46,But he had the most insane CV of anybody I have ever heard of.
00:54:46,00:54:50,So he was born in Hungary to an Orthodox Jewish family.
00:54:50,00:54:54,"He was a student rabbi, but then he became wanted for petty theft."
00:54:54,00:54:56,"So he fled to London, he became a Christian,"
00:54:56,00:54:59,"and then he went to Canada as a Presbyterian missionary,"
00:54:59,00:55:02,"and then he went back to England as an Anglican curate,"
00:55:02,00:55:06,and then he was an MP for Darlington in 1910.
00:55:06,00:55:09,"He ran out of money, so he stopped being an MP."
00:55:09,00:55:12,"He became a speculator in Romanian oil,"
00:55:12,00:55:15,"a German continental spy in World War I,"
00:55:15,00:55:17,and then a munition merchant in China.
00:55:17,00:55:21,"And then he converted to Buddhism, became a monk,"
00:55:21,00:55:24,and then tried to become a Nazi collaborator.
00:55:24,00:55:27,That all sounds very tiring.
00:55:27,00:55:28,He could have just been a liar.
00:55:28,00:55:32,And then you could do all that stuff.
00:55:32,00:55:36,"That's true, but the absolute cherry on the cake for me is that"
00:55:36,00:55:38,"he made contact with the Nazis, right?"
00:55:38,00:55:40,"Because he said to him, ""Listen,"
00:55:40,00:55:42,"I have declared myself the Dalai Lama."""
00:55:42,00:55:47,And I am backed by the Japanese.
00:55:47,00:55:49,"The Tibetans were less keen on this idea,"
00:55:49,00:55:50,"but the Japanese were like,"
00:55:50,00:55:54,"""Yeah, this random Hungarian Jewish Christian MP guy,"
00:55:54,00:55:56,"he can be our Dalai Lama."""
00:55:56,00:55:59,"And he said, ""I can help you lead a Buddhist uprising"
00:55:59,00:56:01,"in the East for the Nazis."""
00:56:01,00:56:04,That's a great alternative history of the war.
00:56:04,00:56:05,Right.
00:56:05,00:56:05,Did they go for it?
00:56:06,00:56:09,"Unfortunately, they didn't, sadly."
00:56:09,00:56:10,Sadly.
00:56:10,00:56:12,"Sadly, the Nazis did the war."
00:56:12,00:56:15,But how amazing would history would have been
00:56:15,00:56:17,if the Hungarian Dalai Lama?
00:56:17,00:56:18,Good grief.
00:56:18,00:56:18,The names are incredible.
00:56:18,00:56:20,What's he called it? Ignatius?
00:56:20,00:56:22,Ignatius Timothy Trebuch Lincoln.
00:56:22,00:56:24,They do have just good...
00:56:24,00:56:26,I don't know whether it's like minor aristocracy
00:56:26,00:56:28,"who are the kind of people who wear MPs in the 17th century,"
00:56:28,00:56:30,but Sir Freshville Hollars.
00:56:30,00:56:31,Lovely.
00:56:31,00:56:32,Grimsby.
00:56:32,00:56:35,I was looking at MPs who'd been injured in the line of...
00:56:35,00:56:37,"Not the line of duty, actually, just in their lives in general,"
00:56:37,00:56:40,"because there were lots who'd lost arms in sea battles,"
00:56:40,00:56:41,as Sir Freshville did.
00:56:41,00:56:44,Sackville Tufton was wounded in the Battle of Schuenevelt.
00:56:44,00:56:49,Brooke Watson lost his right leg to a shark in Havana in 1749.
00:56:49,00:56:51,"I mean, these guys had really interesting careers."
00:56:51,00:56:52,What's he doing there?
00:56:52,00:56:53,Sailing around.
00:56:53,00:56:55,"He was being used as an ore, wasn't he?"
00:56:55,00:57:00,"John Stubbs, I love this."
00:57:00,00:57:00,This is a really interesting one.
00:57:00,00:57:02,He was the MP for Great Yarmouth.
00:57:02,00:57:05,He lost a hand for distributing a pamphlet
00:57:05,00:57:06,in 1579.
00:57:06,00:57:07,"What, to a lion?"
00:57:07,00:57:08,"Oh, to a pamphlet."
00:57:08,00:57:08,Paper cut.
00:57:08,00:57:11,Bad paper cut.
00:57:11,00:57:13,"His pamphlet was titled,"
00:57:13,00:57:15,"""The discovery of a gaping gulf where unto England"
00:57:15,00:57:18,is like to be swallowed by another French marriage
00:57:18,00:57:20,"if the Lord forbid not the bans."""
00:57:20,00:57:21,And it was arguing that Queen Elizabeth
00:57:21,00:57:23,"was too old to have children,"
00:57:23,00:57:26,"and she should therefore not marry the Duke of Anjou,"
00:57:26,00:57:28,"who was a French prince,"
00:57:28,00:57:30,and he was sentenced to death.
00:57:30,00:57:32,And then that was commuted to losing a hand.
00:57:32,00:57:34,"And then just before it happened,"
00:57:34,00:57:36,"he said, ""Pray for me now."
00:57:36,00:57:37,"My calamity is at hand."""
00:57:37,00:57:38,"Oh, yeah."
00:57:38,00:57:39,"Oh, funny."
00:57:39,00:57:41,It's just nice of a pun to go before...
00:57:41,00:57:42,It should have had a podcast.
00:57:42,00:57:46,"He would have loved my bison gel, Gary."
00:57:46,00:57:48,"Speaking of excellent names,"
00:57:48,00:57:49,just a very quick one here for you.
00:57:49,00:57:54,The Labour MP for Brockstow from 1929 to 1953
00:57:54,00:57:55,was called Seymour Cox.
00:57:55,00:57:57,Brilliant.
00:57:57,00:57:58,Wow.
00:57:58,00:57:59,Brilliant.
00:57:59,00:58:00,Can't believe I've never heard of him.
00:58:00,00:58:03,"I mean, as if you're not going to cross next to his name."
00:58:03,00:58:05,"You don't need to come after Seymour, do you?"
00:58:05,00:58:07,Seymour Cox.
00:58:07,00:58:09,"Yeah, that was his name."
00:58:09,00:58:10,It was also his campaign slogan.
00:58:10,00:58:16,But that's like a name that Bart would ring up most bar with.
00:58:16,00:58:18,Seymour Cox.
00:58:18,00:58:21,I don't know what x-rated Simpsons you've been watching.
00:58:21,00:58:26,Wow.
00:58:26,00:58:27,Seymour Cox.
00:58:27,00:58:30,"Um, just one more said the MP."
00:58:30,00:58:31,"Or, except for MP."
00:58:31,00:58:32,Yeah.
00:58:32,00:58:34,"Um, God, it's so hard to choose."
00:58:34,00:58:37,"There have been so many, but I do like John Mitten,"
00:58:37,00:58:40,who was a Tory MP in 1819.
00:58:40,00:58:42,"Not for very long, because he found it really boring."
00:58:42,00:58:45,But he just did lots of fun stuff.
00:58:45,00:58:48,He once rode a horse into a hotel in Leamington Spa
00:58:48,00:58:50,and rode it up the grand staircase in the middle
00:58:50,00:58:54,onto a balcony and then jumped it down from the balcony
00:58:54,00:58:55,over the diners in the restaurant below
00:58:55,00:58:56,and out through the window.
00:58:56,00:58:59,"If you're rich and a man here, a middle class,"
00:58:59,00:59:01,you could be a cuck for me.
00:59:01,00:59:03,"I don't even think it was middle class, to be honest."
00:59:03,00:59:05,"He was very, very, very..."
00:59:05,00:59:08,He would hunt a lot and like to do it naked.
00:59:08,00:59:09,Sometimes he'd start to hunt clothes
00:59:09,00:59:11,and then apparently get so excited mid-hunt
00:59:11,00:59:12,that he'd strip off all his clothes
00:59:12,00:59:14,and then arrive back naked.
00:59:14,00:59:16,"And in winter as well, so quite hardy,"
00:59:16,00:59:19,then he hunted ducks on a frozen lake naked as well.
00:59:19,00:59:23,"He liked animals, I don't know if that ingrates you."
00:59:23,00:59:25,"It doesn't sound like he did,"
00:59:25,00:59:27,because he was hunting all the time.
00:59:27,00:59:29,He liked very specific animals.
00:59:29,00:59:30,I love animals.
00:59:30,00:59:31,I love shooting them.
00:59:31,00:59:32,I love hunting them.
00:59:32,00:59:35,Much like a lot of people who like hunting
00:59:35,00:59:36,and killing certain animals.
00:59:36,00:59:38,"He loved other animals, like his horse,"
00:59:38,00:59:40,who he used to nap with by the fireplace
00:59:40,00:59:42,and who lived inside his house with him.
00:59:42,00:59:44,He's one of these people who...
00:59:44,00:59:45,The stories are incredible
00:59:45,00:59:46,and you think he would have been a nightmare
00:59:46,00:59:47,to have in your extended family
00:59:47,00:59:49,because it's always Mad Jack Mittens turned up
00:59:49,00:59:50,and done something wacky again.
00:59:50,00:59:52,"And I think he died in poverty, in debt,"
00:59:52,00:59:54,in prison at the age of about 30.
00:59:54,00:59:55,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:59:55,00:59:57,Am I allowed to say good?
00:59:58,01:00:00,"Well, yeah, you can tell what you like."
01:00:00,01:00:02,"Yeah, he was a very eccentric dude."
01:00:02,01:00:03,"He was, he loved being naked."
01:00:03,01:00:06,That's not eccentric.
01:00:06,01:00:08,"No, it's illegal."
01:00:08,01:00:09,It's not illegal.
01:00:09,01:00:10,It's actually only illegal
01:00:10,01:00:12,if you're causing hard-walled distress or intending to.
01:00:12,01:00:14,"Sorry, you don't need to justify yourself to me."
01:00:14,01:00:18,And that very well-positioned baby carrot
01:00:18,01:00:20,saves your blushes anyway.
01:00:20,01:00:24,"My calendar, it's not a company one."
01:00:24,01:00:27,"It's just, this is actually legal calendar, 2024."
01:00:27,01:00:29,I'm not intending a larval distress.
01:00:29,01:00:31,"And if you feel it, that's on you."
01:00:31,01:00:34,"Well, I apologise if."
01:00:34,01:00:37,Sorry about the way you feel calendar.
