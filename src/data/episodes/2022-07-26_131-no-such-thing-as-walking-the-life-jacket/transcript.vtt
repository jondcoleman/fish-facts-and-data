00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Shriver.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Alex Bell, and Anna Chazinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, James Harkin.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Okay, my fat this week is that when she was Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher ordered that all government documents should have slightly different word spacing, so the different letter was leaked to the press they would know who it came from.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Are we sure she wasn't just trying to make up the word count and make it look like she'd written more?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 How did this work?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Well, if you can imagine a load of text on a piece of paper, and each of the space...

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Woah, woah, woah, still trying to make your lab.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 So yeah, imagine a load of words on a piece of paper, and each of the letters or each of the words has a space between them.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 You could make that space slightly bigger or slightly lesser depending on the word processor you're using.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 And say the ones that came from you had a 0.2 millimeter gap, and the ones from Dan had a 0.3 millimeter gap, then when they found the leaked document, they would know whether it came from you or Dan, depending on the space.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 But I mean, was there someone employed, because it's obviously going to be have to be extremely tiny margins of error, otherwise you'd just have words that were a meter apart and ridiculous.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 So was there someone in her office employed to measure with a very precise ruler, the gaps between the words? Perhaps they didn't do it with a ruler, perhaps they had some other kind of technology to do it.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Something even more advanced.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Yeah, but that's the thing, this is kind of a type of stegonography, which is kind of hiding messages in pictures or in text or whatever.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 The lot of this is very, very slight differences that when you look at them really carefully, you can see the differences.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Okay, were there any documents that we know of actually leaked in her time?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 I don't know, so I found this fact on another podcast, it's called Futility Closet, it's a really awesome podcast from America.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 And it was also in a book called The Investigators Guide to Stegonography by Gregory Kipper, but actually there wasn't that much information about it anyway.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 It seems to be something that it said that happened, but whether it did or not, I guess it's possible that it's just one of those stories, but quite good sources.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 I like the idea of it as well, because it's something that we hear so much about these days and the news for new movies and so on just trying to prevent leaks and the kind of the extra mile that they go to in order to make sure.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 So like Star Wars, The Force Awakens, all the scripts were printed on red paper.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 So if you photocopied them, the black of the writing would not show up.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 That was just a tiny little thing.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 You can see photos of the screenwriter sitting with JJ Abrams holding red scripts.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 The scripts look like Darth Maul.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 They often automate the scripts as well as input the name of the person they're giving the script to all over the paper in gray.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 The words on top in black, but you can still read the script, but it's got the name all over it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 But they do it in the films as well.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 So when you go and see a movie in the cinema, the movie that you're seeing has dots encoded in that particular reel.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 So if it's pirated by someone bringing in a camera and filming it in the cinema,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 even if you then take what was recorded on that camera and compress it and kind of change the filters and put it up online and then download it,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 you can still find these semi-visible sequences of dots that appear away from the film and work out which cinema it was that the film was recorded in.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Wow, and then track down the person who did it based on people who went to the cinema.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 I thought what you're going to say is that each version of the movie has a slightly different gap between all the words that I say.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 And so you get some people where it's like, frankly, my dear.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Is that how would Pinter plays are all about the distance between these scenes to a walk in such a popular Hollywood actor?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Interestingly, the Star Wars thing, just another thing that they did in order to avoid leaks and spoilers,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 they didn't release the soundtrack until the day that the movie was released.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 It was scheduled to be released before.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 I think the book was as well, the novelization, but the soundtrack was released on the same day

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 because if you listen to the whole thing, the music suggests to you the plot twists and it suggests to you the resolution of the movie as well.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 Which kind of makes sense.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Sort of, but it also means everyone who's working on that film has got far too involved in it and read way too much into what to any normal person would just be a piece of classical music.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Except that it's Geeks of the World who will be listening and analyzing anything that's leaked ahead of time.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 They'd all get it wrong. You just end up with a thousand different variations of what isn't a Star Wars storyline.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 That reminds me a bit of I was reading an article online about what Hodor is called in all the different languages in Game of Thrones.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 And without giving too much away, his name is explained in one of the later shows.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 But they have to have the explanation that works in all the different languages.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 And so it's working out what Hodor would be in French, say, which has the same explanation of how he got the name.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 But without giving too much away so that if you heard them in both languages, you would just know what the giveaway was.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Do you know what I mean by that?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Yeah, but that sounds incredibly complicated.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 Yeah, it isn't. It's really interesting. I might post it up actually on Twitter.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Actually, on music when Madonna released her album "American Life" in 2003, she released a fake version of the album beforehand to try and counteract piracy.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 And it was much better than the original.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 It was just a series of empty tracks.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 And like I said, it was much better than the original. What the fuck do you think you're doing in every single track?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Oh really?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 And then that was you really annoyed pirates.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 And so they got hold of it.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 They'd hold up the plank.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Yeah.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 It's the party pirates love Madonna.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 A pirate then hacked into a website and then posted the real pirated album.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 So the pirates win.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 I read this the other day and I don't know if it's something that I didn't know or whether nobody knows.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 And that is if you do walk the plank, do you know what happens to the plank?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 It just gets pulled in and yeah, I thought it was like a push out of all.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Yeah, that's what I thought as well. But apparently what it was is you would get the plank

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 and you would put it on the edge of the ship and people would walk.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 And then it would be their weight which pulls them over the edge.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 And then the plank would go into the water with them.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 What? Wait, so does every pirate ship have like 50 planks with them that they...

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Well, pirate ships are usually made out of planks. So I think they just took one of them.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Yeah, but you're like, we can't afford to have any more trespassers with dismantling our ships at the point where...

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 It's true, but I think once you've made 50 of your members of staff walk the plank,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 that's probably the least of your property.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 There's also so many people you can get to walk the plank before they're in a better position than you are

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 because they've got all the wood with them.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 So they can just build their own pirate ship.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 I actually thought it was a myth that people walk the plank anyway.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 So that's a really good point because I thought that was true as well.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 I can't remember where I read this either, so it might be that I dreamt it.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Cool. Does wood float in water?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 Yeah, so they're effectively giving them...

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 How do you think boats work?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 No, that's specifically not how boats work. You don't have to pull them out of something in their place.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 Yeah, you don't know that is fair enough. How do you think rafts work?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Well, it just makes no sense to give them a gigantic life raft in a plank of wood once you've chucked them off the boat.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Well, maybe you don't want to kill them. You just want to not have them on your boat anymore.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 I don't know if you've ever tried to make a gigantic life raft out of one plank of wood,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 but it is harder than you're making it sound.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 I'm just saying it's like we're going to walk the life jacket and then it goes in with you.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 It's just you're helping the guy out.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 A bit more common way of punishing people was to just put them on an island

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 and give them some water and some food and just say, right, you're not on the boat anymore.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 You've just got to stay on this island.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 The only way to get is the Bible and a copy of their favourite album.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 Legend if they gave you the wrong word, other album.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Alex.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 My fact this week is that duct tape shouldn't be used on ducts.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Okay.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 According to him.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 According to a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 who did some tests on all different types of tape that you could use to fix a duct and what would be the most.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 And he said that of all the things we tested, only duct tape failed.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 It failed reliably and often quite catastrophically.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 And the main problem is that it doesn't respond well to heat changes,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 which is something that ducks do a lot because they have hot and cold air in the myself.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 And it's not according to US building codes.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 It's not a satisfactory way to repair a duct tape.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 So duct tape was originally called duct tape.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Yeah.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 Could you use duct tape on a duct?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Why would you want to do that?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 It's a bill closed so they're not making so much noise.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Do you want to explain the duct thing?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 So a lot of people miss here duct tape and call it duct tape and everything's as wrong.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 But it was originally called duct tape, possibly because it was invented around the Second World War.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 And there was this type of cloth-based rubbery tape that was used to seal ammunition boxes.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 And it was waterproof and it was called duct tape because ducts are waterproof.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 And then after the war, people actually did use it for their ducts.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 And so then the company changed their name to duct tape.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 But then there is now another company.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 No, now people miss here and actually call it duct tape.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 But there is a brand called duct tape.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Yeah, there is.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 Yeah, it's called duct tape.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 Did you read the story of the woman who invented it?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 It's very sweet.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Yeah, so is this lady called Vesta Stood?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 And she worked packing rifle cartridges.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 So as Alex said, tape had to be used to keep these rifle cartridge boxes closed.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 And the way they were sealed at the time was they were waxed down.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 And then there was a little paper tab which poked out of the wax.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 And in order to open the cartridge container, then you pulled up the paper tab and it opened.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 And the thing was the paper tab kept on ripping off.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 So that meant that soldiers in the heat of war would suddenly need to get to their ammunition.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 And they'd rip off this paper tab and they wouldn't be able to open these boxes.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 And it would take ages to open.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 And she spotted this.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 And so she designed duct tape.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 And her colleagues didn't go for it.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 And her bosses didn't go for it.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 And so she just wrote a letter straight to FDR, straight to Mr. President.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 And was like, I've had this idea.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 My colleagues haven't gone for it.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 But I think it's going to save your children's lives and my children's lives in the war.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 And you've got to make it happen.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 And within a few weeks, he'd forwarded it onto the military.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 And--

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Can you believe that?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 He not only received it, he read it, then forwarded it on as an idea.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 When will we ever have that sentence again?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Maybe they wouldn't have much on that day, old FDR.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 But there was a case of duct tape saving some ducts recently.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Was that?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 Yeah, there sure was.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 So this was in Idaho a couple of years ago, I think.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 And people noticed that a mother duck was standing over a drain.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 And some of her little ducklings had fallen into the drain.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 And so the residents of this place gathered around and they got some duct tape.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 And they wrapped it with a sticky side out and they inserted it at the end of a stick into the drain and attached the chicks to it and pulled them up.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 So--

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 They still attached to this day.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 They are, but they're grateful to be out of that drain.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 So duct tape should be used on ducts.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Yes, it should.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 Duct tape should be used on ducts, but not ducts.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 But only ducts trapped in ducts.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Yes.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Speaking of that, a duct tape company.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 I was looking into their products because they have a lot of novelty products.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 And one that I found was they do a one-direction duct tape.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 So it's-- if you like the band one direction, you can buy duct tape of one direction.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 You can buy Justin Bieber as well.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 I went on to Amazon.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 It's incredibly popular.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 They've had 236 reviews.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 80% of which are five star reviews.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 In fact, there's only a few one-star reviews.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 I wrote one down.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 I brought duck brand one direction printed duct tape.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 But instead arrived a regular one without the images of Harry Lee and Louis Nile Joseon.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 I don't want a regular one.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 I want the product that I bought one-star.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 But yeah, they do all these novelty things and fans are obsessed with it.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 It kind of makes sense.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 I think that's really cool.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 They write names on the wall using the duct tape.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 That's very cool.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 Is it cool?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 It's kind of cool.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 If it's for--

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 For a 14-year-old girl, maybe.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 Yeah.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 I'm going to say, yeah, maybe.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 There is a whole culture of making things out of duct tape.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 It's the most versatile thing on this earth.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 I swear.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 Oh, strong game.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 It is.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 That's a few human manmade products.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 Well, that's like that many products.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 Duct tape is an actual-- you can tear it with your hands.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 But then if you fold it up on itself, so it's too tape-stick as it were,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 that can lift nearly a ton without breaking.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Wow.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 And there is one duct tape company that holds a high school competition every year

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 to all the best prom dress created entirely out of duct tape.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 And the winner receives a $3,000 scholarship.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Wow.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 And the lifetime of bullying.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 Yes.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 I can never get it off.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Well, there's the annual duct tape festival as well that happens every year

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 hence being called the annual duct tape festival.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 It's in Ohio.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Because you can do everything sculptures.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 You can make hammocks out of them.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 It's awesome.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 You can't go to space with just duct tape.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 But you can do a lot.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 And I feel-- have you guys ever visited the website of the duct tape guys?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 No.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 I think they might be your soulmates, Alex.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 So yeah, you know, it's all my favorites, obviously.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 It's incredible.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 So much effort has gone to this website of these two guys who are just obsessed with duct tape.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 And the way you enter the home page is the duct tape guys.com, I think.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 And it says, click on the duct tape luggage to enter.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 And I didn't realize what it said.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 I just clicked on anything.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 And then there are five, four pictures of luggage.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 One of them has made of duct tape the others aren't.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 If you click on the others, you don't get into the site.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Very clever.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 Tells you what they're about.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 And they have page after page after page of things you could make out of duct tape.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 It is extraordinary.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 But yeah, like quite good ideas stylish flip flops.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 They suggest which I thought I might give a try.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 Yeah, quite cool.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 All these things are great, but you can make them all out of other materials.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 And the fact that people are making them out of other materials, like flip flops, for instance.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 The fact that people make them out of rubber and not out of duct tape usually makes me think that perhaps duct tape isn't the best material.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 I guess so if you're on a desert island, your luxury item might just be your role of duct tape because of the amount of things that you use.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 You have one with Justin Bieber's face on as well because it's company as well.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Yeah.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Is that the company you want?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Let's hope you get the right one shipped to you because Amazon has a history of sending.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Imagine that disappointment.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Imagine that your other desert island.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 You've got some duct tape without Justin Bieber's face on it.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 When Madonna, rather, where she's saying fuck you.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 And a plank.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Anna, you said it can't get you to space earlier.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 Interestingly, space is one of the places where duct tape is the most useful thing that you can have.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 Almost like a desert island kind of situation.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 So it's carried on every single flight since about Gemini missions.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Yeah.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 It's not everyone.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Wow.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 And it isn't Apollo missions.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 Yeah.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 What kind of stuff is it doing now then?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Well, okay.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 So just through, I don't know like on the ISS right now, but Apollo 13 very much says that one of the main reasons they were able to get back was because of the duct tape.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 And also if you're if you're in space and let's say you're on a mission to the moon and someone suddenly goes nuts, suddenly lose.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 What am I doing up here?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 This is too crazy.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 You can take them down.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 You take them down.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 Then that genuinely was part of the manual.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 I'm not sure for the Apollo missions, but it says you immediately what you do is you duct tape their hands and feet together.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 Wow.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 And then maybe to the maybe to the wall or something.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 When you say take them down, it's not you don't take them to the wall.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 Yeah, I read that and it says that you take the hands and feet like you say, but then you tie them down with a bungee cord.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 But that means they have a bungee cord.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Yeah.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Where's that being used?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 I think that's what they should do with spacewalks, right?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 Just do like bungee jumping out of the.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 That's amazing.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Yeah.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 I have just one last example as well for space, which was Jean Sonan.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 So he's the last man to stand on the moon.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 When he was up there for his mission, they had a moon buggy and the moon buggy as they were about to get into it and start exploring.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 He ripped off the fender of the moon buggy and the problem was is that obviously the buggy still operated without the fender.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 But they needed it on and the reason they needed it on is because if you drive in space, the moon dust will just shoot up onto the astronauts costumes, which sounds fine.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 But I found this really interesting. Apparently, if your space suit gets covered in moon dust, that means that the sun can start overheating you because it conducts it a lot better.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 So the idea is that as an astronaut, you would just fry in the suit.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 It would absorb it because it's darker.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 So it was a big thing.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 So they had duct tape and they managed to duct tape the fender back on and that kept the whole mission going through their geological expedition that they were doing.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 I don't think they could make all the space suits costumes, though.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 It's slightly tricky, though.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Partish hot costumes.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Everyone go to this fancy dress party in the same outfit and have a embarrassing.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 And that is my fact.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 My fact this week is that Oxford University's first ever professor of chemistry believed that fossils were actually frozen urine.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 Mmm.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 And then not are they?

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 No, it's worth pointing out that he didn't think it was animal life at all.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 Frozen urine was one of the things that he thought it was.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 He thought generally fossils were salt.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 I think he thought that that's what made their mark.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 But at no point at all, did he think that it could have been an animal?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 I don't know if it just didn't occur to him.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 So his name is Robert Plott, founding curator at the Ashmolly Museum.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 And he's also very famous because he found what was the first ever dinosaur bone as it were.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 He did a drawing of it.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Again, he didn't know that that was a dinosaur bone.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 He thought that it might have been a giant human, a thigh bone of a giant human.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 And so yeah, he's a very famous guy for doing quite a few things.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 And can we just go back to the bit where he looked at a fossil.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 And we've all seen examples of fossils and thought what that reminds me of is frozen urine.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 Yeah.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 Do we know why he drew that conclusion?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 Well, I think what it was is back in the day.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 So this is what, 18th century?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 This is 17th century.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 So you had like two lots of people.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 Some of them thought that they were natural things that had been made from animals.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 And the others thought it was just a physical process that they were made out of rocks.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 And that they had nothing to do with animals at all.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 And he was one of these people who thought they were made out of rocks.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 And his idea of how they might have formed is that the urine reacted with the rocks.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Yeah.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 It's urine salts, isn't it?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Or something like that?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 What they're called urine salts that he thought made that specific pattern.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 And what I thought was quite interesting was that the dominant view was that they weren't living things.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 So that was really, really controversial for reasons probably related a lot to religion.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 But the sort of dominant philosophical way of thinking was platonic at the time.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 And so they adopted this neoplatonic approach, which is what they call it,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 which is the idea that everything in nature sort of mirrors everything else.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 And there are patterns throughout nature.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 So something that you find in the ground will have a pattern that imitates something that you'll see in the air.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Or patterns on birds will be the same as patterns in the earth.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 And so when they found these fossils, that almost just confirmed the philosophy that a lot of people lived by,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 that Plato had said this is how the world works.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 There are all these things on earth and they all conform to this specific pattern.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 So they saw something that had exactly the same spirals as an animal might have on it.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 And they thought, well, that makes sense because things in existence mirror other things.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 And thinking maybe that is actually an animal.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Wow. Some people, of course, there was folklore behind them.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 So you would think that an ammonite, which is the kind of spirally fossil, was actually a snake,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 which had been turned to stone by St. Patrick.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 It was thought by a lot of people.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Really?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Yeah.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 Or St. Hilda.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 And stars were a common apparent cause of fossils weren't they?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 People often thought that they'd been caused by falling stars or the action of stars on the ground had created fossils.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 I think that was something that Leonardo da Vinci tried to tell people definitely couldn't be true and make any sense.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 Oh, and another thing was it was controversial.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 I think they were living things that had lived more than, let's say, 6,000 years ago,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 because at the time everyone was kind of creationist.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 And so they couldn't believe that anything existed before that.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 The universe was supposed to be created in 4,000 or 4 BC.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 Yes, exactly.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 But for some people, fossils, when they were discovered, confirmed creationism,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 because they were evidence of Noah's flood having swept lots of sea creatures up onto the mountains.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 And so they were saying, look, this is his, the flood did this.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 It brought all these things up to the mountains and then it retreated and left them here.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Which is kind of almost true, isn't it?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Yeah, it is.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 Yeah, it's just a much longer time frame.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Yeah.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 The guy who came into curating the Ashmolian straight after plot, who was called Edward Lloyd,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 he thought that vapors came from the sea.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 They carried spores.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 The spores landed in rocks and then somehow the rocks managed to turn the spores into animals like fish.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 Right.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 Yeah, he was wrong as well.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 But he thought that life was created from non-life.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Not necessarily life, but it was that these objects.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 So it's, you've got something that looks like a fish, what created it?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 It might never have been alive, but something has been made that looks a bit like a fish.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 And he thought it might have been spores that had gone into the rocks.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 And there was some kind of process which allowed that rock to turn into a fish.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 Okay.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 Wow.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 He's not too far away.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 Because he's still at least placed a life form into the, so it's only it was partially organic.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 It's hard, isn't it?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 Because these things don't make any sense until you know the answer.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 Yeah.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 And so you've got to come up with something, haven't you?

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 What was it?

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 So, yeah, when you saw the dinosaur bone, that makes total sense to go, well, this must have been just a giant human.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Back then, that maybe wasn't an outrageous suggestion because they were finding all these weird big things.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 They thought, well, maybe we shrunk as well.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 I always wondered this because you always find evidence of a giant millipede has been found a million years ago,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 or a giant lizard or a giant bird, which is a dinosaur or a giant shrew has just been found.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 Or a giant kangaroo has been found.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 Where are the giant humans from the past?

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 The thigh bone, the robot plot, discovered.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Yeah.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 100 years later, it was given to Richard Brooks.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 And he called it scrotum humonum because it looked like a giant scrotum.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 And it's quite annoying because he went through robot plots papers and he started looking through them and organizing them.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 And then he found that drawing and he wrote scrotum humonum.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 And it sounds to me like he didn't genuinely think that that was solid balls.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 Yeah.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Because I don't think anything has solid balls like that.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 It's odd to think that that was.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 But yeah.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 Corrista's.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 Corrista's to one exception.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 You know, he thought it was an elephant when he first found it.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 And then he wrote that so he found this huge bone.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 And he said, I thought it was an elephant bone from when the Romans invaded.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 So they came across with elephants invading us was the theory.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 And then he reported that there happily came to Oxford while I was writing of this,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 a living elephant to be shown publicly with whose bones I compared hours.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 So an elephant just rocked up into town.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 And I don't know how he got access to it.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 I guess he compared his own thigh bone to the elephants and went.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 Yeah.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 Doesn't look the same at all.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 I like the idea of that happy coincidence that there happened to be an elephant in town.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 Yeah.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 Yeah.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 That's quite good.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 It's rocking up.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 I wrote to the Ashmoline Museum to say, do you still have the bone?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 And they said, we don't keep dinosaur bones here.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 And you should try out other places.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 And I started looking into it more.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 Turns out they lost it.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 No one knows where this, where this bone, where this giant scrotum is.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 And actually the giant scrotum is, it plays a very fundamental role in our understanding of dinosaurs.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Because yes, Richard Brooks saw it and he described it and called it the scrotum of a human.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 But then Richard Owen saw it as well.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 And Richard Owen at that time was putting together his theories about what eventually led him to coining the word dinosaur.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 And the first dinosaur that he put together, the pieces together, was the Megalosaurus.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 And that bone, scrotum humanum, was part of the Megalosaurus.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 So that initial drawing actually led to the conclusion of dinosaurs, which is quite cool.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 So plot had no idea what he'd discovered.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 But there we have it, the first drawing of a dinosaur bone.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 Yeah.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Quite cool.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 He was super useful, even though he had wacky theories.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 I guess it's like a lot of people from that era.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 He just collected loads and loads and loads of stuff and recorded it, right?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 Yeah.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 So a lot of things that we later realized would have been drawn from his work.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Got to give him some credit.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 Yeah.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 I mean, everyone would have been thinking like that at the time.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Yeah.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 It's not, it would not have been out of place to suggest some sort of mythical, mystical kind of background that is in line with the church at the time.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 He died in 1696 after suffering from a urinary complaint.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 I thought that was quite.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 How fitting.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Yeah, fitting.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 In April this year, we discovered an ancient daddy long legs that's been encased in amber for nice 9 million years and it has an erection.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 Really?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 Yep.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Wish it was not just a spare leg.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 No, it's definitely an erection.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 They had a sense of the Daily Mail.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 I didn't know they could get erections.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 I mean, I just didn't know they had a stick penis either.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 Yeah.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 And just my favourite theory about where fossils came from actually from this era was a lot of people thought that they were a prank by the devil to try and test your faith.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 But others thought that they were God practicing to make life.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 So he made these fossils before he had the balls to really go ahead and make a living thing.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 He thought I'll practice with some of the shapes.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 And so they were just like his sketches before he made actual living creatures.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 That's a great theory.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 It's good, isn't it?

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 Yeah.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 Maybe the moon is a practice earth then.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 If then all the fossils are practice animals.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 Maybe you would have fitted right in in the 1600s.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 It's so good, yeah.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 On urine fossils, urine can fossilise and hyrax urine is telling us about climate change.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 So this is this really clever geologists have discovered which is that hyraxes which live in South Africa and places like that.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 You can probably picture them, they look like big jubbles or guinea pigs.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 Although actually their closest living relatives are elephants and manatees which is kind of cool.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 But anyway, these big jubble things that are related to elephants and they always urinate in the same place.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 To the extent that once they've picked a urination spot they'll keep doing that generation after generation for thousands and thousands of years.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 Wow, the same family just forever.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 Same family forever.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 So some of these fossils date back 30,000 years or more.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 They've been urinating in the same place, your father's father pissed here and your bloody piss here.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 Imagine how rebellious a hyrax it would be who pissed somewhere else after 30,000 years.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 But anyway, this eventually has crystallised over thousands of years into blocks of stratified material.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 And by investigating it we can see what hyraxes were eating at different times in the last 30,000 years let's say.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 So if you get a strat the smells of asparagus.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 Exactly, it was a smelly time in 10,000 BC.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 You can tell what vegetation's grown.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 And so we can tell what was growing when based on these sticks of hyrax urine.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 Because you've taken samples from the surrounding area.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 Yeah, exactly. They've collected their own geological samples.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 Maybe that's why they're doing it.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 And we've just come along and kind of smash it all up to look at it and they're going,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 "Okay, cool. We were going to make a museum out of that in a few thousand years."

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 So, where are we going to piss now?

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show and that is Chazinski.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 My fact this week is that Leonardo da Vinci made sculptures out of Marzipan and got angry when people ate them.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Was it a massive, you know, David or...

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 That was the original David, yes.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 Or they tiny little things like Spongebob.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 No, I think they were very elaborate a lot of them.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 So, I know this from one of his notebooks in which he says that he'd made all these intricate Marzipan sculptures for the court in Milan that he worked for.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 And he said, "I have observed with pain that people gobble up all these sculptures I give them right to the last morsel.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 And I'm determined to find other means that do not taste as good so my works may survive."

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 Which he did, fortunately.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 So, do you think they viewed for his whole life he was doing sculptures in different things like cheese?

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 Nope, they're eating that as well.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 Stake.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 The original one at least was made up pizza, but that's very long.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 He has a whole... I genuinely did not know this until you told us that fact that he had a whole career working as a chef.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Yes.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 I had no idea.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 Like, he ran a restaurant.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 I've struggled so much verifying this because there's this book of notes which some of a couple of places say is controversial, that it's his.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 But then a lot of books write this down as his absolute career.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 But I don't know how dangerous it is that we say it.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 What you're saying is maybe his notes have got mixed up with God and Rumsy's notes also.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 I got very sweary around page five.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 But yeah, they do say that he used to be a chef, didn't he?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 So, he worked at a restaurant.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 Yeah, a stepfather was a pastry chef and he had a nickname when he was 17, a fat boy.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 And he was a wedding planner, like an extended entity, doing wedding planning.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 Yeah.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 This whole side of DaVinci, I had no idea.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Yeah.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 And he took over. The only reason he became a chef, so he was just working in the restaurant.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 But supposedly in 1473, there was a poisoning that killed the majority of the cooking staff, so he just took over.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 A chef, and the three snails, wasn't it? Yes, yeah. But then I think he got fired because he liked to make kind of newvo cuisine style,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 really tiny, delicious, perfectly sculpted portions, and people didn't care for that.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 They just wanted huge amounts of food.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 But there's another continuation of the story, which says that he paired up with Botticelli to do some art with Botticelli at one point.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 That's definitely true.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 And him and Botticelli started a restaurant together called The Three Frogs.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 And this is on the a faezy gallery website in Florence, the gallery in Florence, and various other Spanish sources.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 And Italian sources say that, yeah, him and Botticelli started this restaurant together.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 And the way it works, according to tourist sites, but again, I would love first-hand information on this if anyone has it,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 is that the guest could choose the dishes by reading the menu, which was written from right to left,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 because that was how Leonardo da Vinci famously wrote, or they could choose the dishes by looking at the pictures that were drawn by Botticelli.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 Which sounds so implausible, but what a great idea.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 It's like a themed restaurant. It's like Hannah Holley.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 He invented a giant whisk, apparently.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Oh, yeah, his adventures.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 It was larger than a man.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 What could you whisk with that?

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 I think the model, so this is just a sketch of his.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 I don't think he actually created it.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 We always say inventors stuff when he just drew it.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 I know, he drew it.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 I was going to say, there's a doodle.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 But all that is, is it's a normal size whisk with, on the right hand side, scale one to one hundred.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 It's not like his drawing will have been bigger than the man.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 He drew a man in the whisk.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 I think part of the operation of the whisk is that a man has to be inside it.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 That's just a man with no sense of perspective in his drawings.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 How can we be sure that he didn't invent the tiny man?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 He has some of his other bits of artwork that have been destroyed and kind of not respected.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 We know the Last Supper came really close to destruction during the war and the Allies fought Allied forces bombed it.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 And there's that amazing picture of the whole building destroyed,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 except for the one wall that's got the Last Supper on it.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 So he was also sort of a bit of a sculpture.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 But the only sculpture we have surviving of his is a beeswax model of a horse

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 that was supposed to be a model for a proper sculpture like a plant.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 Was that a model for?

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 He was going to do a massive brass man in a horse, wasn't he?

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 Heal Colosse, I think.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 Yes.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 And they basically got loads and loads and loads of brass from all over the country,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 even all over Europe, maybe.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 And they never made it because they went to war and used them to make guns or something like that.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 That was a different one from the one made of beeswax.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 But yeah, it was for the Duke of Milan, that was the one he was talking about.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 And then he had made a plaster cast of that.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 And they were always waiting for the bronze to arrive.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 And then they used the bronze for the war and they used the plaster cast for target practice.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 The last supper was also used to target practice.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 I can believe that.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 Really?

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 When the Berlin Spurs were camped out in that town, they used it.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 Why isn't it more damaged?

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 It was too high for Jesus.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 They were aiming for Jesus's head and they got one bullet through it and it's been restored.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 So they were terrible as well?

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Yeah, awful.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 Thank God.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 Poor guy.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 Just an entire history of his works being destroyed.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 And rats ate another one of his food sculptures.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 I think I was reading this in.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 That was the one he made out of cheese, wasn't it?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 This was, so James, you're asking at the start how big his Marzipan sculpture was.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 And this particular one was an altar of Polenta and Marzipan.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 He made for his patron who was this guy called Ludovico Sforza.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 And it was for this guy's wedding.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 And so he made a sculpture, our Polenta and Marzipan, that measured 72 square yards and was covered with cream.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 And he made this a few days before the wedding.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 And before the wedding could happen, it was eaten by rats and insects in Milan.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 It was such a thing.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 Marzipan, it seems that it was used for table decoration as much as it was used for eating.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 And actually, a huge purpose of sweet food in the 16th and 17th centuries was to decorate tables.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 We might have said before, in fact, I'm sure I must have said it because it's one of my favourite ever facts

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 that Antoine Carem made a Marzipan vagina for someone's christening.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 It was a christening of a noble person in France, I think it was.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 And he made a clockwork vagina made out of Marzipan, that a Marzipan baby came out of.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 I think we have definitely said that before.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 And I think you can't say it too much.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 Whenever it gets mentioned, we should leave it in.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Marzipan is apparently incredibly malleable, really good.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 It's like better than clay for building a sculpture.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 That's why he liked it.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 Apparently it's better than duct tape and everything.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 When they wallet, they make flip flops out of it.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 And my spaceflight, Marzipan was taken in just a minute.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 He's credited with inventing the napkin as well.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 I've never heard that before.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 He was credited by idiots, so yeah.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 He also invented the first CV, didn't he?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 The first resume.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 Did he?

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 Did he write it on the napkin?

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 He probably wrote the fact that he made the first CV on his CV as well.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Oh yeah, inventor of the CV.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 I can't believe this.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 That just can't be true.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 It can't be true that he was the first person to wipe his mouth

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 with a bit of cloth.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 And it can't be the true that he was the first person to write down everything he felt.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 He did what he wrote when he was serving at the table of his patron.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 He noticed that people would be just wiping their faces

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 on the table cloth or on each other's clothes.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 He wrote a list of manners that would be expected at the table.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 And one of them was nobody should clean his knife with his neighbor's clothes.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 So people were just cleaning stuff with whatever was to hand.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 And so he introduced the idea of giving everyone a napkin

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 specifically for wiping their hands.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 I like that he's like, well now you finished eating my marzipan sculpture.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 I spent ages, I've at least wiped my mouth with this.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 I've invented it.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 Some things that he definitely did invent that didn't exist beforehand

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 were his weapons for war.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 Yeah.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 So he invented a mechanism for repelling enemy ladders.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 And like Wallace and Gromit, they're brilliant.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 Yeah, a more efficient way to poor burning oil on enemy heads.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 And more, finally, a more efficient way.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 It's like an infomercial because I'm dropping a little bit more.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 I never get it over my animal soldiers.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 He also is supposed to have invented the idea of the contact lens.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 But I saw the picture and the idea is that it's a bowl,

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 basically a bowl full of water that you put your entire face in

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 and the water refracts.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 Which isn't really pretty cool.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 Did he invent the snorkel as well?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 Or is this the thing?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 You can't really use it for any length of time.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 Hang on, so you plunge your face into a bowl of water

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 and open your eyes and you can see better.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 Yeah, the water is supposed to counteract.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 But the refraction in the water is supposed to counteract.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 The short-sightedness.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 He sometimes misfired, didn't he?

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 I think.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 And he pretty much always misfired.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 A lot of his medical ideas, because he did the section

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 which was illegal, but he came up with lots of medical theories

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 which were not accepted for hundreds of years.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 But the truth is that people didn't read his work for hundreds of years

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 because it was illegible.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 A lot of it was written in code.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 So, and a lot of it just wasn't read.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 So, none of his scientific advancements were ever really useful

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 because by the time people translated his work and found out that he'd come up with it,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 they'd already made those advancements.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 Oh, right.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 Oh, really?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 I think that's my problem as well.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 I have really bad handwriting.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 You can't imagine, yes.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 So, I assumed there was a lot of artwork that survives of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 For some reason, in my head, I had it at over 100, at least, different paintings and wall paintings and so on.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 But there's 15 and of the 15, a lot are disputed, because he never signed his name.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 I think Mona Lisa might be the only sign, what is it?

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 Is it, really?

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 I don't have something in the back of my head, so I'm not sure it's true.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 I'm not sure if it is Mona Lisa sign, because the thing I read said that none of them are signed by him.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 Maybe it is, though.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 Maybe that might be an exception.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 But a bunch of the paintings are disputed.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 No one, all we're taking it upon as a verification is that the art historian has said, I think that this definitely is Leonardo's work.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 That's true. A lot of paintings, I think.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 That's a memory, though.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 So we're kind of attributing a lot of the history of art to someone that might not have done it.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 Well, that's, so if you're going to an art gallery, it'll always be like that, but art experts do seem to have this bizarre magic knack of telling exactly if a painting is painted by someone or painted by the very closely imitating people.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 There are lots of ways of telling them like that.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 So mostly they can tell the brush strokes or the type of paint that they used all sorts of different ways of doing it.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 But yeah, that's definitely true.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 The Mona Lisa is a great one because there's like three or four different versions.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 There's the famous Mona Lisa, which is--

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 Isn't there a topless one?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 Yeah, there's a new one that was painted the more nirvana and it's supposedly painted by his pupil, Sally.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 And we also know him from his notebooks because you've got all of Leonardo's notebooks with his amazing backwards handwriting.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 And then you've just got like shitty doodles of like penises with legs running around.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 So I didn't know if that was real because it looks so fake.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Yeah, Sally was apparently Da Vinci's lover as well, which I think is almost undisputed.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 And he took them in very young age apprentice.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 Yeah, and yeah.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Because there are very bad penises with leg drawings, apparently by him, but I can't believe it. I'd love to see the original.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Yeah, but yeah, no, literally his version, supposedly if it's his, he just did a version of Mona Lisa that's just gone a close on.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 And then there's also another Mona Lisa that is supposed to be exactly the same that was apparently done by another one of his pupils.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 Which is in much better conditions, because it's not faintless and it's just hanging somewhere.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 Just in someone's living room.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 Well, one of the paintings he did that was disputed was his first ever painting.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 And this was going to be my headline facts, which is that the first painting he painted, he had to paint as punishment for eating too many sweets.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 But this is when he was an apprentice and he worked in the studio of an artist called Viruchio.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 And he used to get packets of sweets sent to him.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 And apparently he had a very sweet tooth was responsible for Crapulando, which essentially means stuffing your face.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 And so Viruchio punished him by instructing him to paint an angel in the corner of his big picture of the baptism of Christ.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 Which I don't know why that's punishment when you've come to study art.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 And you're, yeah, it's your main passion.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 But anyway, that's apparently his first painting is this angel.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 If you look up Viruchio's baptism of Christ, there's adventures with angel in the corner.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 You know that extremely old drawing of Da Vinci, the self-portraits that's done in, they call it the red chalk one.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 Yeah, so it's the kind of sketch look and yeah.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 So even that is disputed about whether or not that's Da Vinci and whether or not he did it himself.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 And one of the main reasons behind that is the guy in the drawing is way older than Da Vinci lived to.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 Oh, really?

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 Yeah, he's his way older.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 Maybe he's being modest.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 Well, no, one, so one of the theories that allows them.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 Maybe he just likes a bit rough that day.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 One of the theories is that he did draw himself and that he drew himself older because he was using it to put forward to give to Raphael,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 who was painting Plato in the School of Athens.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 And he wanted to use Da Vinci as the model, but Da Vinci wasn't old enough, so he did an older version of himself.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 But it would be quite accurate because usually self-portraits are going to be mirror images, but he writes backwards anyway.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 So he would have drawn it backwards and so he inverts the mirror image.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 And then he'd be like, "Oh, look really weird."

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 Do you think I'll just do that when they do a self-portrait?

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 They're looking in the mirror and as soon as they finish they step back and are like, "Oh, is that what I look like?"

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 Why did no one tell me I have a green thing in my teeth?

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 Oh, no, look at my eyes close.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
