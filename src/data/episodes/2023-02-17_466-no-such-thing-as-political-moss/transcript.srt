00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,040
 Hi everybody, just before we start this week's show we've got an exciting announcement to make

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,440
 and that is that our half-sister show, our sort of semi-sibling show,

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,920
 the Museum of Curiosity, is coming back! Absolutely, it's a show on BBC Radio 4,

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,200
 it takes place on Mondays starting from the 20th of February at 6.30 in the evening and even more

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:34,640
 excitingly our half-podcast sister Anna Tyshinski is starring in this year's series. Yes, that's

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,720
 exactly right. The show is hosted by John Lloyd, the father of QI, it's a sort of fictional museum

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,200
 and imaginary museum and every week they have brilliant guests submitting strange and wonderful

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,360
 and imaginary objects to the museum. John is the director of the museum and Anna this series is

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,240
 going to be the curator so that's really exciting. Absolutely, if you love NoSix Things A Fish and

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:02,000
 if you love QI you will absolutely love Museum of Curiosity and just to remind you it's on Monday

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,840
 the 20th of February at 6.30 and for the subsequent six weeks. Okay, on with the podcast! On with the show!

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:30,720
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,400
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,560
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,000
 with fact number one and that is Andy. My fact is that there's a type of moss called political

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 moss. Jesus, is there? Yeah, well that's a great question Dan, no there isn't. What? Thank you for

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,400
 bringing it to the show. No wait a minute, your fact is that there isn't a type of moss called

19
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,760
 political moss. So what this fact is, that phrase "there's a type of moss called political moss"

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,320
 is something that a listener got in touch with, okay, a listener called Beau Stuckey

21
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:24,080
 and he had been in touch with chat GPT which is a newish kind of artificial intelligence

22
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,160
 conversation bot basically that's one of the most powerful ever created but in fact I think

23
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,840
 might be the most powerful ever created. A time of recording. Yeah, exactly, I mean if you're

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,880
 listening to this after the revolution it's the second most powerful ever created and if you're

25
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,520
 scurrying through rat holes and you know like eating old packaged food and fleeing the robots

26
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,440
 then yeah anyway but chat GPT is currently best in show and he asked chat GPT to come up with an

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,640
 episode of Fish about that fact of political moss and it came up with I would say a pretty good

28
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,240
 transcript. Okay yeah do you think? Yeah well can we can we read the transcript and just see how

29
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,840
 it sounds? You've passed them around to all of us so it feels like we've got no choice.

30
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:09,040
 Okay so everyone has a name here except me, I'm a host I guess. Okay welcome back to the show

31
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,680
 which we never say. No. Welcome back to the show, I'm your host Dan. With me today we have James,

32
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,200
 Anna and Andy. So Andy what do you have for us today? Well I've got a real doozy. Did you know

33
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,240
 there's a type of moss called political moss? Political moss? That sounds like something out of

34
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,720
 a dystopian novel. No no no it's a real thing. Apparently it was discovered in the 1800s by a

35
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,160
 botanist named William Jackson Hooker and get this it's called political moss because it prefers

36
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,320
 to grow in areas with high levels of pollution. Hey funny, funny chat GPT. Sorry I've gone off

37
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:51,120
 script. I'm so sorry. Right back in the game. Wow that's really interesting so it's like a canary

38
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,800
 in a coal mine for environmental pollution. Yeah I can see how that would make sense and I bet it

39
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:06,800
 would be a good indicator for scientists studying the effects of pollution on plants. Exactly that's

40
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:13,120
 incredible. I never would have thought that something as small as moss could have such a big impact

41
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,320
 on our understanding of the environment. I think we need more political moss in the world children.

42
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:27,600
 Indeed I think we all do and that's it for today's episode and no such thing as a fish. Join us next

43
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,280
 week for more fascinating facts and interesting tidbits or tidbits not tidbits. Tidbits is fine.

44
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,840
 This is not in the chat beats. We should do a podcast called show us your tidbits and it's just

45
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,720
 interesting facts. That's great Britain on people's breasts. Yeah okay great. So anyway that was

46
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,560
 painful. Did we think it was realistic? It wasn't. No it wasn't because we're not that worthy. There

47
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,240
 was no mention of the word penis in there. There was no pun. I didn't see a pun anywhere. No mention

48
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,960
 of golf. No no. Could we call it a pun that it's high levels of pollution and it's talking about

49
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,160
 metaphorical pollution in the world of politics. That's really makes sense. So is political moss

50
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,520
 real or not? No it just might be. I mean the details are all here right. I think Beau Stuckey

51
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,880
 I listened to came up with the idea of political moss and then he saw what chat GPD could come up

52
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,360
 with. I did check if there was a political moss. There isn't one. There's some politicians called

53
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:31,680
 moss and there is a political word a mossback. In America that's an extreme conservative is a

54
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,600
 mossback. And the idea is that it came from when people tried to dodge the draft in the civil war.

55
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,640
 People from the Carolinas who tried to hide from the draft would call mossbacks because it was as

56
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,440
 if they were putting moss on their backs and hoping that were people go past. And then it

57
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,760
 later became a reactionaries and then it later became to mean conservatives. I'm not quite sure

58
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,360
 where the link came but that's it. Oh I like that because it's a bit like the Rolling Stone gathers

59
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,280
 no moss. You know and then you've stayed in one place for so long with all your opinions taking

60
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,960
 the same that now you've got moss on your back. It could be that yeah. Yeah it would make sense for

61
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,280
 a conservative yeah without that context is what you're saying. Yeah that's their policy. Yeah so

62
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,000
 chat GPD it's really good at certain things. As in I asked it for ideas for a birthday party

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,440
 it came up with some great suggestions. Go on. That was fine. Oh no well it was just it wasn't

64
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,480
 I didn't write them down but I just thought oh those are great ideas. Okay but you can't remember

65
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,400
 any of them. Was it sort of top of the Eiffel Tower or just tea and cake with your mum. It was

66
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,720
 more like principles behind a birthday party like invite people and you know. Oh yeah yeah yeah.

67
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,320
 Actually I think that is one of the big problems with chat what's it called chat GPD right and that

68
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,960
 is that it's really good at making things that are theoretically correct. It's good at grammar,

69
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,280
 it's good at making words that fit after each other but it doesn't necessarily think like a human

70
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,240
 thinks. So if you say to someone give me a good idea for a party they might say Pirates, Vodka,

71
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,960
 let's go to the top of the Eiffel Tower but the computer thinks you mean invite people you know.

72
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,880
 I was quite grateful for that. In fact it showed me where I've been going wrong a few years in a

73
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,240
 row now with my parties. Pirates and Vodka when is your daughter's first birthday party again?

74
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,440
 Ah there's one great thing about chat GPD which is it has um it warns you it may occasionally

75
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,360
 produce harmful instructions or biased content so it no and it's because it's broad it literally

76
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,120
 has hoovered up trillions of words from all over the internet. That's quite good isn't it because

77
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,840
 I know a lot of humans who don't realize that they're doing that. Exactly so it's aware of itself

78
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,320
 and also the other great thing about it is it has limited knowledge of world and events after 2021

79
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,800
 and I did try it I asked it who is Liz Truss and it says she's the Secretary of State for

80
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,120
 International Trade. Oh it's just a simpler time. How many of you guys have a um a smart speaker?

81
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,920
 Yeah like an Alexa thing. You've got one. Yeah yeah and I think you've got you've got a Google

82
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:00,560
 thing yeah yeah so I don't know I bet you don't. I am a smart speaker Andy. Brilliant. But no I don't

83
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,280
 have one. Okay okay that's roughly where I thought the three of you would be. Yeah yeah um do you

84
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,760
 how do you address them do you say please? No you say hey fucker. Yeah point. Play me some music

85
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:20,960
 now. It better be something I like. Okay. And come the revolution James. Goodbye.

86
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,360
 Okay well that again is broadly in line with what you'd expect because men are much less

87
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,320
 polite to their smart speakers than women. Okay. Men say please 45 percent of the time still feels

88
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,360
 quite high and women 62 percent. Yeah I don't say please I'm sorry to say. I've never said please.

89
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,400
 Well there's a school of thought which says you shouldn't say please and in fact you shouldn't

90
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,600
 teach your children to say please because you're teaching them to respect the machines and

91
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,040
 okay and there's another school of thought which says maybe we should teach them to respect the

92
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,480
 machines and Google recently it added a function called pretty please right which I find a bit

93
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,000
 sinister where if a user says please or thank you they will get a delightful response from the speaker

94
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,960
 which starts with it'll say back to you something like thanks for asking so nicely and then it'll

95
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,480
 say your answer. Oh yeah yeah but um I think you're very lonely aren't you if you need that from your

96
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,520
 Alexa. I yeah well also you don't I don't say please or thank you in the hope that someone

97
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,720
 will say thanks for asking so nicely. I think that should be a slightly nicer tone of voice

98
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,480
 it uses for you and you should get a slightly ruder tone of voice back if you don't say please

99
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,960
 or thank you I think that'll be a good way of doing it. Yeah or maybe it does things slightly worse.

100
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,960
 Exactly. The less you say please or thank you the more you ask for it to play Bell and Sebastian

101
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,880
 and it plays slipknot. Yeah it plays Bell and Sebastian but it also just spits in the middle

102
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,120
 of the song just at the good bit and it puts you off. Is this what your one person parties

103
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,640
 are like Andy? It's me and a load of speakers. They're all talking to each other. It's a social

104
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,200
 nightmare. They're all playing each other Bell and Sebastian. I'm just wandering around the room

105
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,880
 with my drink looking for someone to talk to. Bastard! Play Bastard! Come on somebody play Bastard!

106
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,560
 Do you know there's a big split in the AI world at the moment between the I guess the deep machine

107
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,280
 learning proponents which is most of what we usually talk about now so obviously you just

108
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,360
 feed it shed loads of data and it figures stuff out and then the other group call themselves

109
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:26,400
 GOFI which I just like and the GOFI is that stands for good old-fashioned AI. Oh okay.

110
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,000
 What's that? So they're the ones who think that there needs to be more of an element of programming

111
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,400
 and structure and human input and their argument is that you can only get so far with the machine

112
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,600
 learning because what AI tends to be quite bad at if you do it that way is kind of categories

113
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,600
 and hierarchies so it can get incredibly good at knowing what a cat is if you show a billion

114
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,680
 pictures of cats. You can spot a cat just by a little hair on its tail but it's not very good

115
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,120
 at knowing okay a cat's an animal and a dog's an animal so it'll see a dog and be like that's the

116
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,560
 same as a cat or an elephant and be like that's similar to a cat in the sense that it's an animal.

117
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,160
 Whereas it'd be more likely to see something which is not like a cat but has pointy ears

118
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,320
 and think well that's the same as a cat because it looks like it. Exactly yeah it's kind of like

119
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,360
 the difference between going to a foreign country and living there to learn a language

120
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,360
 and kind of being taught the grammar I suppose. I actually do think that things like babble are

121
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,520
 quite good programs for learning. You're off the clock now. No I think they're amazing.

122
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,520
 Does it feel? Elon Musk says we've got to be careful AI is going to take over. Is it dangerous?

123
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:41,280
 A. And what's I? That'll be like proclamation number one for the robots wasn't it? It's not AB

124
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:50,080
 anymore it goes A, I, BC. I've forgotten my follow-up question now. Is it is AI dangerous?

125
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:56,800
 Is it is AI dangerous? Yeah and will it make us forget things? Google what was I trying to say

126
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,280
 please? What was my second question? Actually there's obviously a lot of debate as to whether

127
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:08,560
 Elon Musk's AI is dangerous and kind of specifically in driverless cars and I read this amazing thing

128
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,640
 from a few weeks ago which I hadn't really seen covered since I went to research this but there

129
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,440
 was a famous demo video of a driverless car in 2016 which I think I remember is the one I'm

130
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,120
 thinking of and it was really well publicized, launched loads and loads of funding for driverless

131
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,480
 cars and lots of like excitement like here's what they can do and it's basically a video of a car

132
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,080
 driving driverlessly on its own autonomously and navigating traffic lights and stuff but

133
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,320
 there's a person sitting in the driver's seat and I remember we talked about this at the time I think

134
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,760
 and it says under the video the person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons

135
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,880
 he is not doing anything the car is driving itself. I remember that. Yeah engineer at Tesla's just

136
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:56,080
 come out and said he was driving the car. Oh wow. That's weird. Isn't that mad? Because I thought

137
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,800
 that in 2016 Tesla's did drive themselves for a shot you could go on to water. They could but it

138
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,040
 was doing stuff that they couldn't do at that time so for instance it was stopping at a red light.

139
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:12,400
 It was an AI that was programmed to play a video game a survival video game and they just wanted

140
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,440
 to see what would happen and it got the highest score that anyone had ever got but it got that by

141
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,640
 having lots of children and then eating them all. Okay oh my god. It's just a classic way of the AI

142
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,960
 just finds a way out that no human would ever think of doing that right. Was that a thing you

143
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,840
 could do in the game? Well they worked it out that it was a thing you could do you had to eat

144
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,920
 right and you had a way of making children and every time you ate something you got more points

145
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,680
 and so it's like well let's just keep making children. I got a fact about it seems like it's

146
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,680
 about AI but it's actually about cows. You still spoiled the ending there wasn't it? There's an AI

147
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,720
 that can eat grass and make milk. It's brilliant. So there are these smart dairy farms now right

148
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,440
 and what they the point of them is that you can assess the health of your cows the whole time

149
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,960
 by filming them right and that's it's actually more useful than having a person there watching them

150
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,600
 even if you could have a person there working you know all the time and it's because you're scanning

151
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,040
 them as they walk and you can see if they've got a bit lame right. Now the amazing fact is from

152
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,840
 the person who designed the system or co-designed it is called Melvin Smith who says that cows hide

153
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,720
 their limping when they think they're being watched because they're prey animals and if they've got

154
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,320
 a bad foot they think oh I better conceal this and they walk no I'm fine I'm fine I'm just walking.

155
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,960
 That's really interesting you know some humans like there are some humans that if you twist your ankle

156
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,880
 you'll just kind of carry on walking and you don't want anyone to know and there's some humans who

157
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,200
 make a right song and dance about it. Those ones who make a song and dance about it are the predators

158
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:53,280
 and the ones who hide it are the prey. I didn't think I was a predator before but I make such a

159
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:59,120
 fast whenever I've slightly turned an ankle or something. Shows how powerful you are. This is

160
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,600
 actually a power move and I like some peas now. That's really interesting I was chatting to someone

161
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,960
 on email for something else about an AI which has learned how to tell whether sheep are sad

162
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:19,280
 or sick or something like that and because if you look at a sheep and you look at another sheep

163
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,760
 it's really hard to tell anything about them because they just look like sheep right but there

164
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:30,000
 are very very sort of micro expressions that they have when they have saw rudders or they have you

165
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,440
 know saw feet or whatever but the AI can scan them and can tell with 80% accuracy which ones are

166
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,880
 sick and which ones aren't sick. It's like a gambling thing isn't it like if you're playing

167
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,600
 poker against a sheep you could use that. Yeah it's like a gambler's tell but I presume you could

168
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,440
 use that in poker. I presume that if you had that kind of technology you programmed it for people

169
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,360
 you could easily tell who had what in the hand of poker. I suppose it's possible that humans have

170
00:15:51,360 --> 00:16:05,920
 micro expressions. Certainly poker players think that there are certain tells that people have

171
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,800
 like maybe your your pupils slightly dilate if you've got good cards or bad cards or stuff.

172
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,880
 I don't know how to treat that. No I think most people are good at poker basically hide any

173
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,720
 semblance of that and I don't think I think AI is better you're better off making an AI that has

174
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,280
 X-ray vision to see through the cards. With the farm stuff though there's with pigs um if you

175
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,760
 get sent a photo as a farmer of your pig if it's feeling unhappy it'll be like pig number eight is

176
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:34,160
 feeling down just by the machines. Yeah by looking yeah it's incredible. Do you think the machines

177
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,240
 are trying to get the animals on their side before they're apocalypse? Oh McDonald's had a farm AI AI.

178
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,360
 Okay it is time for fact number two and that is Anna. My fact this week is that snails use trails

179
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:02,720
 like we use roads. Do they get their mucus from a shell station by any chance? Wow see it's because

180
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:10,960
 we haven't in real life where we get petrol from it's called shell as well. You are doing so well with that AI AI AI AI AI.

181
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,000
 Look anyway snails leave this slime trail which obviously we've all seen and know about

182
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,320
 and if another snail gets into that first snail slime trail and follows it it takes way way less

183
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,680
 energy for it to move and when snails are moving a huge amount of the energy that they're using goes

184
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,880
 into making this slime on which they kind of move so I think the mucus production the slime

185
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,120
 production cost of moving outweighs the metabolic cost by 35 times. Right. What does that mean?

186
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,080
 That means like you know if you're aspiring and trying to move the way we move that's the metabolic

187
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,080
 cost but then on top of that they're using 35 times more energy on just making slime to move.

188
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,080
 Basically this is why snails have never made anything of themselves it's quite tragic really.

189
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,680
 Some snails I read they spend 60 percent of their energy making mucus right and it's just

190
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,920
 there's no time. You spend so much of your life making podcasts and I don't think snails think

191
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:09,760
 much of that. That's why I've never made anything of myself. Well that's what they do they're snails

192
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,120
 they make mucus. Yeah I know but if they didn't have to make all these mucus I just wonder what

193
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,400
 kind of stuff they'd have going on. But they can as a result of the mucus yes it's a terrible amount

194
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,720
 of wasted energy when they're just trying to walk on say a flat surface but they can climb

195
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,600
 walls they can go upside down that's the purpose of it they're spider-man we're just podcasters.

196
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,600
 They're also making roads for other snails so they're you know utilitarianistically it's actually

197
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,840
 quite a good thing for them to make. Yeah you're right. Yeah but I bet there are some snails who

198
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,520
 just get dumped with all the mucus making and there are some real coasters aren't there. It's

199
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,240
 just like fucking Barry again in my mucus trail and he's literally never seen him make his own

200
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,720
 mucus. But he is you know he's doing very well for himself and the podcast is going brilliantly.

201
00:18:52,720 --> 00:19:02,000
 You rarely see a sort of you know gridlock of snails sort of traveling I always see snails

202
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,240
 sort of quite isolated and alone. I think they've got very long stopping distances on the roads

203
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,480
 much longer than us. Yeah you're right. I know I do agree with that because like if you see trails

204
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,040
 in your garden or whatever it's not like you see a trail and then you see another snail following it

205
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,840
 you don't tend to very much. True and I don't know why because the obviously they're more effective

206
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,200
 at reducing the amount of energy it takes to move on them the newer they are so if you're on a

207
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,680
 newly laid trail you know your heart you're reducing your energy levels cost by about 50

208
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,800
 percent. Yeah and that's within a day you've got to get on that trail. Right wow. If we humans had

209
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,320
 this ability you could effectively lay a trail so I could if I had my family to go out on a walk

210
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,960
 I could go like I'll go out an hour early let me just walk ahead and then they all get on.

211
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,320
 Let's go on a nice walk. Well I'll go at different times but they could catch up with me because

212
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,760
 it'd be like walking on a travel later. They'll get back to the house just as you finish your

213
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:04,480
 three hour walk. Lovely. Oh thanks darling that was really great. Great work. How are the kids?

214
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,560
 Where are the kids? I really like the fact that snails leave dotted trails this is cool sometimes

215
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,280
 they do and basically there are lots of different theories I've read about why. One is that there's

216
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,440
 there's a kind of snail called the rosy wolf snail which is a predator snail

217
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,600
 and it hunts other snails by their trails. Oh obviously if you get on the trail it just you

218
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,320
 just follow it and then you you know you eat the snail then um so that might be the reason

219
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,280
 or there's another guest that they're going over very rough terrain and it would actually

220
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,520
 require so much slime to properly slime all the ground under them that they make a little economy

221
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,400
 there and they just proceed without making slime for every bit of the ground. I like the idea that

222
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,320
 they're leaving gaps so that people can't follow them. That's a cool idea isn't it? That's a nice

223
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,520
 idea because there was a thing wasn't there last year in the news where they found some someone

224
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,960
 was smuggling snails in an airport or something and they found one snail and then they just followed

225
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,280
 his snail trail back and they found like a hundred more or something like that. That's exactly what

226
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,120
 there's giant African land snails they're absolutely mega and people import them to eat them.

227
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,280
 They're really vilified the African land snails and in fact they have a close relationship with

228
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,680
 the rosy wolf snails who I think are the most vicious snails on the planet. They're so they're

229
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:23,040
 known as cannibal snails and honestly look up a video of them eating other snails it's so frightful.

230
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:29,040
 Time lapse it must be. Yeah yeah I'll put it on at least two times speed so they'll catch up with

231
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,680
 the snail by following in its trail the rosy wolf snail. They'll sort of climb over its shell and then

232
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,640
 the snail obviously retreats back into its shell trying to get away and the rosy wolf just sticks

233
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,360
 its head. Imagine how frightening that is this huge head coming into your shell and sucks it all

234
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,560
 out. It's grotesque. This is actually a question that's been I saw it online there's a meme question

235
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,560
 the other day so the question is you can have 10 million dollars yeah 10 million quid. Oh I don't

236
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:58,800
 want this bloody Malcolm Gladwell question again. You can have 10 million quid but if you accept it

237
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,640
 there is a snail always chasing you somewhere around the world it doesn't ever stop moving

238
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,880
 it always knows where you are and it doesn't ever die. But what do you accept the money. But what

239
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:17,200
 it's a killer snail. Oh sorry I missed out the only important bit of information. And crunch

240
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:25,840
 proper. It follows the movie isn't it basically. It follows but with the snail yeah. I don't think

241
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:33,440
 I take the money. Right. No because I like peace of mind. Yeah. Couldn't you just live half the year

242
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,000
 in Australia and the other half the year in the UK. So just as he's kind of getting over the

243
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,080
 Tasman Sea you get on a plane. Is he or she a clever snail in that respect. If I boarded a flight

244
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,600
 to Australia. Oh could it board the next one. Could it board the next one. Was that what these

245
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:56,320
 guys were doing in the airport. Yeah it could yeah yeah it's a clever snail. Oh okay well that's

246
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,240
 a bit different because I think the whole point of it being a snail is it's going to take forever

247
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:07,840
 to get to you. Oh sorry and it's got legs in it rubs. And a knife. And a six foot. So yeah snails

248
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,240
 are frightening I think is what we've learned here. But actually sorry I did mention a connection

249
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,920
 between the African land snail which is a big bad guy because it's this big snail and it destroys

250
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,280
 invasive species and the rosy wool snail and that's because so in Hawaii there's loads of

251
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,160
 kind of endangered species of snail. Lots of types of tree snail and the African land snail

252
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:32,080
 rocked up and started threatening them. And so in 1955 we did the classic and we thought what we'll

253
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,760
 do is we'll introduce a bigger snail to eat the African land snail. And now I went to Hawaii a

254
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,400
 few years ago if you go there's just one massive snail. That's the island isn't it. So they introduced

255
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,120
 another bigger snail. Yeah and the it decided the rosy wool snail decided it preferred the taste

256
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,720
 of all the delicious tree snails that were really endangered to the African land snail and it's now

257
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,240
 responsible for the extinction of at least eight native species. Oh man. We've got to stop doing

258
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,880
 that. We've got to stop it. So some um winkles kind of snail um that you can read the slime trails of

259
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,080
 other snails and then get all sorts of data from the slime the sex the species the direction it was

260
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,480
 going and how attractive it is as a mate. From its slime. Yeah and if you're a lady snail and you're

261
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:22,080
 free of parasites which is to a male there's a base basically the Benny Hill show happens where

262
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,320
 you've got a load of male snails chasing you and this happens so much that there are some they're

263
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,360
 called rough periwinkles. The females they can change the composition of their slime and basically

264
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,120
 turn on a cloaking mode where to hide their parasites they would hide the sex oh they leave

265
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,120
 a sex neutral trail because they've got so many bloody male rough periwinkles chasing after them.

266
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,320
 Oh really? I'm not interested and so they change the slime. How cool is that? That's clever. Yeah

267
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,400
 that's amazing. Yeah like a phone box like a sticker in a phone box your snail is a snail trail.

268
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,480
 I didn't know I was just trying to think what the human equivalent is of leaving a trail behind you

269
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,880
 advertising how sexy you are. Oh those things in the phone boxes. Yeah it's a dated reference. I

270
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,840
 don't think the way they work is you go to one phone box and they say right now to the next phone

271
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,760
 box and you keep going down the phone boxes until you eventually reach the prostitute. I think that's

272
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:20,240
 how it works isn't it? More and more clues every time one more number added to the phone number.

273
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,200
 She's been here. She doesn't then conceal her trail by leaving a gender neutral card in a phone

274
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,960
 box. No no she doesn't not that kind of. What an average time. We should move on in a sec.

275
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,600
 I just have some things on slime that I quite like. Do you know that to most of the inhabitants

276
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,160
 of the ocean? The ocean is slime. It's thick and viscous. Slimy, viscous. Slimy. What's official

277
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,200
 things? This to think smaller than fish so I think to like plankton and microbes and I don't think we

278
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,880
 know how it actually feels to them but basically this was an article there's a new scientist in

279
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,040
 the year 2000 so maybe it's been completely disproven but basically they found out that

280
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,680
 there are way more sugar molecules in the seawater than we thought there were. It's like this whole

281
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,520
 mesh of sort of saccharide molecules and they trap water in their mesh and that creates this kind

282
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,200
 of gel and it's cobwebby it described it as and so if you're a small animal going through that

283
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,000
 because you're so tiny that feels like really thick and viscous and we think it must feel

284
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,880
 like that to them because if you look at how microorganisms are distributed in the sea or

285
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,840
 like plankton or tiny things they're not evenly distributed or randomly distributed they're sort

286
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,960
 of in clusters because I guess some bits are thicker than others in this weird cobweb and so

287
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,560
 they can't plow through them. So you're just a little kind of bit of plankton going down the sea

288
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,920
 you can't really swim because you're plankton that's the whole point of plankton but then

289
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,800
 occasionally you just get to a bit and you're like 'oh great this is all slimy now' yeah do you mean

290
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,240
 great sarcastically yeah yeah yeah but can you climb through the water if you're plankton you can't

291
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,520
 do anything you're just whatever the current happens yeah whatever happens happens no wonder

292
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:19,520
 they've evolved sarcasm is the most powerful weapon okay it is time for fact number three

293
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:26,240
 and that is James okay my fact this week is that italy's defense minister was once hospitalised

294
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:33,600
 for smoking 150 cigarettes in a day. Was it a challenge? What was it? Was it a competition?

295
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,240
 I think he was very stressed it was during an election in 2013 this is a guy called Guido Cressetto

296
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,480
 and anyone who follows Italian politics will know that quite recently the brothers of Italy have

297
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:53,120
 have won an election or become the biggest party and they formed a government and they're kind of

298
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:01,360
 like the eukipi nationalist party of Italy and Guido who I think was the leader of brothers of

299
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:09,600
 Italy at the time in 2013 he was electioneering and apparently had one cigarette every six minutes

300
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,640
 from 8 a.m to 11 p.m and started feeling not very well and had to go to hospital wow but then

301
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,200
 after a few days he was fine okay what does that do to you that level of intensity what did they

302
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,920
 diagnose him with well he felt that it was stress related as well I think that oh yeah

303
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:34,240
 so do you um do you drink oh I just have a sherry at Christmas do you smoke well you know just

304
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,320
 just 150 a day just every six minutes yeah I think definitely the stress thing though and I live

305
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,560
 quite near a main road so can I unpack the six minute thing though because is that including

306
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:52,160
 is that post finishing a cigarette with a six minute break no so every six minutes he would

307
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,440
 have had to have started and ended for the mouth to work how was it just my cigarette a few minutes

308
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,920
 you have to go quite quite quickly to get through one in three or four minutes he might not have got

309
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,920
 to the to the filter in all of them right right yeah because you're busy it's stressful you're

310
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,320
 campaigning here I tried to find any evidence anyone had ever smoked more than this in a day

311
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,560
 and I don't know if you guys found Stefan Sigmund oh yeah right but he's called Sigmund oh yeah

312
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:22,800
 cool yeah wow Stefan Sigmund Sigmund Sigmund yeah yeah yeah it's close enough anyway in 1996 what he

313
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,520
 did he um he was trying to get a Guinness World Record apparently and it's there are some people

314
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,720
 who say it didn't happen but there is a photo of him doing it okay he jammed 800 cigarettes into a

315
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,520
 wheel rigged them all up to a pipe yeah and smoked 800 cigarettes in six minutes yeah and it was a

316
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,040
 rotating wheel and the idea was that he'd be able to get a little bit of all the cigarettes the people

317
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,280
 who said I think it definitely happened that I think most people who say that it didn't happen

318
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,120
 were are more saying that he couldn't have got much from the ones on the outside of the wheel

319
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,160
 oh yeah yeah that surely wasn't accepted as well Guinness said it was not environmentally friendly

320
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,280
 yeah well one good reason why it's not but no it's yeah I read a newspaper article about him

321
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,560
 because at the same time as doing this he also ate 29 hard boiled eggs in four minutes

322
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:17,280
 and he leaped into a lake from 135 foot cliff all in order to get into the Guinness Book of Records

323
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,480
 but Carol Jones a Guinness spokesperson said we do discourage this sort of thing

324
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,200
 and suggested that he tried the record for collecting cigarettes instead of smoking them

325
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:33,280
 okay so yeah I wonder if he got any I wonder if he holds any for any of those events because it sounds

326
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,520
 these ones that he did it was almost like an advert because it was in quite a lot of newspapers

327
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,720
 during the day and it was almost like it was an advert for Guinness saying don't do these stupid

328
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,160
 things because you won't get in the Guinness Book of Records because it like listed a few

329
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,600
 things you couldn't get records for that's mad I was just looking at tips for quitting if you're

330
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,560
 the 150 a day kind of person and I just came across an article that I really enjoyed in the

331
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,280
 Guardian because it asked for other people's ways that they'd found quit smoking when the

332
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,080
 normal stuff didn't work and so if the patches and the gum haven't worked for you here's what some

333
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,120
 people recommend there was Pete who got all I thought you were going to say you smoked peter

334
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:18,320
 instead but bury yourself in it yeah yeah and on top of that you won't be drafted into the war

335
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:25,440
 it's a win-win situation sorry Anna peter peter peter yes he had all of his teeth removed

336
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,280
 he smoked for about 40 years and he went to the dentist and said stop you from being able to

337
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,880
 smoke because I did that not that on its own but he had them take out all of his smoking yellow

338
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,440
 teeth and then he had them all replaced with fake teeth which look really good and then he was like

339
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,800
 well I don't do anything to damage these fake teeth that's a good idea yeah incentivizing like a great

340
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:51,840
 way to quit um pull out all your teeth well there's okay here's a different method then

341
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,600
 because they do a lot obviously the warnings on the packet and then I think some countries have

342
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,600
 considered warnings on each individual cigarette in case you haven't got the message from the

343
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,480
 pictures on the packet which you've seen your mouth you can't read it unless you could create

344
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:13,520
 a cigarette that gives smoke signals but say stop smoking that's good like Gandalf kind of breathing

345
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:21,680
 out that shit but he'd breathe out a picture of a diseased lung the director's cut yeah yeah yeah

346
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,440
 um well they kind of so in 2013 there were some researchers at sterling who kind of did this

347
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,920
 they made a packet of cigarettes which shouted at you when you opened the packet it played an

348
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:39,360
 audio clip warning about the dangers of smoking I think that's quite good yeah I have a um I've got

349
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:46,000
 a musical biscuit tin do you yeah yeah and does it say stop eating biscuits fat so it was it was

350
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,840
 a Christmas present and I'm still still working my way through it because it's loads of biscuits in it

351
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,080
 but every time you open it it's very hard not to play a bit of the tune because you move it just

352
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,960
 you know you move it and it's quite delicate and so and it does it's more made me stealthy about

353
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,440
 opening the tin because I don't want I don't want to give away the fact that I'm um yeah yeah eating

354
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,320
 biscuits that's kind of clever I don't want my neighbors to hear and come over and say hey can I

355
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,160
 have a biscuit you know well so you think you're going to be like an ice cream man your neighbors are

356
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:18,560
 going to hear a song of biscuits very close to my neighbors with great friends but you know you've

357
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,800
 got to keep keep some things private you've got to have some boundaries yeah I think that's one of

358
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,880
 them um I've just one guessing game for just one other way to quit smoking yeah one woman said

359
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,320
 convert from when you're drinking tea convert from mugs to a cup and saucer she said this is what

360
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,880
 made her quit so she would have had a ciggy with a mug of tea very good yeah but it's good to put

361
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,920
 your cigarette in the saucer because you've got something to rest on it's like a mini ashtray

362
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:48,640
 yep um a mug a mug what's the difference does the mug have like because they can have writing

363
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:57,600
 on them does it say mmm a lovely fag she only had pro smoking mugs yeah they used to do big

364
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,360
 business in them I actually think she might be using a cup and saucer differently to how we

365
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,920
 might use one for this to work oh she holds them in both hands and you got this third hand free

366
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,280
 beauty that's clever that's the object of a cup and saucer she got rid of all the tables in her house

367
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:19,840
 so she had to hold them she moved to a mountainous region with no flat surfaces at all just one

368
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:26,160
 cup one saucer it was a huge sacrifice actually she only spoke one a week right that's amazing so

369
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,880
 there's a big movement these days obviously for trying to stop people from smoking almost all

370
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:36,800
 together so a lot of people on top of that are trying to erase their relationship with cigarettes

371
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,640
 particularly for big companies um so the example I have Walt Disney Walt Disney supposedly used to

372
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,280
 smoke about three packs of ciggies a day and if you used to go around Walt Disney World uh Disney

373
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,080
 World you would see pictures of him holding cigarettes and so many shots it's just he's

374
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:57,280
 got a ciggy in his hand and what they've done is they've photoshopped out every single cigarette

375
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,920
 that's ever found in a photo of Walt Disney at Disneyland so wherever you go the photo is

376
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,920
 still the same photo but the cigarette is now missing do they put something else in his hand

377
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,840
 no they don't so that's the thing you've got this weird little point thing make it a pencil

378
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:15,280
 yeah so easy what they've done instead is every member of staff is trained to do the Walt Disney

379
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,560
 point with their two fingers so that normalizes it yeah and this is even used in the movie where

380
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,320
 Tom Hanks plays Walt Disney with the the Mary Poppins movie that was done yeah it looks a bit

381
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,840
 like he's doing gun fingers it does gun fingers doesn't it all like you're swearing at someone if

382
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,160
 you leave a gap a cigarette exactly if you have a tiny gap but so members of staff are specifically

383
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,040
 trained to do the Walt Disney point which he never did because he had a ciggy in it and when when do

384
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,400
 you do it do they tell you when to do it or is it just every five minutes you have to do it three

385
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,480
 times I think probably if you're pointing somewhere maybe it's just over there maybe um if you're a

386
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:54,400
 bit stressed after sex yeah with a cup of tea um so cigarettes don't smell very nice to a lot of

387
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,720
 people agreed yeah they smell pretty horrible to a lot of people agree to a lot I suppose it

388
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,480
 depends if you're a smoker yeah yeah okay but have you heard of nice cigarettes these are these

389
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,400
 were launched in 1989 um they were called the that wasn't the official brand name I can't remember

390
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,240
 the official brand name but it was basically the first cigarette to smell good was the idea

391
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,880
 and it was they burned with a vanilla smell and they were advertised under the slogan

392
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,640
 you shouldn't have to leave the room you shouldn't have to apologize oh yeah well that's just gonna

393
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,280
 smell like a vape which I must say I'm not a big fan of either well it's sold terribly and they like

394
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,760
 there have been a few attempts but they were all the kind of proto vape things so premier smokeless

395
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,440
 cigarettes was another kind they were tested in 1989 um and smokers didn't like them well customers

396
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,600
 who tried it complained that it smelled bad lack flavor and it was too hot to touch and industry

397
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:52,640
 experts noted that it could also be used to smoke crack so it didn't make it off the testing line

398
00:36:52,640 --> 00:37:00,480
 really right yeah but apart from that doesn't think smokers like the smell and taste of cigarettes

399
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,880
 and have never liked stuff that doesn't really taste like it really except the occasional eccentric

400
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,280
 smoker who used to smoke some menthol cigarettes um just lest we think that smoking is on its way

401
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,600
 out asap it's going up worldwide in terms of number of smokers and that is related to the

402
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:24,800
 population going out but still it's the biggest cause of preventable deaths in the world and by

403
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,720
 quite a long way because I actually didn't look up the second biggest but I always sort of like

404
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,240
 things like car crashes are really big and other things are around alcohol even like I wonder how

405
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,920
 I wonder if they can measure alcohol yeah you can you've got nails that following you around for

406
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,400
 your 10 million quid that's actually ironically hot on the heels of smoking the whole point of

407
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,440
 that is it's not preventable that's like literally you just can't stop leading inevitable cause of

408
00:37:51,440 --> 00:38:00,640
 death obviously smoking has been banned in various places over the years and in new york it was banned

409
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:11,200
 in 1908 smoking but only for women really yeah um on ladylike pretty much yeah pretty much that

410
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,480
 they hadn't invented that Audrey Hepburn long cigarette absolutely that came down later yeah

411
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:23,200
 it was a very short-lived ban basically in 1907 there was a cafe a very trendy cafe in new york

412
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,880
 that allowed women to smoke because usually people women didn't really smoke in in public very much

413
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,840
 because it was seen as un-ladylike but this bar decided actually we don't care about that anyone

414
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,640
 could smoke if they want and then it was really really popular and so a load of other bars started

415
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,000
 to let women smoke in there and the politicians didn't like it there was a um politician called

416
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,680
 timothy little tim sullivan and he decided that he was going to ban smoking even though he had

417
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:58,560
 personally never seen a woman smoke right he still decided he was going to ban it and they did ban it

418
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,720
 and there was only one woman katie mulcahi uh who was the only person who was cited for violating

419
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,880
 the crime uh because a few weeks later the mayor of new york fee told it said actually this is

420
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,640
 ridiculous we're going to stop this really for two weeks and for one woman in new york it was

421
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,840
 illegal that's cool for katie i bet that i got her a good reputation i reckon did you guys see

422
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,680
 we were just mentioning Audrey Hepburn had you know those those beautiful what would they call

423
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,080
 it holders the cigarette holders yeah did you see the inventions of robert stone who this is in

424
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:36,000
 the 1950s he just tried to come up with new and innovative ways to make smoking a more pleasurable

425
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,200
 experience um so he invented these holders there was one brilliant one where it was for if it was

426
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,560
 raining and you wanted to have a ciggy um it had just a little umbrella that hangs over the cigarette

427
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,040
 itself off the back of its holder yeah it looked really really clever there was the periscope

428
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,120
 ciggy which would go upwards um no no specific purpose as far as i can see uh for the periscope

429
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,200
 ciggy if you're in a submarine and you want a fag what do you do because you can't go outside

430
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:10,880
 yes but you had a massive pipe going up there well we didn't see the approaching warship um

431
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,640
 because perkins was using the periscope have a quick gasper ironically they found us through

432
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:25,200
 the lit tip of the cigarette um actually weirdly until 2010 you could smoke in a submarine as well

433
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,360
 oh yeah yeah it was yeah there was there was a room there was a smokers room in submarines and

434
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,080
 you could smoke down there spaces at a premium on submarines yes yeah it's amazing how geared

435
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,600
 everything was towards smokers needed spaces interesting so many people smoke yeah interesting

436
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,200
 thing is the beetles had a white submarine but it just got stained by all the nicotine

437
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:53,840
 okay it's time for our final fact of the show and that's my fact my fact this week is that actually

438
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:59,520
 we've all been pronouncing covrant garden wrong okay come on dan all right what are you on about

439
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,960
 everyone or have you been doing it right all along i've been doing it wrong as well a different

440
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,640
 kind of wrong different kind of wrong still wrong so i was looking into covrant garden i love where

441
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,000
 we work i love this area it's it's full of incredible historical significance and while

442
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,440
 looking into it i discovered that the word is actually a bastardization of the word convent

443
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,800
 it should be convent garden that's how this started the very first mention that was ever made of

444
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:33,520
 convent garden was in the 1200s and um it was uh in reference to the fact that this area was a lot

445
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,760
 of it was garden and for westminster abbey they had lots of vegetables and so on here so this is

446
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,080
 prior to the big market and the reason it became a market that's almost a but wait you've you've

447
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:47,680
 explained why the garden bit's pronounced garden but um the convent bit is it the garden of a

448
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,120
 convent right yeah it was garden of a convent there were lots of monks here and so on and they

449
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,760
 were running it and so it was known as convent garden this was basically a big old monastery

450
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,120
 around here that wasn't kind of attached to westminster abbey which is not that close to here

451
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,680
 which makes you think wonder how that works but actually a load of monks lived here and it was

452
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,480
 the dissolution of the monasteries famously under henry the eighth that sold it all off and then it

453
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,920
 became what it is today yeah is it i think i read this too long ago to be absolutely sure of it now

454
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,480
 but basically this was quite under under populated bit of london because there were two main bits

455
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,520
 of london which were the westminster you know cedar power and that was the city yeah which is

456
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,720
 over further east and actually the bit in between was not really populated at all not really it was

457
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,800
 this sort of two bit system and yeah i think it definitely went down population wise like it was

458
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,040
 a thing about the eighth ninth century then it went down and then it came up again but i think

459
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,760
 technically dan you could argue you've been pronouncing it more right than us really well

460
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:52,720
 you're pronouncing it with an extra r yeah and what is r except half of an n in covent garden

461
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,880
 he puts the r towards the end of the word covent don't you yeah yeah is there any other covent

462
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:05,280
 do you get covent anywhere else coventry yeah should that have been coventry oh my god yeah

463
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,760
 or was it a place where witches lived mm-hmm coventry the coventry yeah and that's why

464
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:18,880
 Hitler went for it yeah didn't like the witches yeah famously fair enough um not fair enough

465
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,560
 my grandma lived in coventry we won't be tired in coventry anytime soon then

466
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,400
 um yeah com god market was is the main thing that com god was famous for wasn't it yeah for

467
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,320
 centuries and um oh man it was so interesting such a cool time what period are we talking

468
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:46,160
 oh centuries which particular centuries i think it started being officially a market in 1670

469
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,320
 didn't it but it had been used the market before that okay and in fact still is today if you if you

470
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,560
 wander out into the market from the office you'll find it's not your big fruit and veg it's not the

471
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,760
 biggest fruit and veg market in the country anymore like it was from whatever year around i

472
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,040
 said it was um but they sell knock off football jerseys yeah that's true and those are sort of

473
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,720
 the vegetables of today are they yeah um but the market porters were a huge thing and um

474
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,280
 there's amazing footage as footage from the kind of 20s and 30s of them carrying stacks of the

475
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,560
 baskets on their heads because that was how everything was transported in the market

476
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,080
 and they were slightly domed in the base so they fit on your head very neatly and they

477
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:25,600
 stacked really well and have you heard of basket jim basket jim he's had a person it's a person he

478
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,760
 was called jim sainsbury i don't know if any relation but he worked at the common garden

479
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:36,080
 market in the 1920s and 30s and there's footage of him doing 25 baskets in a stack on his head wow

480
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,320
 that's like the stuff in the baskets yeah i don't know if they're full or not i think maybe for the

481
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,160
 show for display purposes they might have been empty yeah yeah that's still a lot though isn't

482
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,560
 it's the balance is the main thing yeah yeah it must be a different family otherwise surely sainsbury's

483
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:55,280
 baskets would have that head shape if you walk around sainsbury's now i think you have to put it

484
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,360
 on you do you know the first sainsbury's was in covent garden really interesting enough yeah it's

485
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:07,440
 on the dreary lane just down the road from here uh and they sold like um what was it called railway

486
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,480
 milk that was their big seller it wasn't disgusting you have to get up so early in the morning to see

487
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,240
 the trains being milked but it's a beautiful site the idea was that it came from like devon and

488
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:24,640
 cornwall but it came on the railway so it's still fresh okay right the square was built for the

489
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:31,200
 fourth earl of bedford by inigo jones the famous architect for international listeners inigo jones

490
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,520
 i always feel sorry for because he's gone down in history as not christopher wren essentially

491
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,680
 in in england wouldn't you say he's basically the the other architect that's not christopher wren

492
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:45,040
 yeah he was very famous architect yeah but he's just the second most famous architect sure he was

493
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,440
 i'm sorry inigo i just wanted to say oh fair enough christopher wren who designed st paul's

494
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,640
 cathedral we should also say for international listeners yes i don't think christopher wren is

495
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,840
 that famous outside the uk either no or in the uk to be honest and inigo jones is less famous than

496
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:03,600
 him but still very cool and has a cooler name as well yeah well he he actually has a less um

497
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:09,840
 fun name than one of the people he worked with so he was um he worked under james first and

498
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:17,040
 charles the first uh alongside the official royal stone master uh who was called nicholas stone

499
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:24,240
 nice amazing really good stone master yeah the stone master what would the stone master do

500
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,480
 well he would have worked with stone he would have worked with was he he was nicking stone he was a

501
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:36,160
 sculptor for sure so nicking it isn't nicholas nicks stone very good yeah and inigo jones was

502
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,800
 more famous no less famous but quite famous for being the first person to do a survey of stone

503
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:48,960
 hench speaking of stone that's cool yeah but he did say that it was a roman temple which it wasn't

504
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,640
 right and that's why he's only the second most famous because christopher wren would have got

505
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,960
 that straight away he loved roman stuff um actually the sad thing another sad thing about

506
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,240
 inigo jones is that um the main thing he had to do really in this square he was asked to build a

507
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,920
 square fit for gentlemen with ability uh by the ear of bed for the ability of being able to carry

508
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,200
 baskets on your head yeah just for the basket carriers yeah and the living statues no it's

509
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,880
 basically for really posh rich people and so the only thing they wanted they wanted a completely

510
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,760
 bare square so it was the first time london had had this a huge expanse with nothing in the middle

511
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:29,120
 so you know you could prom not about it and then with a church in it and it was st paul's and the

512
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:35,200
 church still is st paul's so christopher wren designed st paul's cathedral big f off uh beautiful

513
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,200
 cathedral down the road and then he designed little st paul's church on covent garden that's

514
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:47,040
 still there today but st paul's covent garden is better in some ways in some ways because it's uh

515
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:55,280
 it's a reverse church it's a reverse it's where god comes to worship me yeah right yeah it's um

516
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:01,200
 yeah the church authorities aren't very happy about it actually uh a bit sacrilegious but it's

517
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,560
 no it's uh it's a wrong way church isn't it it's a wrong way around church because what do you mean

518
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,560
 well basically churches have their doors at the west end and then the east end is the bit that

519
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:14,720
 faces towards jerusalem that's how churches are laid out yeah right yeah okay yeah that's just

520
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,800
 there's how churches are but he because he wanted the doors to open onto the piazzas was the first

521
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,240
 ever piazza that we were going to have in the uk very exciting he wanted these huge great double

522
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,600
 doors so he built them like that and then the church said absolutely not you're going to have

523
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,960
 the altar at the east end and you're going to have the door at the west end like normal and so the

524
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,920
 doors are kind of false doors but and then there's a real door yeah that makes so much sense because

525
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,640
 the back looks so much like a front kind of thing with that church it's a bit confusing yeah it's a

526
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,920
 reversive person church so do all churches face jerusalem not all of them but the idea is that they

527
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,680
 face east because that's where you're looking and that's where you know when you're praying you're

528
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,680
 you're sitting in church facing the front you're facing towards jerusalem if you're ever lost yeah

529
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:57,920
 in a town go to the church whichever way it faces just walk in that direction if i'm on my way to

530
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:04,560
 jerusalem you'll get to jerusalem yeah i'm the squeezy jiff lemon there we go to covent garden

531
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,960
 squeezy jiff lemon sorry there's a lemon juice product called jiff and it comes in a bottle

532
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,880
 that looks like a lemon it was invented by a man called edward hack in 1957 um not his not an

533
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,720
 original idea but no no that was that's just a joke um supposedly he he looked at the whole every

534
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,200
 lemon there was in harrods and sulfur it is of fortnum and masons and then he looked at 900

535
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,720
 individual lemons at covent garden to find the perfect lemon to base his oh i see because it's

536
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,480
 in the shape of a lemon it's in the shape of a lemon okay yeah i thought you're gonna say you

537
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,040
 looked at them all and made an average of all of those shapes no i think you just found one

538
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:44,400
 unbelievably nice lemon the flawless lemon i must admit i don't actually find any one lemon more

539
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:51,040
 attractive than any other lemon but that's just me uh james you've got no heart yeah there was a

540
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:58,240
 place called the rose tavern which i think was the best place to hang out in the 1700s and um it was

541
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:06,640
 where criminals highwaymen prostitutes or but then actors poets artists samuel peep spent a lot of

542
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:13,600
 time there he said he really liked the food are you going to the brothel against samuel no no no

543
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:19,920
 i'm going for the sausage rolls fish and chips is honestly done i just like that simple pub grub

544
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,760
 and the topless woman who serves it to me um there's rose street up there is it there

545
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,520
 i think it might be because i think it is still there rose street and then just off of

546
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,000
 there's some floral passage or something yeah yeah floral lane or something probably okay and

547
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,880
 they handed the people who sort of performed there had amazing tricks so there were topless

548
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,240
 women would wrestle there um there's a there's a thing and you could put bets on it it employed

549
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:50,080
 lots of posture moles which i'd never heard of but posture moles i don't think you're gonna

550
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:55,760
 guess what this is well it's obvious isn't it you dig down a hole into someone's garden

551
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,880
 and then when you come out you sit straight oh it's like this um like the conductor ethyl

552
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,280
 smith tying herself to a tree to improve posture okay i don't think it would have got as much

553
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,200
 custom in the pub if it was your version but it would have been closer to mole is a is a is a

554
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,320
 is a prostitute of some kind oh mole i see yeah oh because i heard that posture women was a nickname

555
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,720
 for the uh the women playing the trade it probably is the same maybe it's posture moles posture women

556
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,920
 but these people uh used to emphasize that they were not prostitutes but what they did was they

557
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,160
 would be paid by the cleontel your samuel peeps is either to be flogged or to flog them

558
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:34,880
 one of those in public in front of people in the pub in public yeah oh yeah i know sexy that is

559
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,720
 saucy well i guess a strip club these days it's all in the open isn't it as well they don't have

560
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:48,400
 a cast of nine tails don't always ask for the whipping it's been 300 years okay sorry um but

561
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,160
 the way they advertise who they were to say you know i'll whip you if you want was they would lie

562
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:00,240
 naked on a table and a waiter would bring a lit candle on a tray over to them and they would

563
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,440
 simulate kind of having sex with it with the climax being that they would snuff the candle

564
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,640
 out so wait a minute until that had happened you just think it's a normal naked woman lying on

565
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,960
 your table and then as soon as she blows out the candle having pretended to have sex with it you're

566
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:21,440
 like oh you're a prostitute exactly you're not you weren't just passing and felt like a lie down

567
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,960
 it's a bit like when you go to tji fridays and you tell them it's your birthday

568
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:34,320
 they do that in some branches no one's oh they've told them it's my birthday they're gonna do the

569
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:43,600
 thing that are so embarrassing he's only six that was not what chat gpt suggested is a good idea

570
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:49,920
 for a party are you saying they snuffed out the candle i think with uh yeah yeah with with the

571
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:55,440
 the nether regions apparently they lie me in fact the the quote was snuff out the candle in a highly

572
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,640
 obscene and hazardous manner to rows of approval from her audience because it's quite you know like

573
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,160
 if you have a candle and you manage to put it out with your fingers because you lick your fingers

574
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:09,440
 yes it's a bit like that is i always feel really hard when i do that like danny die or a rustle

575
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,160
 cry well imagine doing that with your funny oh maybe it's sort of like a downstairs sneeze

576
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,040
 possible

577
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:24,560

579
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:39,360
 all the lights honey pick up pick up a naked woman to slowly dip her over every single

580
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:50,560

585
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:19,520
 canada furious peat very nice um tji fridays was mentioned a second ago uh there's a road called

586
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:25,440
 maiden lane and right at the bottom of maiden lane on one end opposite on the corner of bedford

587
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,880
 street there is a building there and if you look up on the building you'll see a plaque and that

588
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,360
 plaque reads that charles dickens used to live here in the workhouse when he was a young boy

589
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:40,000
 and i was looking into it and that building was it was a sort of a working house and he used to

590
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,600
 work downstairs putting black polish into tins and you know you would sell that and i'm pretty sure

591
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,760
 it's where there used to be a tji fridays on the bottom there was there was yeah that's that would

592
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,520
 have been the spot where charles dickens as a young man was put in the front window of the building

593
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:00,080
 because what they used to like to show was how boot polish was going in fresh so it looked like

594
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:04,480
 you're getting the best sort of stuff and he was he would sit in the window with his best friend

595
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,440
 at the time and they would both do it together and his best friend was called fagin so fagin and

596
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,160
 dickens used to sit in the window doing the same right and that became a tji fridays and that became

597
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,400
 a tji fridays and it's what he would have wanted it was the best of foods it was the worst of foods

598
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,560
 predominantly the latter

599
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:27,280
