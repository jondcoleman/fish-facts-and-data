00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everybody, just before we start this week's show we've got an exciting announcement to make"
00:00:05,00:00:11,"and that is that our half-sister show, our sort of semi-sibling show,"
00:00:11,00:00:17,"the Museum of Curiosity, is coming back! Absolutely, it's a show on BBC Radio 4,"
00:00:17,00:00:25,it takes place on Mondays starting from the 20th of February at 6.30 in the evening and even more
00:00:25,00:00:34,"excitingly our half-podcast sister Anna Tyshinski is starring in this year's series. Yes, that's"
00:00:34,00:00:40,"exactly right. The show is hosted by John Lloyd, the father of QI, it's a sort of fictional museum"
00:00:40,00:00:45,and imaginary museum and every week they have brilliant guests submitting strange and wonderful
00:00:45,00:00:51,and imaginary objects to the museum. John is the director of the museum and Anna this series is
00:00:51,00:00:56,"going to be the curator so that's really exciting. Absolutely, if you love NoSix Things A Fish and"
00:00:56,00:01:02,if you love QI you will absolutely love Museum of Curiosity and just to remind you it's on Monday
00:01:02,00:01:09,"the 20th of February at 6.30 and for the subsequent six weeks. Okay, on with the podcast! On with the show!"
00:01:09,00:01:30,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:01:30,00:01:36,"from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:01:36,00:01:40,Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones
00:01:40,00:01:46,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting
00:01:46,00:01:54,with fact number one and that is Andy. My fact is that there's a type of moss called political
00:01:54,00:02:02,"moss. Jesus, is there? Yeah, well that's a great question Dan, no there isn't. What? Thank you for"
00:02:02,00:02:06,"bringing it to the show. No wait a minute, your fact is that there isn't a type of moss called"
00:02:06,00:02:11,"political moss. So what this fact is, that phrase ""there's a type of moss called political moss"""
00:02:11,00:02:16,"is something that a listener got in touch with, okay, a listener called Beau Stuckey"
00:02:16,00:02:24,and he had been in touch with chat GPT which is a newish kind of artificial intelligence
00:02:24,00:02:28,conversation bot basically that's one of the most powerful ever created but in fact I think
00:02:28,00:02:31,"might be the most powerful ever created. A time of recording. Yeah, exactly, I mean if you're"
00:02:31,00:02:36,listening to this after the revolution it's the second most powerful ever created and if you're
00:02:36,00:02:41,scurrying through rat holes and you know like eating old packaged food and fleeing the robots
00:02:41,00:02:47,then yeah anyway but chat GPT is currently best in show and he asked chat GPT to come up with an
00:02:47,00:02:52,episode of Fish about that fact of political moss and it came up with I would say a pretty good
00:02:53,00:02:58,transcript. Okay yeah do you think? Yeah well can we can we read the transcript and just see how
00:02:58,00:03:01,it sounds? You've passed them around to all of us so it feels like we've got no choice.
00:03:01,00:03:09,"Okay so everyone has a name here except me, I'm a host I guess. Okay welcome back to the show"
00:03:09,00:03:15,"which we never say. No. Welcome back to the show, I'm your host Dan. With me today we have James,"
00:03:15,00:03:21,Anna and Andy. So Andy what do you have for us today? Well I've got a real doozy. Did you know
00:03:21,00:03:26,there's a type of moss called political moss? Political moss? That sounds like something out of
00:03:26,00:03:32,a dystopian novel. No no no it's a real thing. Apparently it was discovered in the 1800s by a
00:03:32,00:03:38,botanist named William Jackson Hooker and get this it's called political moss because it prefers
00:03:38,00:03:44,"to grow in areas with high levels of pollution. Hey funny, funny chat GPT. Sorry I've gone off"
00:03:44,00:03:51,script. I'm so sorry. Right back in the game. Wow that's really interesting so it's like a canary
00:03:51,00:03:58,in a coal mine for environmental pollution. Yeah I can see how that would make sense and I bet it
00:03:58,00:04:06,would be a good indicator for scientists studying the effects of pollution on plants. Exactly that's
00:04:06,00:04:13,incredible. I never would have thought that something as small as moss could have such a big impact
00:04:13,00:04:18,on our understanding of the environment. I think we need more political moss in the world children.
00:04:18,00:04:27,Indeed I think we all do and that's it for today's episode and no such thing as a fish. Join us next
00:04:27,00:04:35,week for more fascinating facts and interesting tidbits or tidbits not tidbits. Tidbits is fine.
00:04:35,00:04:41,This is not in the chat beats. We should do a podcast called show us your tidbits and it's just
00:04:41,00:04:48,interesting facts. That's great Britain on people's breasts. Yeah okay great. So anyway that was
00:04:48,00:04:54,painful. Did we think it was realistic? It wasn't. No it wasn't because we're not that worthy. There
00:04:54,00:05:00,was no mention of the word penis in there. There was no pun. I didn't see a pun anywhere. No mention
00:05:00,00:05:04,of golf. No no. Could we call it a pun that it's high levels of pollution and it's talking about
00:05:04,00:05:10,metaphorical pollution in the world of politics. That's really makes sense. So is political moss
00:05:10,00:05:15,real or not? No it just might be. I mean the details are all here right. I think Beau Stuckey
00:05:15,00:05:18,I listened to came up with the idea of political moss and then he saw what chat GPD could come up
00:05:18,00:05:23,with. I did check if there was a political moss. There isn't one. There's some politicians called
00:05:23,00:05:31,moss and there is a political word a mossback. In America that's an extreme conservative is a
00:05:31,00:05:37,mossback. And the idea is that it came from when people tried to dodge the draft in the civil war.
00:05:38,00:05:42,People from the Carolinas who tried to hide from the draft would call mossbacks because it was as
00:05:42,00:05:47,if they were putting moss on their backs and hoping that were people go past. And then it
00:05:47,00:05:53,later became a reactionaries and then it later became to mean conservatives. I'm not quite sure
00:05:53,00:05:57,where the link came but that's it. Oh I like that because it's a bit like the Rolling Stone gathers
00:05:57,00:06:01,no moss. You know and then you've stayed in one place for so long with all your opinions taking
00:06:01,00:06:04,the same that now you've got moss on your back. It could be that yeah. Yeah it would make sense for
00:06:04,00:06:09,a conservative yeah without that context is what you're saying. Yeah that's their policy. Yeah so
00:06:09,00:06:14,chat GPD it's really good at certain things. As in I asked it for ideas for a birthday party
00:06:14,00:06:19,it came up with some great suggestions. Go on. That was fine. Oh no well it was just it wasn't
00:06:19,00:06:24,I didn't write them down but I just thought oh those are great ideas. Okay but you can't remember
00:06:24,00:06:30,any of them. Was it sort of top of the Eiffel Tower or just tea and cake with your mum. It was
00:06:30,00:06:36,more like principles behind a birthday party like invite people and you know. Oh yeah yeah yeah.
00:06:36,00:06:42,Actually I think that is one of the big problems with chat what's it called chat GPD right and that
00:06:42,00:06:46,"is that it's really good at making things that are theoretically correct. It's good at grammar,"
00:06:46,00:06:51,it's good at making words that fit after each other but it doesn't necessarily think like a human
00:06:51,00:06:58,"thinks. So if you say to someone give me a good idea for a party they might say Pirates, Vodka,"
00:06:58,00:07:04,let's go to the top of the Eiffel Tower but the computer thinks you mean invite people you know.
00:07:04,00:07:08,I was quite grateful for that. In fact it showed me where I've been going wrong a few years in a
00:07:08,00:07:14,row now with my parties. Pirates and Vodka when is your daughter's first birthday party again?
00:07:14,00:07:21,Ah there's one great thing about chat GPD which is it has um it warns you it may occasionally
00:07:21,00:07:25,produce harmful instructions or biased content so it no and it's because it's broad it literally
00:07:25,00:07:29,has hoovered up trillions of words from all over the internet. That's quite good isn't it because
00:07:29,00:07:33,I know a lot of humans who don't realize that they're doing that. Exactly so it's aware of itself
00:07:33,00:07:38,and also the other great thing about it is it has limited knowledge of world and events after 2021
00:07:38,00:07:42,and I did try it I asked it who is Liz Truss and it says she's the Secretary of State for
00:07:42,00:07:49,International Trade. Oh it's just a simpler time. How many of you guys have a um a smart speaker?
00:07:50,00:07:53,Yeah like an Alexa thing. You've got one. Yeah yeah and I think you've got you've got a Google
00:07:53,00:08:00,thing yeah yeah so I don't know I bet you don't. I am a smart speaker Andy. Brilliant. But no I don't
00:08:00,00:08:07,have one. Okay okay that's roughly where I thought the three of you would be. Yeah yeah um do you
00:08:07,00:08:13,how do you address them do you say please? No you say hey fucker. Yeah point. Play me some music
00:08:13,00:08:20,now. It better be something I like. Okay. And come the revolution James. Goodbye.
00:08:20,00:08:27,Okay well that again is broadly in line with what you'd expect because men are much less
00:08:27,00:08:34,polite to their smart speakers than women. Okay. Men say please 45 percent of the time still feels
00:08:34,00:08:39,quite high and women 62 percent. Yeah I don't say please I'm sorry to say. I've never said please.
00:08:39,00:08:42,Well there's a school of thought which says you shouldn't say please and in fact you shouldn't
00:08:42,00:08:45,teach your children to say please because you're teaching them to respect the machines and
00:08:45,00:08:49,okay and there's another school of thought which says maybe we should teach them to respect the
00:08:49,00:08:54,machines and Google recently it added a function called pretty please right which I find a bit
00:08:54,00:09:00,sinister where if a user says please or thank you they will get a delightful response from the speaker
00:09:00,00:09:04,which starts with it'll say back to you something like thanks for asking so nicely and then it'll
00:09:04,00:09:10,say your answer. Oh yeah yeah but um I think you're very lonely aren't you if you need that from your
00:09:10,00:09:15,Alexa. I yeah well also you don't I don't say please or thank you in the hope that someone
00:09:15,00:09:18,will say thanks for asking so nicely. I think that should be a slightly nicer tone of voice
00:09:18,00:09:22,it uses for you and you should get a slightly ruder tone of voice back if you don't say please
00:09:22,00:09:26,or thank you I think that'll be a good way of doing it. Yeah or maybe it does things slightly worse.
00:09:26,00:09:32,Exactly. The less you say please or thank you the more you ask for it to play Bell and Sebastian
00:09:32,00:09:36,and it plays slipknot. Yeah it plays Bell and Sebastian but it also just spits in the middle
00:09:36,00:09:43,of the song just at the good bit and it puts you off. Is this what your one person parties
00:09:43,00:09:50,are like Andy? It's me and a load of speakers. They're all talking to each other. It's a social
00:09:50,00:09:55,nightmare. They're all playing each other Bell and Sebastian. I'm just wandering around the room
00:09:55,00:10:00,with my drink looking for someone to talk to. Bastard! Play Bastard! Come on somebody play Bastard!
00:10:02,00:10:08,Do you know there's a big split in the AI world at the moment between the I guess the deep machine
00:10:08,00:10:13,learning proponents which is most of what we usually talk about now so obviously you just
00:10:13,00:10:19,feed it shed loads of data and it figures stuff out and then the other group call themselves
00:10:19,00:10:26,GOFI which I just like and the GOFI is that stands for good old-fashioned AI. Oh okay.
00:10:26,00:10:32,What's that? So they're the ones who think that there needs to be more of an element of programming
00:10:32,00:10:38,and structure and human input and their argument is that you can only get so far with the machine
00:10:38,00:10:43,learning because what AI tends to be quite bad at if you do it that way is kind of categories
00:10:43,00:10:47,and hierarchies so it can get incredibly good at knowing what a cat is if you show a billion
00:10:47,00:10:51,pictures of cats. You can spot a cat just by a little hair on its tail but it's not very good
00:10:51,00:10:57,at knowing okay a cat's an animal and a dog's an animal so it'll see a dog and be like that's the
00:10:57,00:11:00,same as a cat or an elephant and be like that's similar to a cat in the sense that it's an animal.
00:11:00,00:11:06,Whereas it'd be more likely to see something which is not like a cat but has pointy ears
00:11:06,00:11:10,and think well that's the same as a cat because it looks like it. Exactly yeah it's kind of like
00:11:10,00:11:13,the difference between going to a foreign country and living there to learn a language
00:11:13,00:11:19,and kind of being taught the grammar I suppose. I actually do think that things like babble are
00:11:19,00:11:25,quite good programs for learning. You're off the clock now. No I think they're amazing.
00:11:27,00:11:33,Does it feel? Elon Musk says we've got to be careful AI is going to take over. Is it dangerous?
00:11:33,00:11:41,A. And what's I? That'll be like proclamation number one for the robots wasn't it? It's not AB
00:11:41,00:11:50,"anymore it goes A, I, BC. I've forgotten my follow-up question now. Is it is AI dangerous?"
00:11:50,00:11:56,Is it is AI dangerous? Yeah and will it make us forget things? Google what was I trying to say
00:11:56,00:12:01,please? What was my second question? Actually there's obviously a lot of debate as to whether
00:12:01,00:12:08,Elon Musk's AI is dangerous and kind of specifically in driverless cars and I read this amazing thing
00:12:08,00:12:12,from a few weeks ago which I hadn't really seen covered since I went to research this but there
00:12:12,00:12:17,was a famous demo video of a driverless car in 2016 which I think I remember is the one I'm
00:12:17,00:12:23,"thinking of and it was really well publicized, launched loads and loads of funding for driverless"
00:12:23,00:12:28,cars and lots of like excitement like here's what they can do and it's basically a video of a car
00:12:28,00:12:34,driving driverlessly on its own autonomously and navigating traffic lights and stuff but
00:12:34,00:12:38,there's a person sitting in the driver's seat and I remember we talked about this at the time I think
00:12:38,00:12:43,and it says under the video the person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons
00:12:43,00:12:48,he is not doing anything the car is driving itself. I remember that. Yeah engineer at Tesla's just
00:12:48,00:12:56,come out and said he was driving the car. Oh wow. That's weird. Isn't that mad? Because I thought
00:12:56,00:13:00,that in 2016 Tesla's did drive themselves for a shot you could go on to water. They could but it
00:13:00,00:13:05,was doing stuff that they couldn't do at that time so for instance it was stopping at a red light.
00:13:05,00:13:12,It was an AI that was programmed to play a video game a survival video game and they just wanted
00:13:12,00:13:17,to see what would happen and it got the highest score that anyone had ever got but it got that by
00:13:17,00:13:24,having lots of children and then eating them all. Okay oh my god. It's just a classic way of the AI
00:13:24,00:13:28,just finds a way out that no human would ever think of doing that right. Was that a thing you
00:13:28,00:13:33,could do in the game? Well they worked it out that it was a thing you could do you had to eat
00:13:33,00:13:39,right and you had a way of making children and every time you ate something you got more points
00:13:39,00:13:43,and so it's like well let's just keep making children. I got a fact about it seems like it's
00:13:43,00:13:49,about AI but it's actually about cows. You still spoiled the ending there wasn't it? There's an AI
00:13:49,00:13:56,that can eat grass and make milk. It's brilliant. So there are these smart dairy farms now right
00:13:56,00:14:01,and what they the point of them is that you can assess the health of your cows the whole time
00:14:01,00:14:06,by filming them right and that's it's actually more useful than having a person there watching them
00:14:06,00:14:11,even if you could have a person there working you know all the time and it's because you're scanning
00:14:11,00:14:17,them as they walk and you can see if they've got a bit lame right. Now the amazing fact is from
00:14:17,00:14:21,the person who designed the system or co-designed it is called Melvin Smith who says that cows hide
00:14:21,00:14:26,their limping when they think they're being watched because they're prey animals and if they've got
00:14:26,00:14:32,a bad foot they think oh I better conceal this and they walk no I'm fine I'm fine I'm just walking.
00:14:32,00:14:36,That's really interesting you know some humans like there are some humans that if you twist your ankle
00:14:36,00:14:40,you'll just kind of carry on walking and you don't want anyone to know and there's some humans who
00:14:40,00:14:47,make a right song and dance about it. Those ones who make a song and dance about it are the predators
00:14:47,00:14:53,and the ones who hide it are the prey. I didn't think I was a predator before but I make such a
00:14:53,00:14:59,fast whenever I've slightly turned an ankle or something. Shows how powerful you are. This is
00:14:59,00:15:05,actually a power move and I like some peas now. That's really interesting I was chatting to someone
00:15:05,00:15:12,on email for something else about an AI which has learned how to tell whether sheep are sad
00:15:12,00:15:19,or sick or something like that and because if you look at a sheep and you look at another sheep
00:15:19,00:15:23,it's really hard to tell anything about them because they just look like sheep right but there
00:15:23,00:15:30,are very very sort of micro expressions that they have when they have saw rudders or they have you
00:15:30,00:15:35,know saw feet or whatever but the AI can scan them and can tell with 80% accuracy which ones are
00:15:35,00:15:38,sick and which ones aren't sick. It's like a gambling thing isn't it like if you're playing
00:15:38,00:15:43,poker against a sheep you could use that. Yeah it's like a gambler's tell but I presume you could
00:15:43,00:15:47,use that in poker. I presume that if you had that kind of technology you programmed it for people
00:15:47,00:15:51,you could easily tell who had what in the hand of poker. I suppose it's possible that humans have
00:15:51,00:16:05,micro expressions. Certainly poker players think that there are certain tells that people have
00:16:05,00:16:10,like maybe your your pupils slightly dilate if you've got good cards or bad cards or stuff.
00:16:10,00:16:14,I don't know how to treat that. No I think most people are good at poker basically hide any
00:16:14,00:16:18,semblance of that and I don't think I think AI is better you're better off making an AI that has
00:16:18,00:16:23,X-ray vision to see through the cards. With the farm stuff though there's with pigs um if you
00:16:23,00:16:27,get sent a photo as a farmer of your pig if it's feeling unhappy it'll be like pig number eight is
00:16:27,00:16:34,feeling down just by the machines. Yeah by looking yeah it's incredible. Do you think the machines
00:16:34,00:16:40,are trying to get the animals on their side before they're apocalypse? Oh McDonald's had a farm AI AI.
00:16:46,00:16:53,Okay it is time for fact number two and that is Anna. My fact this week is that snails use trails
00:16:53,00:17:02,like we use roads. Do they get their mucus from a shell station by any chance? Wow see it's because
00:17:02,00:17:10,we haven't in real life where we get petrol from it's called shell as well. You are doing so well with that AI AI AI AI AI.
00:17:10,00:17:16,Look anyway snails leave this slime trail which obviously we've all seen and know about
00:17:16,00:17:22,and if another snail gets into that first snail slime trail and follows it it takes way way less
00:17:22,00:17:27,energy for it to move and when snails are moving a huge amount of the energy that they're using goes
00:17:27,00:17:32,into making this slime on which they kind of move so I think the mucus production the slime
00:17:32,00:17:39,production cost of moving outweighs the metabolic cost by 35 times. Right. What does that mean?
00:17:39,00:17:44,That means like you know if you're aspiring and trying to move the way we move that's the metabolic
00:17:44,00:17:50,cost but then on top of that they're using 35 times more energy on just making slime to move.
00:17:50,00:17:54,Basically this is why snails have never made anything of themselves it's quite tragic really.
00:17:54,00:17:59,Some snails I read they spend 60 percent of their energy making mucus right and it's just
00:17:59,00:18:03,there's no time. You spend so much of your life making podcasts and I don't think snails think
00:18:03,00:18:09,much of that. That's why I've never made anything of myself. Well that's what they do they're snails
00:18:09,00:18:13,they make mucus. Yeah I know but if they didn't have to make all these mucus I just wonder what
00:18:13,00:18:18,kind of stuff they'd have going on. But they can as a result of the mucus yes it's a terrible amount
00:18:18,00:18:22,of wasted energy when they're just trying to walk on say a flat surface but they can climb
00:18:22,00:18:27,walls they can go upside down that's the purpose of it they're spider-man we're just podcasters.
00:18:27,00:18:33,They're also making roads for other snails so they're you know utilitarianistically it's actually
00:18:33,00:18:37,quite a good thing for them to make. Yeah you're right. Yeah but I bet there are some snails who
00:18:37,00:18:41,just get dumped with all the mucus making and there are some real coasters aren't there. It's
00:18:41,00:18:46,just like fucking Barry again in my mucus trail and he's literally never seen him make his own
00:18:46,00:18:52,mucus. But he is you know he's doing very well for himself and the podcast is going brilliantly.
00:18:52,00:19:02,You rarely see a sort of you know gridlock of snails sort of traveling I always see snails
00:19:02,00:19:06,sort of quite isolated and alone. I think they've got very long stopping distances on the roads
00:19:06,00:19:12,much longer than us. Yeah you're right. I know I do agree with that because like if you see trails
00:19:12,00:19:17,in your garden or whatever it's not like you see a trail and then you see another snail following it
00:19:17,00:19:21,you don't tend to very much. True and I don't know why because the obviously they're more effective
00:19:21,00:19:27,at reducing the amount of energy it takes to move on them the newer they are so if you're on a
00:19:27,00:19:31,newly laid trail you know your heart you're reducing your energy levels cost by about 50
00:19:31,00:19:36,percent. Yeah and that's within a day you've got to get on that trail. Right wow. If we humans had
00:19:36,00:19:42,this ability you could effectively lay a trail so I could if I had my family to go out on a walk
00:19:42,00:19:48,I could go like I'll go out an hour early let me just walk ahead and then they all get on.
00:19:48,00:19:54,Let's go on a nice walk. Well I'll go at different times but they could catch up with me because
00:19:54,00:19:57,it'd be like walking on a travel later. They'll get back to the house just as you finish your
00:19:57,00:20:04,three hour walk. Lovely. Oh thanks darling that was really great. Great work. How are the kids?
00:20:04,00:20:10,Where are the kids? I really like the fact that snails leave dotted trails this is cool sometimes
00:20:10,00:20:15,they do and basically there are lots of different theories I've read about why. One is that there's
00:20:15,00:20:19,there's a kind of snail called the rosy wolf snail which is a predator snail
00:20:19,00:20:25,and it hunts other snails by their trails. Oh obviously if you get on the trail it just you
00:20:25,00:20:30,just follow it and then you you know you eat the snail then um so that might be the reason
00:20:30,00:20:33,or there's another guest that they're going over very rough terrain and it would actually
00:20:33,00:20:37,require so much slime to properly slime all the ground under them that they make a little economy
00:20:37,00:20:42,there and they just proceed without making slime for every bit of the ground. I like the idea that
00:20:42,00:20:46,they're leaving gaps so that people can't follow them. That's a cool idea isn't it? That's a nice
00:20:46,00:20:51,idea because there was a thing wasn't there last year in the news where they found some someone
00:20:51,00:20:56,was smuggling snails in an airport or something and they found one snail and then they just followed
00:20:56,00:21:01,his snail trail back and they found like a hundred more or something like that. That's exactly what
00:21:01,00:21:07,there's giant African land snails they're absolutely mega and people import them to eat them.
00:21:07,00:21:11,They're really vilified the African land snails and in fact they have a close relationship with
00:21:11,00:21:17,the rosy wolf snails who I think are the most vicious snails on the planet. They're so they're
00:21:17,00:21:23,known as cannibal snails and honestly look up a video of them eating other snails it's so frightful.
00:21:23,00:21:29,Time lapse it must be. Yeah yeah I'll put it on at least two times speed so they'll catch up with
00:21:29,00:21:33,the snail by following in its trail the rosy wolf snail. They'll sort of climb over its shell and then
00:21:33,00:21:38,the snail obviously retreats back into its shell trying to get away and the rosy wolf just sticks
00:21:38,00:21:43,its head. Imagine how frightening that is this huge head coming into your shell and sucks it all
00:21:43,00:21:48,out. It's grotesque. This is actually a question that's been I saw it online there's a meme question
00:21:48,00:21:52,the other day so the question is you can have 10 million dollars yeah 10 million quid. Oh I don't
00:21:52,00:21:58,want this bloody Malcolm Gladwell question again. You can have 10 million quid but if you accept it
00:21:58,00:22:04,there is a snail always chasing you somewhere around the world it doesn't ever stop moving
00:22:04,00:22:08,it always knows where you are and it doesn't ever die. But what do you accept the money. But what
00:22:08,00:22:17,it's a killer snail. Oh sorry I missed out the only important bit of information. And crunch
00:22:17,00:22:25,proper. It follows the movie isn't it basically. It follows but with the snail yeah. I don't think
00:22:25,00:22:33,I take the money. Right. No because I like peace of mind. Yeah. Couldn't you just live half the year
00:22:33,00:22:38,in Australia and the other half the year in the UK. So just as he's kind of getting over the
00:22:38,00:22:44,Tasman Sea you get on a plane. Is he or she a clever snail in that respect. If I boarded a flight
00:22:44,00:22:49,to Australia. Oh could it board the next one. Could it board the next one. Was that what these
00:22:49,00:22:56,guys were doing in the airport. Yeah it could yeah yeah it's a clever snail. Oh okay well that's
00:22:56,00:23:00,a bit different because I think the whole point of it being a snail is it's going to take forever
00:23:00,00:23:07,to get to you. Oh sorry and it's got legs in it rubs. And a knife. And a six foot. So yeah snails
00:23:07,00:23:12,are frightening I think is what we've learned here. But actually sorry I did mention a connection
00:23:12,00:23:15,between the African land snail which is a big bad guy because it's this big snail and it destroys
00:23:15,00:23:21,invasive species and the rosy wool snail and that's because so in Hawaii there's loads of
00:23:21,00:23:26,kind of endangered species of snail. Lots of types of tree snail and the African land snail
00:23:26,00:23:32,rocked up and started threatening them. And so in 1955 we did the classic and we thought what we'll
00:23:32,00:23:37,do is we'll introduce a bigger snail to eat the African land snail. And now I went to Hawaii a
00:23:37,00:23:42,few years ago if you go there's just one massive snail. That's the island isn't it. So they introduced
00:23:42,00:23:47,another bigger snail. Yeah and the it decided the rosy wool snail decided it preferred the taste
00:23:47,00:23:50,of all the delicious tree snails that were really endangered to the African land snail and it's now
00:23:50,00:23:56,responsible for the extinction of at least eight native species. Oh man. We've got to stop doing
00:23:56,00:24:02,that. We've got to stop it. So some um winkles kind of snail um that you can read the slime trails of
00:24:02,00:24:08,other snails and then get all sorts of data from the slime the sex the species the direction it was
00:24:08,00:24:14,going and how attractive it is as a mate. From its slime. Yeah and if you're a lady snail and you're
00:24:14,00:24:22,free of parasites which is to a male there's a base basically the Benny Hill show happens where
00:24:22,00:24:26,you've got a load of male snails chasing you and this happens so much that there are some they're
00:24:26,00:24:31,called rough periwinkles. The females they can change the composition of their slime and basically
00:24:31,00:24:37,turn on a cloaking mode where to hide their parasites they would hide the sex oh they leave
00:24:37,00:24:43,a sex neutral trail because they've got so many bloody male rough periwinkles chasing after them.
00:24:43,00:24:48,Oh really? I'm not interested and so they change the slime. How cool is that? That's clever. Yeah
00:24:48,00:24:54,that's amazing. Yeah like a phone box like a sticker in a phone box your snail is a snail trail.
00:24:54,00:24:58,I didn't know I was just trying to think what the human equivalent is of leaving a trail behind you
00:24:58,00:25:04,advertising how sexy you are. Oh those things in the phone boxes. Yeah it's a dated reference. I
00:25:04,00:25:09,don't think the way they work is you go to one phone box and they say right now to the next phone
00:25:09,00:25:13,box and you keep going down the phone boxes until you eventually reach the prostitute. I think that's
00:25:13,00:25:20,how it works isn't it? More and more clues every time one more number added to the phone number.
00:25:20,00:25:25,She's been here. She doesn't then conceal her trail by leaving a gender neutral card in a phone
00:25:25,00:25:32,box. No no she doesn't not that kind of. What an average time. We should move on in a sec.
00:25:32,00:25:39,I just have some things on slime that I quite like. Do you know that to most of the inhabitants
00:25:39,00:25:46,"of the ocean? The ocean is slime. It's thick and viscous. Slimy, viscous. Slimy. What's official"
00:25:46,00:25:51,things? This to think smaller than fish so I think to like plankton and microbes and I don't think we
00:25:51,00:25:56,know how it actually feels to them but basically this was an article there's a new scientist in
00:25:56,00:26:03,the year 2000 so maybe it's been completely disproven but basically they found out that
00:26:03,00:26:07,there are way more sugar molecules in the seawater than we thought there were. It's like this whole
00:26:07,00:26:13,mesh of sort of saccharide molecules and they trap water in their mesh and that creates this kind
00:26:13,00:26:19,of gel and it's cobwebby it described it as and so if you're a small animal going through that
00:26:19,00:26:24,because you're so tiny that feels like really thick and viscous and we think it must feel
00:26:24,00:26:28,like that to them because if you look at how microorganisms are distributed in the sea or
00:26:28,00:26:33,like plankton or tiny things they're not evenly distributed or randomly distributed they're sort
00:26:33,00:26:38,of in clusters because I guess some bits are thicker than others in this weird cobweb and so
00:26:38,00:26:44,they can't plow through them. So you're just a little kind of bit of plankton going down the sea
00:26:44,00:26:47,you can't really swim because you're plankton that's the whole point of plankton but then
00:26:47,00:26:52,occasionally you just get to a bit and you're like 'oh great this is all slimy now' yeah do you mean
00:26:52,00:26:58,great sarcastically yeah yeah yeah but can you climb through the water if you're plankton you can't
00:26:58,00:27:03,do anything you're just whatever the current happens yeah whatever happens happens no wonder
00:27:03,00:27:19,they've evolved sarcasm is the most powerful weapon okay it is time for fact number three
00:27:19,00:27:26,and that is James okay my fact this week is that italy's defense minister was once hospitalised
00:27:26,00:27:33,for smoking 150 cigarettes in a day. Was it a challenge? What was it? Was it a competition?
00:27:33,00:27:40,I think he was very stressed it was during an election in 2013 this is a guy called Guido Cressetto
00:27:40,00:27:46,and anyone who follows Italian politics will know that quite recently the brothers of Italy have
00:27:46,00:27:53,have won an election or become the biggest party and they formed a government and they're kind of
00:27:53,00:28:01,like the eukipi nationalist party of Italy and Guido who I think was the leader of brothers of
00:28:01,00:28:09,Italy at the time in 2013 he was electioneering and apparently had one cigarette every six minutes
00:28:09,00:28:16,from 8 a.m to 11 p.m and started feeling not very well and had to go to hospital wow but then
00:28:16,00:28:21,after a few days he was fine okay what does that do to you that level of intensity what did they
00:28:21,00:28:25,diagnose him with well he felt that it was stress related as well I think that oh yeah
00:28:25,00:28:34,so do you um do you drink oh I just have a sherry at Christmas do you smoke well you know just
00:28:34,00:28:40,just 150 a day just every six minutes yeah I think definitely the stress thing though and I live
00:28:40,00:28:46,quite near a main road so can I unpack the six minute thing though because is that including
00:28:46,00:28:52,is that post finishing a cigarette with a six minute break no so every six minutes he would
00:28:52,00:28:57,have had to have started and ended for the mouth to work how was it just my cigarette a few minutes
00:28:57,00:29:01,you have to go quite quite quickly to get through one in three or four minutes he might not have got
00:29:01,00:29:05,to the to the filter in all of them right right yeah because you're busy it's stressful you're
00:29:05,00:29:10,campaigning here I tried to find any evidence anyone had ever smoked more than this in a day
00:29:10,00:29:16,and I don't know if you guys found Stefan Sigmund oh yeah right but he's called Sigmund oh yeah
00:29:16,00:29:22,cool yeah wow Stefan Sigmund Sigmund Sigmund yeah yeah yeah it's close enough anyway in 1996 what he
00:29:22,00:29:27,did he um he was trying to get a Guinness World Record apparently and it's there are some people
00:29:27,00:29:32,who say it didn't happen but there is a photo of him doing it okay he jammed 800 cigarettes into a
00:29:32,00:29:39,wheel rigged them all up to a pipe yeah and smoked 800 cigarettes in six minutes yeah and it was a
00:29:39,00:29:45,rotating wheel and the idea was that he'd be able to get a little bit of all the cigarettes the people
00:29:45,00:29:49,who said I think it definitely happened that I think most people who say that it didn't happen
00:29:49,00:29:53,were are more saying that he couldn't have got much from the ones on the outside of the wheel
00:29:53,00:29:58,oh yeah yeah that surely wasn't accepted as well Guinness said it was not environmentally friendly
00:29:58,00:30:03,yeah well one good reason why it's not but no it's yeah I read a newspaper article about him
00:30:03,00:30:10,because at the same time as doing this he also ate 29 hard boiled eggs in four minutes
00:30:10,00:30:17,and he leaped into a lake from 135 foot cliff all in order to get into the Guinness Book of Records
00:30:17,00:30:22,but Carol Jones a Guinness spokesperson said we do discourage this sort of thing
00:30:22,00:30:27,and suggested that he tried the record for collecting cigarettes instead of smoking them
00:30:27,00:30:33,okay so yeah I wonder if he got any I wonder if he holds any for any of those events because it sounds
00:30:33,00:30:37,these ones that he did it was almost like an advert because it was in quite a lot of newspapers
00:30:37,00:30:42,during the day and it was almost like it was an advert for Guinness saying don't do these stupid
00:30:42,00:30:46,things because you won't get in the Guinness Book of Records because it like listed a few
00:30:46,00:30:51,things you couldn't get records for that's mad I was just looking at tips for quitting if you're
00:30:51,00:30:56,the 150 a day kind of person and I just came across an article that I really enjoyed in the
00:30:56,00:31:01,Guardian because it asked for other people's ways that they'd found quit smoking when the
00:31:01,00:31:06,normal stuff didn't work and so if the patches and the gum haven't worked for you here's what some
00:31:06,00:31:11,people recommend there was Pete who got all I thought you were going to say you smoked peter
00:31:11,00:31:18,instead but bury yourself in it yeah yeah and on top of that you won't be drafted into the war
00:31:18,00:31:25,it's a win-win situation sorry Anna peter peter peter yes he had all of his teeth removed
00:31:25,00:31:29,he smoked for about 40 years and he went to the dentist and said stop you from being able to
00:31:29,00:31:34,smoke because I did that not that on its own but he had them take out all of his smoking yellow
00:31:34,00:31:39,teeth and then he had them all replaced with fake teeth which look really good and then he was like
00:31:39,00:31:44,well I don't do anything to damage these fake teeth that's a good idea yeah incentivizing like a great
00:31:44,00:31:51,way to quit um pull out all your teeth well there's okay here's a different method then
00:31:51,00:31:55,because they do a lot obviously the warnings on the packet and then I think some countries have
00:31:55,00:31:59,considered warnings on each individual cigarette in case you haven't got the message from the
00:31:59,00:32:04,pictures on the packet which you've seen your mouth you can't read it unless you could create
00:32:04,00:32:13,a cigarette that gives smoke signals but say stop smoking that's good like Gandalf kind of breathing
00:32:13,00:32:21,out that shit but he'd breathe out a picture of a diseased lung the director's cut yeah yeah yeah
00:32:21,00:32:27,um well they kind of so in 2013 there were some researchers at sterling who kind of did this
00:32:27,00:32:33,they made a packet of cigarettes which shouted at you when you opened the packet it played an
00:32:33,00:32:39,audio clip warning about the dangers of smoking I think that's quite good yeah I have a um I've got
00:32:39,00:32:46,a musical biscuit tin do you yeah yeah and does it say stop eating biscuits fat so it was it was
00:32:46,00:32:49,a Christmas present and I'm still still working my way through it because it's loads of biscuits in it
00:32:49,00:32:54,but every time you open it it's very hard not to play a bit of the tune because you move it just
00:32:54,00:32:58,you know you move it and it's quite delicate and so and it does it's more made me stealthy about
00:32:58,00:33:03,opening the tin because I don't want I don't want to give away the fact that I'm um yeah yeah eating
00:33:03,00:33:08,biscuits that's kind of clever I don't want my neighbors to hear and come over and say hey can I
00:33:08,00:33:12,have a biscuit you know well so you think you're going to be like an ice cream man your neighbors are
00:33:12,00:33:18,going to hear a song of biscuits very close to my neighbors with great friends but you know you've
00:33:18,00:33:22,got to keep keep some things private you've got to have some boundaries yeah I think that's one of
00:33:22,00:33:28,them um I've just one guessing game for just one other way to quit smoking yeah one woman said
00:33:28,00:33:34,convert from when you're drinking tea convert from mugs to a cup and saucer she said this is what
00:33:34,00:33:38,made her quit so she would have had a ciggy with a mug of tea very good yeah but it's good to put
00:33:38,00:33:41,your cigarette in the saucer because you've got something to rest on it's like a mini ashtray
00:33:41,00:33:48,yep um a mug a mug what's the difference does the mug have like because they can have writing
00:33:48,00:33:57,on them does it say mmm a lovely fag she only had pro smoking mugs yeah they used to do big
00:33:57,00:34:01,business in them I actually think she might be using a cup and saucer differently to how we
00:34:01,00:34:05,might use one for this to work oh she holds them in both hands and you got this third hand free
00:34:05,00:34:11,beauty that's clever that's the object of a cup and saucer she got rid of all the tables in her house
00:34:11,00:34:19,so she had to hold them she moved to a mountainous region with no flat surfaces at all just one
00:34:19,00:34:26,cup one saucer it was a huge sacrifice actually she only spoke one a week right that's amazing so
00:34:26,00:34:30,there's a big movement these days obviously for trying to stop people from smoking almost all
00:34:30,00:34:36,together so a lot of people on top of that are trying to erase their relationship with cigarettes
00:34:36,00:34:42,particularly for big companies um so the example I have Walt Disney Walt Disney supposedly used to
00:34:42,00:34:47,smoke about three packs of ciggies a day and if you used to go around Walt Disney World uh Disney
00:34:47,00:34:52,World you would see pictures of him holding cigarettes and so many shots it's just he's
00:34:52,00:34:57,got a ciggy in his hand and what they've done is they've photoshopped out every single cigarette
00:34:57,00:35:01,that's ever found in a photo of Walt Disney at Disneyland so wherever you go the photo is
00:35:01,00:35:05,still the same photo but the cigarette is now missing do they put something else in his hand
00:35:05,00:35:09,no they don't so that's the thing you've got this weird little point thing make it a pencil
00:35:09,00:35:15,yeah so easy what they've done instead is every member of staff is trained to do the Walt Disney
00:35:15,00:35:20,point with their two fingers so that normalizes it yeah and this is even used in the movie where
00:35:20,00:35:26,Tom Hanks plays Walt Disney with the the Mary Poppins movie that was done yeah it looks a bit
00:35:26,00:35:29,like he's doing gun fingers it does gun fingers doesn't it all like you're swearing at someone if
00:35:29,00:35:34,you leave a gap a cigarette exactly if you have a tiny gap but so members of staff are specifically
00:35:34,00:35:39,trained to do the Walt Disney point which he never did because he had a ciggy in it and when when do
00:35:39,00:35:42,you do it do they tell you when to do it or is it just every five minutes you have to do it three
00:35:42,00:35:46,times I think probably if you're pointing somewhere maybe it's just over there maybe um if you're a
00:35:46,00:35:54,bit stressed after sex yeah with a cup of tea um so cigarettes don't smell very nice to a lot of
00:35:54,00:35:58,people agreed yeah they smell pretty horrible to a lot of people agree to a lot I suppose it
00:35:58,00:36:04,depends if you're a smoker yeah yeah okay but have you heard of nice cigarettes these are these
00:36:04,00:36:10,were launched in 1989 um they were called the that wasn't the official brand name I can't remember
00:36:10,00:36:14,the official brand name but it was basically the first cigarette to smell good was the idea
00:36:14,00:36:18,and it was they burned with a vanilla smell and they were advertised under the slogan
00:36:18,00:36:24,you shouldn't have to leave the room you shouldn't have to apologize oh yeah well that's just gonna
00:36:24,00:36:29,smell like a vape which I must say I'm not a big fan of either well it's sold terribly and they like
00:36:29,00:36:33,there have been a few attempts but they were all the kind of proto vape things so premier smokeless
00:36:33,00:36:39,cigarettes was another kind they were tested in 1989 um and smokers didn't like them well customers
00:36:39,00:36:45,who tried it complained that it smelled bad lack flavor and it was too hot to touch and industry
00:36:45,00:36:52,experts noted that it could also be used to smoke crack so it didn't make it off the testing line
00:36:52,00:37:00,really right yeah but apart from that doesn't think smokers like the smell and taste of cigarettes
00:37:00,00:37:04,and have never liked stuff that doesn't really taste like it really except the occasional eccentric
00:37:04,00:37:11,smoker who used to smoke some menthol cigarettes um just lest we think that smoking is on its way
00:37:11,00:37:17,out asap it's going up worldwide in terms of number of smokers and that is related to the
00:37:17,00:37:24,population going out but still it's the biggest cause of preventable deaths in the world and by
00:37:24,00:37:28,quite a long way because I actually didn't look up the second biggest but I always sort of like
00:37:28,00:37:34,things like car crashes are really big and other things are around alcohol even like I wonder how
00:37:34,00:37:39,I wonder if they can measure alcohol yeah you can you've got nails that following you around for
00:37:39,00:37:46,your 10 million quid that's actually ironically hot on the heels of smoking the whole point of
00:37:46,00:37:51,that is it's not preventable that's like literally you just can't stop leading inevitable cause of
00:37:51,00:38:00,death obviously smoking has been banned in various places over the years and in new york it was banned
00:38:00,00:38:11,in 1908 smoking but only for women really yeah um on ladylike pretty much yeah pretty much that
00:38:11,00:38:16,they hadn't invented that Audrey Hepburn long cigarette absolutely that came down later yeah
00:38:16,00:38:23,it was a very short-lived ban basically in 1907 there was a cafe a very trendy cafe in new york
00:38:23,00:38:28,that allowed women to smoke because usually people women didn't really smoke in in public very much
00:38:28,00:38:33,because it was seen as un-ladylike but this bar decided actually we don't care about that anyone
00:38:33,00:38:38,could smoke if they want and then it was really really popular and so a load of other bars started
00:38:38,00:38:44,to let women smoke in there and the politicians didn't like it there was a um politician called
00:38:44,00:38:51,timothy little tim sullivan and he decided that he was going to ban smoking even though he had
00:38:51,00:38:58,personally never seen a woman smoke right he still decided he was going to ban it and they did ban it
00:38:58,00:39:04,and there was only one woman katie mulcahi uh who was the only person who was cited for violating
00:39:04,00:39:10,the crime uh because a few weeks later the mayor of new york fee told it said actually this is
00:39:10,00:39:16,ridiculous we're going to stop this really for two weeks and for one woman in new york it was
00:39:16,00:39:21,illegal that's cool for katie i bet that i got her a good reputation i reckon did you guys see
00:39:21,00:39:25,we were just mentioning Audrey Hepburn had you know those those beautiful what would they call
00:39:25,00:39:30,it holders the cigarette holders yeah did you see the inventions of robert stone who this is in
00:39:30,00:39:36,the 1950s he just tried to come up with new and innovative ways to make smoking a more pleasurable
00:39:36,00:39:41,experience um so he invented these holders there was one brilliant one where it was for if it was
00:39:41,00:39:46,raining and you wanted to have a ciggy um it had just a little umbrella that hangs over the cigarette
00:39:46,00:39:51,itself off the back of its holder yeah it looked really really clever there was the periscope
00:39:51,00:39:57,ciggy which would go upwards um no no specific purpose as far as i can see uh for the periscope
00:39:57,00:40:01,ciggy if you're in a submarine and you want a fag what do you do because you can't go outside
00:40:01,00:40:10,yes but you had a massive pipe going up there well we didn't see the approaching warship um
00:40:10,00:40:16,because perkins was using the periscope have a quick gasper ironically they found us through
00:40:16,00:40:25,the lit tip of the cigarette um actually weirdly until 2010 you could smoke in a submarine as well
00:40:25,00:40:29,oh yeah yeah it was yeah there was there was a room there was a smokers room in submarines and
00:40:29,00:40:34,you could smoke down there spaces at a premium on submarines yes yeah it's amazing how geared
00:40:34,00:40:37,everything was towards smokers needed spaces interesting so many people smoke yeah interesting
00:40:37,00:40:41,thing is the beetles had a white submarine but it just got stained by all the nicotine
00:40:41,00:40:53,okay it's time for our final fact of the show and that's my fact my fact this week is that actually
00:40:53,00:40:59,we've all been pronouncing covrant garden wrong okay come on dan all right what are you on about
00:40:59,00:41:04,everyone or have you been doing it right all along i've been doing it wrong as well a different
00:41:04,00:41:10,kind of wrong different kind of wrong still wrong so i was looking into covrant garden i love where
00:41:10,00:41:16,we work i love this area it's it's full of incredible historical significance and while
00:41:16,00:41:21,looking into it i discovered that the word is actually a bastardization of the word convent
00:41:21,00:41:26,it should be convent garden that's how this started the very first mention that was ever made of
00:41:26,00:41:33,convent garden was in the 1200s and um it was uh in reference to the fact that this area was a lot
00:41:33,00:41:37,of it was garden and for westminster abbey they had lots of vegetables and so on here so this is
00:41:37,00:41:42,prior to the big market and the reason it became a market that's almost a but wait you've you've
00:41:42,00:41:47,explained why the garden bit's pronounced garden but um the convent bit is it the garden of a
00:41:47,00:41:51,convent right yeah it was garden of a convent there were lots of monks here and so on and they
00:41:51,00:41:55,were running it and so it was known as convent garden this was basically a big old monastery
00:41:55,00:42:01,around here that wasn't kind of attached to westminster abbey which is not that close to here
00:42:01,00:42:05,which makes you think wonder how that works but actually a load of monks lived here and it was
00:42:05,00:42:10,the dissolution of the monasteries famously under henry the eighth that sold it all off and then it
00:42:10,00:42:15,became what it is today yeah is it i think i read this too long ago to be absolutely sure of it now
00:42:15,00:42:20,but basically this was quite under under populated bit of london because there were two main bits
00:42:20,00:42:25,of london which were the westminster you know cedar power and that was the city yeah which is
00:42:25,00:42:30,over further east and actually the bit in between was not really populated at all not really it was
00:42:30,00:42:36,this sort of two bit system and yeah i think it definitely went down population wise like it was
00:42:36,00:42:41,a thing about the eighth ninth century then it went down and then it came up again but i think
00:42:41,00:42:45,technically dan you could argue you've been pronouncing it more right than us really well
00:42:45,00:42:52,you're pronouncing it with an extra r yeah and what is r except half of an n in covent garden
00:42:52,00:42:58,he puts the r towards the end of the word covent don't you yeah yeah is there any other covent
00:42:58,00:43:05,do you get covent anywhere else coventry yeah should that have been coventry oh my god yeah
00:43:05,00:43:11,or was it a place where witches lived mm-hmm coventry the coventry yeah and that's why
00:43:11,00:43:18,Hitler went for it yeah didn't like the witches yeah famously fair enough um not fair enough
00:43:18,00:43:24,my grandma lived in coventry we won't be tired in coventry anytime soon then
00:43:26,00:43:32,um yeah com god market was is the main thing that com god was famous for wasn't it yeah for
00:43:32,00:43:38,centuries and um oh man it was so interesting such a cool time what period are we talking
00:43:38,00:43:46,oh centuries which particular centuries i think it started being officially a market in 1670
00:43:46,00:43:50,didn't it but it had been used the market before that okay and in fact still is today if you if you
00:43:50,00:43:54,wander out into the market from the office you'll find it's not your big fruit and veg it's not the
00:43:54,00:43:57,biggest fruit and veg market in the country anymore like it was from whatever year around i
00:43:57,00:44:03,said it was um but they sell knock off football jerseys yeah that's true and those are sort of
00:44:03,00:44:08,the vegetables of today are they yeah um but the market porters were a huge thing and um
00:44:08,00:44:13,there's amazing footage as footage from the kind of 20s and 30s of them carrying stacks of the
00:44:13,00:44:16,baskets on their heads because that was how everything was transported in the market
00:44:16,00:44:20,and they were slightly domed in the base so they fit on your head very neatly and they
00:44:20,00:44:25,stacked really well and have you heard of basket jim basket jim he's had a person it's a person he
00:44:25,00:44:29,was called jim sainsbury i don't know if any relation but he worked at the common garden
00:44:29,00:44:36,market in the 1920s and 30s and there's footage of him doing 25 baskets in a stack on his head wow
00:44:36,00:44:40,that's like the stuff in the baskets yeah i don't know if they're full or not i think maybe for the
00:44:40,00:44:44,show for display purposes they might have been empty yeah yeah that's still a lot though isn't
00:44:44,00:44:48,it's the balance is the main thing yeah yeah it must be a different family otherwise surely sainsbury's
00:44:48,00:44:55,baskets would have that head shape if you walk around sainsbury's now i think you have to put it
00:44:55,00:45:01,on you do you know the first sainsbury's was in covent garden really interesting enough yeah it's
00:45:01,00:45:07,on the dreary lane just down the road from here uh and they sold like um what was it called railway
00:45:07,00:45:12,milk that was their big seller it wasn't disgusting you have to get up so early in the morning to see
00:45:12,00:45:18,the trains being milked but it's a beautiful site the idea was that it came from like devon and
00:45:18,00:45:24,cornwall but it came on the railway so it's still fresh okay right the square was built for the
00:45:24,00:45:31,fourth earl of bedford by inigo jones the famous architect for international listeners inigo jones
00:45:31,00:45:35,i always feel sorry for because he's gone down in history as not christopher wren essentially
00:45:35,00:45:39,in in england wouldn't you say he's basically the the other architect that's not christopher wren
00:45:39,00:45:45,yeah he was very famous architect yeah but he's just the second most famous architect sure he was
00:45:45,00:45:49,i'm sorry inigo i just wanted to say oh fair enough christopher wren who designed st paul's
00:45:49,00:45:52,cathedral we should also say for international listeners yes i don't think christopher wren is
00:45:52,00:45:57,that famous outside the uk either no or in the uk to be honest and inigo jones is less famous than
00:45:57,00:46:03,him but still very cool and has a cooler name as well yeah well he he actually has a less um
00:46:03,00:46:09,fun name than one of the people he worked with so he was um he worked under james first and
00:46:09,00:46:17,charles the first uh alongside the official royal stone master uh who was called nicholas stone
00:46:17,00:46:24,nice amazing really good stone master yeah the stone master what would the stone master do
00:46:24,00:46:28,well he would have worked with stone he would have worked with was he he was nicking stone he was a
00:46:28,00:46:36,sculptor for sure so nicking it isn't nicholas nicks stone very good yeah and inigo jones was
00:46:36,00:46:40,more famous no less famous but quite famous for being the first person to do a survey of stone
00:46:40,00:46:48,hench speaking of stone that's cool yeah but he did say that it was a roman temple which it wasn't
00:46:48,00:46:52,right and that's why he's only the second most famous because christopher wren would have got
00:46:52,00:46:56,that straight away he loved roman stuff um actually the sad thing another sad thing about
00:46:56,00:47:02,inigo jones is that um the main thing he had to do really in this square he was asked to build a
00:47:02,00:47:07,square fit for gentlemen with ability uh by the ear of bed for the ability of being able to carry
00:47:07,00:47:13,baskets on your head yeah just for the basket carriers yeah and the living statues no it's
00:47:13,00:47:18,basically for really posh rich people and so the only thing they wanted they wanted a completely
00:47:18,00:47:23,bare square so it was the first time london had had this a huge expanse with nothing in the middle
00:47:23,00:47:29,so you know you could prom not about it and then with a church in it and it was st paul's and the
00:47:29,00:47:35,church still is st paul's so christopher wren designed st paul's cathedral big f off uh beautiful
00:47:35,00:47:39,cathedral down the road and then he designed little st paul's church on covent garden that's
00:47:39,00:47:47,still there today but st paul's covent garden is better in some ways in some ways because it's uh
00:47:47,00:47:55,it's a reverse church it's a reverse it's where god comes to worship me yeah right yeah it's um
00:47:55,00:48:01,yeah the church authorities aren't very happy about it actually uh a bit sacrilegious but it's
00:48:01,00:48:04,no it's uh it's a wrong way church isn't it it's a wrong way around church because what do you mean
00:48:04,00:48:08,well basically churches have their doors at the west end and then the east end is the bit that
00:48:08,00:48:14,faces towards jerusalem that's how churches are laid out yeah right yeah okay yeah that's just
00:48:14,00:48:18,there's how churches are but he because he wanted the doors to open onto the piazzas was the first
00:48:18,00:48:22,ever piazza that we were going to have in the uk very exciting he wanted these huge great double
00:48:22,00:48:25,doors so he built them like that and then the church said absolutely not you're going to have
00:48:25,00:48:28,the altar at the east end and you're going to have the door at the west end like normal and so the
00:48:28,00:48:33,doors are kind of false doors but and then there's a real door yeah that makes so much sense because
00:48:33,00:48:38,the back looks so much like a front kind of thing with that church it's a bit confusing yeah it's a
00:48:38,00:48:43,reversive person church so do all churches face jerusalem not all of them but the idea is that they
00:48:43,00:48:47,face east because that's where you're looking and that's where you know when you're praying you're
00:48:47,00:48:51,you're sitting in church facing the front you're facing towards jerusalem if you're ever lost yeah
00:48:51,00:48:57,in a town go to the church whichever way it faces just walk in that direction if i'm on my way to
00:48:57,00:49:04,jerusalem you'll get to jerusalem yeah i'm the squeezy jiff lemon there we go to covent garden
00:49:04,00:49:08,squeezy jiff lemon sorry there's a lemon juice product called jiff and it comes in a bottle
00:49:08,00:49:14,that looks like a lemon it was invented by a man called edward hack in 1957 um not his not an
00:49:14,00:49:20,original idea but no no that was that's just a joke um supposedly he he looked at the whole every
00:49:20,00:49:25,lemon there was in harrods and sulfur it is of fortnum and masons and then he looked at 900
00:49:25,00:49:30,individual lemons at covent garden to find the perfect lemon to base his oh i see because it's
00:49:30,00:49:34,in the shape of a lemon it's in the shape of a lemon okay yeah i thought you're gonna say you
00:49:34,00:49:39,looked at them all and made an average of all of those shapes no i think you just found one
00:49:39,00:49:44,unbelievably nice lemon the flawless lemon i must admit i don't actually find any one lemon more
00:49:44,00:49:51,attractive than any other lemon but that's just me uh james you've got no heart yeah there was a
00:49:51,00:49:58,place called the rose tavern which i think was the best place to hang out in the 1700s and um it was
00:49:58,00:50:06,where criminals highwaymen prostitutes or but then actors poets artists samuel peep spent a lot of
00:50:06,00:50:13,time there he said he really liked the food are you going to the brothel against samuel no no no
00:50:13,00:50:19,i'm going for the sausage rolls fish and chips is honestly done i just like that simple pub grub
00:50:19,00:50:25,and the topless woman who serves it to me um there's rose street up there is it there
00:50:25,00:50:29,i think it might be because i think it is still there rose street and then just off of
00:50:29,00:50:34,there's some floral passage or something yeah yeah floral lane or something probably okay and
00:50:34,00:50:38,they handed the people who sort of performed there had amazing tricks so there were topless
00:50:38,00:50:44,women would wrestle there um there's a there's a thing and you could put bets on it it employed
00:50:44,00:50:50,lots of posture moles which i'd never heard of but posture moles i don't think you're gonna
00:50:50,00:50:55,guess what this is well it's obvious isn't it you dig down a hole into someone's garden
00:50:55,00:51:00,and then when you come out you sit straight oh it's like this um like the conductor ethyl
00:51:00,00:51:05,smith tying herself to a tree to improve posture okay i don't think it would have got as much
00:51:05,00:51:09,custom in the pub if it was your version but it would have been closer to mole is a is a is a
00:51:09,00:51:14,is a prostitute of some kind oh mole i see yeah oh because i heard that posture women was a nickname
00:51:14,00:51:18,for the uh the women playing the trade it probably is the same maybe it's posture moles posture women
00:51:18,00:51:23,but these people uh used to emphasize that they were not prostitutes but what they did was they
00:51:23,00:51:28,would be paid by the cleontel your samuel peeps is either to be flogged or to flog them
00:51:28,00:51:34,one of those in public in front of people in the pub in public yeah oh yeah i know sexy that is
00:51:34,00:51:40,saucy well i guess a strip club these days it's all in the open isn't it as well they don't have
00:51:40,00:51:48,a cast of nine tails don't always ask for the whipping it's been 300 years okay sorry um but
00:51:48,00:51:54,the way they advertise who they were to say you know i'll whip you if you want was they would lie
00:51:54,00:52:00,naked on a table and a waiter would bring a lit candle on a tray over to them and they would
00:52:00,00:52:05,simulate kind of having sex with it with the climax being that they would snuff the candle
00:52:05,00:52:10,out so wait a minute until that had happened you just think it's a normal naked woman lying on
00:52:10,00:52:14,your table and then as soon as she blows out the candle having pretended to have sex with it you're
00:52:14,00:52:21,like oh you're a prostitute exactly you're not you weren't just passing and felt like a lie down

00:52:55,00:53:00,obscene and hazardous manner to rows of approval from her audience because it's quite you know like
00:53:00,00:53:04,if you have a candle and you manage to put it out with your fingers because you lick your fingers

00:54:19,00:54:25,maiden lane and right at the bottom of maiden lane on one end opposite on the corner of bedford
00:54:25,00:54:28,street there is a building there and if you look up on the building you'll see a plaque and that
00:54:28,00:54:33,plaque reads that charles dickens used to live here in the workhouse when he was a young boy
00:54:33,00:54:40,and i was looking into it and that building was it was a sort of a working house and he used to
00:54:40,00:54:45,work downstairs putting black polish into tins and you know you would sell that and i'm pretty sure
00:54:45,00:54:49,it's where there used to be a tji fridays on the bottom there was there was yeah that's that would
00:54:49,00:54:55,have been the spot where charles dickens as a young man was put in the front window of the building
00:54:55,00:55:00,because what they used to like to show was how boot polish was going in fresh so it looked like
00:55:00,00:55:04,you're getting the best sort of stuff and he was he would sit in the window with his best friend
00:55:04,00:55:09,at the time and they would both do it together and his best friend was called fagin so fagin and
00:55:09,00:55:14,dickens used to sit in the window doing the same right and that became a tji fridays and that became
00:55:14,00:55:18,a tji fridays and it's what he would have wanted it was the best of foods it was the worst of foods
00:55:18,00:55:20,predominantly the latter
