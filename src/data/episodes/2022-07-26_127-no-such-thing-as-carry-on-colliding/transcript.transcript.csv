00:00:00,00:00:20,"And welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:20,00:00:24,"from the QI offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here with"
00:00:24,00:00:30,"Anna Chazinski, Alex Bell and James Harkin. And once again we have gathered around the microphone"
00:00:30,00:00:35,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:35,00:00:42,"Starting with you, Alex. My fact this week is that this episode of no such thing as a fish is going to"
00:00:42,00:00:51,"the moon. That's a bold claim, Mr Bell. It's absolutely true. What are you, how are we doing that?"
00:00:51,00:00:56,"Basically, a couple of years ago, I contributed to a Kickstarter campaign for a pro,"
00:00:56,00:01:02,a UK lander to go land on the moon around 2024. They hope it's called Lunar Mission 1.
00:01:02,00:01:06,"And the idea is that they're going to send it to the south pole of the moon, drill down a hundred"
00:01:06,00:01:10,meters and take some rock samples and do some science. And but also it's going to leave a time
00:01:10,00:01:14,"capsule there. And in that time capsule, people who've donated to the Kickstarter campaign"
00:01:14,00:01:17,get a little bit of digital space. And so I'm going to put this episode in.
00:01:17,00:01:22,So are you doing that because you just want to get this as far away from all things
00:01:22,00:01:26,"and existence as possible. Yep. Also, we got drunk last night and Dan had the idea and I didn't"
00:01:26,00:01:31,"reach out to say no. We got really drunk and I was like, what's definitely doing this?"
00:01:31,00:01:36,"Alex had all these plans of his family portraits to go up to the moon, my legacy gone."
00:01:36,00:01:40,"It's, it's interesting though, because it's not going up for the other eight years."
00:01:40,00:01:47,"Yeah. About, I don't know the word, about 2024 either. I've heard that before in big projects."
00:01:47,00:01:51,"But it's, it's an interesting Kickstarter because if they can pull this off, it actually just"
00:01:51,00:01:56,"completely alters how we can fund universal travel basically. I mean, we could, who knows,"
00:01:56,00:02:00,"maybe we'll be able to kickstart something tomorrow as well. Yeah, let's just try and get this"
00:02:00,00:02:06,podcast further and further away from planet rescue human society. Can I ask because they're
00:02:06,00:02:10,"drilling down and it's 150 degrees Celsius, I think, down there. Is it going to be protected in"
00:02:10,00:02:14,"some capsule? I don't know, I guess so. They haven't yet told just how much space they have"
00:02:14,00:02:18,"or anything like that. So it's still pretty vague, all the plans. God, so it might, we might have to"
00:02:18,00:02:21,just record a five minute podcast or something. We don't know how many megabytes we get. We'll just send
00:02:21,00:02:28,the Squarespace ad. Yeah. Do you know the first thing off the internet that was sent to space?
00:02:28,00:02:35,"Something off eBay. So close, but even Lamer, it is, it was a bunch of Craigslist adverts. Really?"
00:02:35,00:02:40,"Yeah, so it was in 2005 and Craigslist, the website, which I'm not sure is any longer in action."
00:02:41,00:02:48,"Oh, it is. Yeah, James is a frequent user. It's sent up about 138,000 ads. I think Craigslist ads,"
00:02:48,00:02:52,"and you could just tick a little box that said, please beam this into space and they beam them into"
00:02:52,00:02:58,"space. This was sort of digital stuff encoded onto light. Yes, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah,"
00:02:58,00:03:02,we're sending the data out there. Yeah. So I was looking this up and I found the reference on the
00:03:02,00:03:08,"Craigslist page to it after it happened, saying that they really wanted to remind people that you"
00:03:08,00:03:15,"could not cancel Craigslist ads that were beamed into space or retrieve them. So sorry guys,"
00:03:15,00:03:17,"so actually they're just going to be loads of pissed off aliens eventually coming going,"
00:03:17,00:03:23,"you said you had a sofa and I was saying, no, sorry, I sold that. That was actually what Independence"
00:03:23,00:03:28,"Day was, the fury of when they realised the sofa had now been sold. They just demolished her."
00:03:28,00:03:33,"I don't suppose lights the best thing to get your message into space, so is it? They think radio waves"
00:03:33,00:03:39,"is the best. I think it was my radio waves. Was it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So 2024, obviously quite a"
00:03:39,00:03:44,"while away for stuff for us to make it to the moon. And I thought, is that the closest that we're"
00:03:44,00:03:49,"sending probes now? But actually, there's a lot of probes that seem to be set to go. The Google"
00:03:49,00:03:56,"Lunar X Prize has been set up and the idea is that they want someone to not only land on the moon,"
00:03:56,00:04:01,"but travel 500 meters on the moon because anyone could crash a thing into the moon. The idea is,"
00:04:01,00:04:06,can you land something on the moon and make it functional and still move? So they've set up this idea
00:04:06,00:04:11,of a prize and the prize is 30 million dollars. What's interesting though is that teams have now
00:04:11,00:04:17,realised that it's going to cost them way too much to get there on their own. So a lot of them are
00:04:17,00:04:22,"pairing up now and sending all of the vehicles in one trip, which means they're going to land at the"
00:04:22,00:04:28,same time and there's going to be a moon race to see which is the first one to travel 500 meters.
00:04:28,00:04:32,It's going to be like a hunger game and as soon as they land it's just going to be absent. All the robots
00:04:32,00:04:39,are going to turn on each other. It's going to be more like robot was. I was reading of things that are
00:04:39,00:04:45,"already on the moon. I think we might have discussed a few of them before, but we as human beings"
00:04:45,00:04:52,"have left 187,400 kilograms of material on the moon and that's almost exactly the same weight as a"
00:04:52,00:04:56,"blue whale. Really? That is actually much less than I would have thought. Yeah, the largest blue whale"
00:04:56,00:05:03,"that we've ever found was 176,000, but scientists think we'll find some that are over 190,000. So"
00:05:03,00:05:07,"basically what we could have done is just taken one blue whale off the earth, put it on the moon,"
00:05:07,00:05:12,and it would have had the same effect. The moon is officially metric and not imperial. Just because
00:05:12,00:05:17,"you said kilograms, it reminded me. We've decided that. Now I have to decide what I think and then"
00:05:17,00:05:20,everyone else had to agree to it. But then given that there's only like two countries in the world
00:05:20,00:05:25,that are still imperial and I think it's America or something like Liberia or something. It would have
00:05:25,00:05:29,"been pretty weird to go with theirs. Maybe not because it's NASA. You never know. Yeah, the aliens might"
00:05:29,00:05:34,"land again and go, why are these guys using this metric system? The imperial makes much more sense."
00:05:34,00:05:38,"Well, the thing is like there's no reason why the aliens would use anything like metric. In fact,"
00:05:38,00:05:44,"they wouldn't because that metric is based on the size of the earth or the meters. Yeah. So really,"
00:05:44,00:05:48,you want to do it on like the width of a hydrogen atom or something like that. Something that will
00:05:48,00:05:52,"be universal, yeah. They might be measuring it like according to the diameter of their hands,"
00:05:52,00:05:57,which are the size of elephants or something. That's the interesting species of alien.
00:05:57,00:06:03,"You know, I didn't know about the fallen astronaut sculpture on the moon and that it's kind of a"
00:06:03,00:06:07,sad story. So this is one of the things that we've left behind on the moon is this sculpture called
00:06:07,00:06:12,the fallen astronaut and it was agreed that that would be put on the moon by this artist called
00:06:12,00:06:20,Paul van Huidonck. So he agreed with David Scott who was on the 1971 Apollo mission that he
00:06:20,00:06:25,would design a sculpture that David Scott says was supposed to represent all astronauts who had fallen
00:06:25,00:06:29,up until that point. So any astronauts who died trying to get to space or being in space and Scott
00:06:29,00:06:34,smogled it into his pocket of his space suit. So NASA didn't know nobody knew it was there and Scott
00:06:34,00:06:40,went up to the moon and he got off the spacecraft and one of his colleague astronauts distracted the
00:06:40,00:06:45,people down at mission control apparently with banal talk while he performs some kind of little
00:06:45,00:06:53,"funerals ceremony. That's the worst kind of talk to distract someone. You're right, maybe just"
00:06:53,00:06:57,"didn't have since relating talk in him. But anyway, he put this thing on the moon, gave a little funerals"
00:06:57,00:07:03,ceremony for it and he lay it down and then came back down and it was announced that this is an
00:07:03,00:07:08,hour on the moon and this argument since you'd ever since between the artist and NASA because the
00:07:08,00:07:13,"artist says A, it was meant to be standing upright and it's not. B, it doesn't represent fallen astronauts,"
00:07:13,00:07:19,it represents just humanity and see he says he never agreed that he wouldn't make it a commercial
00:07:19,00:07:22,"thing. So we tried to sell a whole bunch of them on Earth and NASA were like, no, because I think"
00:07:22,00:07:26,"you're not allowed to commercialize stuff that you've taken to the moon. So yeah, it's kind of sad."
00:07:26,00:07:30,This little sculpture on the moon is supposed to represent humanity and how great we are as now kind
00:07:30,00:07:36,of a testament to how we can't really agree on anything. I think it's weird how they always seem to
00:07:36,00:07:41,smuggle stuff into space when you can't even get toothpaste onto an airplane. I do not have that
00:07:41,00:07:44,bit where you have to empty your keys. I know that you actually have the moon boots off.
00:07:44,00:07:50,I was sort of the weirdest thing there's left on the moon was nail clippers because they only went
00:07:50,00:07:53,out there for a couple of weeks and they were trying to keep the weight down to a minimum and yet
00:07:53,00:07:56,they took nail clippers with them. Such a great point. Maybe it's like how you know your nails go a bit
00:07:56,00:08:04,"faster in summer, maybe in space your nails. This is for a 12 miles an hour. Actually it's kilometers per hour."
00:08:04,00:08:10,Sorry. I was looking into what Neil Armstrong took back from the moon and this is really interesting.
00:08:10,00:08:17,This wasn't discovered until 2012 until after Neil Armstrong died. His wife was going through his
00:08:17,00:08:21,cupboard just like in their house and there was a white bag in there. She opened it up and it had
00:08:21,00:08:31,all this stuff from the moon landing including the camera that filmed the famous. They had to
00:08:31,00:08:38,"script the lighting rig. Yeah, the camera that filmed him saying the famous words that we all"
00:08:38,00:08:43,saw that was in the bag and all these other instruments and so no one knew that he had this bag.
00:08:43,00:08:47,Usually you would leave that bag or any of the equipment that was in it on the moon as part of the
00:08:47,00:08:51,rubbish but he brought it back. He just didn't tell anyone. They went through quarantine so you think
00:08:51,00:08:55,"they'd have to show everything. Yeah, well it sounds like everyone was sneaking so it sounds like"
00:08:55,00:09:00,the security is not that tight. And then he's such a filth pig. They didn't clean his house for 50 years.
00:09:00,00:09:08,Didn't even go through his cupboards. I was reading a list of all the languages
00:09:08,00:09:12,all the greetings that we sent out into space on the Voyager Golden Record. So you know that thing
00:09:12,00:09:18,that was Carl Sagan's brainchild. We sent this thing up into space which has 55 different greetings
00:09:18,00:09:25,"and 55 different languages on it. And most people said hello or hi guys, hello to space but the"
00:09:25,00:09:34,Turkish one began with dear Turkish speaking friends. Especially since Turkish is a language
00:09:34,00:09:39,"that was created within the last 100 years as well. So if there are any assuming spaces caught on,"
00:09:39,00:09:43,there's a greeting in Amoy which is a Chinese dialect which says friends of space how are you all?
00:09:43,00:09:48,Have you eaten yet? Come visit us if you have time. That is fantastic. Come like they're offering
00:09:48,00:09:58,themselves up as dishes. Huge error. And then the last one is just I think this person got confused
00:09:58,00:10:02,because one person would receive that we're calling device to record it on. So the Swedish greeting
00:10:02,00:10:07,is greetings from a computer programmer in the little university town of Ithaca on the planet Earth
00:10:07,00:10:12,who clearly didn't quite understand he was supposed to be speaking for his speech. Is there some whale
00:10:12,00:10:19,song on there? There is yeah. One thing that's recently gone into space is the new football kit of
00:10:19,00:10:27,Reading FC. Okay. Wow. Who did a kit launch a few weeks ago and they sent their home and away
00:10:27,00:10:35,"strips up to 128,000 feet four times the cruising altitude of a passenger jet. And then they returned"
00:10:35,00:10:40,to Earth at a speed of 211 miles per hour. And the news article I read said Reading will be hoping
00:10:40,00:10:47,the team can rise as high in the table as their shirts can in altitude before presumably plummeting
00:10:47,00:10:57,down the table. Okay. It is time for fact number two and that is Chuzinski.
00:10:57,00:11:02,My fact this week is that geologists have made an earthquake by dropping something heavy from
00:11:02,00:11:10,somewhere high. Is it a Reading football kit? Are they made of iron? They wondered they're so bad.
00:11:10,00:11:15,"No, so what I like about this is I think if you were five years old and you wondered how am I going"
00:11:15,00:11:19,to make an earthquake? You just pick up a heavy object and drop it. And this seems to be what they've
00:11:19,00:11:25,done. And this is these geologists Sebastian Gueno and Stefan Brouley who are trying to simulate
00:11:25,00:11:31,earthquakes to work out the best ways to minimise damage from them. And there was just one reference I
00:11:31,00:11:37,read in a PBS article to the fact that in one test they dropped a mass of 21 tons from our height
00:11:37,00:11:42,of 164 feet to simulate an earthquake and the shaking register between two and three on the Richter
00:11:42,00:11:48,scale. And they did it another way which sounded like a more sensible way maybe by putting a vibrating
00:11:48,00:11:53,"probe thing into the ground and then vibrating it underground than that sentiment waves out,"
00:11:53,00:11:56,which is also a way to measure it. But what they're looking into is really interesting which is that
00:11:56,00:12:01,if you drill holes in the ground not particularly deep holes that dissipates the waves that come from
00:12:01,00:12:06,earthquakes. So what they did was they this was in 2012 they drilled these bore holes into the ground
00:12:06,00:12:12,just a few feet and then they generated this earthquake nearby. And the waves that they measured
00:12:12,00:12:16,"in the second row of bore holes so just 11 feet away from where they'd created the earthquake,"
00:12:16,00:12:20,the earthquake had been stopped and usually it would travel 160 feet. So these holes just deflect
00:12:20,00:12:24,the waves and cause them to go elsewhere. The problem is that they deflect them in a different direction.
00:12:24,00:12:30,So behind the bore hole suddenly was twice as much vibrations as in front of it. So it's not a good
00:12:30,00:12:33,idea for it in a city if you were doing it to protect one building you'd do it at the expense of
00:12:33,00:12:39,another one. It sounds a bit like to remember we talked about the volcanoes where they dug ditches
00:12:39,00:12:44,to move the volcanic lava away from a city into another city. It's exactly like that it's like
00:12:44,00:12:49,screwing over your neighbor by diverting the earthquake towards there. So Alex's fact was about
00:12:49,00:12:54,kickstarter doing this project to get us to the moon. And I saw this amazing crowdfunding thing
00:12:54,00:12:59,for someone's invention which is an earthquake proof bed. Have you guys seen this? Oh yes.
00:12:59,00:13:05,It's unbelievable. It's so good. It's this huge metallic contraption and the idea is that as soon as
00:13:05,00:13:11,your building or your house is in the middle of an earthquake the bed recognizes it's an earthquake
00:13:11,00:13:17,and it literally slams down in the middle. So you disappear into the middle of the bed. A huge
00:13:17,00:13:23,lid comes on top of you and you're just stuck in this bunker. I have a question. How did they make
00:13:23,00:13:27,sure that the bed can tell a difference between an earthquake and the extremely rigorous sex?
00:13:27,00:13:34,Did the earth move for you? Well it didn't but the bed thought it did.
00:13:34,00:13:41,Inside it has bottles of water. It's got oxygen tanks. It's got anything that you'd need to
00:13:41,00:13:45,survive. But how does it protect you? Because surely if you're in a house that's crumbling down
00:13:45,00:13:49,around you and you want to escape it and now you're locked in a bed. So the idea of being that this is
00:13:49,00:13:55,so strong and that house would just crumble around it but not affect the box itself. So it would give
00:13:55,00:14:01,you time to be rescued I guess. Yeah and it sends pulses out that firefighters and anyone who's
00:14:01,00:14:06,digging up the rubble can sense where you are because there's like a message and SOS message
00:14:06,00:14:11,going out. It looks nuts. There's an app you can get that I read about which is called My Shake
00:14:11,00:14:17,where you have it in your pocket and it can detect earthquakes and seismic activity
00:14:17,00:14:22,and then do real time updates so people can see when there's been earthquakes. Does it like vibrate?
00:14:22,00:14:29,Did you know you can get negative earthquakes technically because when the Richter scale was
00:14:29,00:14:34,invented it's a logarithmic scale so the smallest detectable amount of earthquakeing was one when
00:14:34,00:14:38,they've made the Richter scale and then it kind of goes up from there but since then our technology
00:14:38,00:14:42,has got better so we're able to detect even smaller earthquakes than that. So an earthquake that
00:14:42,00:14:48,registers minus one on the Richter scale is 100th the strength of an earthquake that they originally
00:14:48,00:14:53,made. Yeah it's something like a feather landing on a table or something. I remember I read an XKCD
00:14:53,00:14:58,comic about it. Oh yeah. Minus 1000 on the Richter scale would be something like you know an atom
00:14:58,00:15:02,hitting another atom or something. You'd be really annoyed if your earthquake sensing device went off
00:15:02,00:15:07,every time it sent us to minus one earthquake. How do I change the settings on this thing? Please
00:15:07,00:15:13,describe how in ancient Greece they used to mitigate earthquake damage by putting sheepskin in
00:15:13,00:15:18,the foundations of their buildings so they'd bury them put a layer of sheepskin and the idea was
00:15:18,00:15:23,that it would stop bits of earth sliding over each other and we sort of employ vaguely similar
00:15:23,00:15:27,technologies today if we put springs and stuff in the foundations of buildings. Are they trying to
00:15:27,00:15:34,put coconuts now? What? They're trying to harness coconut technology. Because coconuts are so far
00:15:34,00:15:40,advanced than we are. Because about time we use some of their technology. Yeah coconuts
00:15:40,00:15:44,apparently they're very good at absorbing certain things and they're trying to work out the
00:15:44,00:15:49,makeup of the coconut that allows for it to absorb so well that they can then apply to technology.
00:15:49,00:15:54,Should we move on soon? The one quite interesting thing about making earthquakes the father of
00:15:54,00:15:59,seismology is a guy called Robert Mallett and he was from Ireland but there aren't any earthquakes in
00:15:59,00:16:07,Ireland. The highest one ever recorded was two on the Richter scale. But what he did was he set
00:16:07,00:16:13,explosions upon the beach and measured the explosions so he's in dynamite stuff like that.
00:16:13,00:16:15,That's annoying for those on beach holidays.
00:16:19,00:16:27,Okay it is time for fact number three and that is James. Okay my fat this week is that until 1970
00:16:27,00:16:34,you could still buy men-only flights in America. This is extraordinary. It makes no sense.
00:16:34,00:16:40,Well it's sort of so explain the logic and then we'll pick it apart. So this was unised airlines
00:16:40,00:16:47,and for about two decades until 1970 you could buy these flights between New York and Chicago or
00:16:47,00:16:53,between LA and San Francisco that were from then only and the idea was I think they were for
00:16:53,00:16:59,businessmen and you're going to have no women and no children on board and according to the advert
00:16:59,00:17:05,which I saw online it said you'll enjoy the informal club-like atmosphere smoke your pie
00:17:05,00:17:10,pasta gar if you wish and make yourself comfortable using the pair of slippers provided.
00:17:10,00:17:17,I mean obviously it's ridiculous but I think they wanted to replicate the idea of a gentleman's
00:17:17,00:17:22,only club for instance which still existed then it still exists now. But the flight attendants were female.
00:17:22,00:17:28,Yes yes who famously stewardesses have had very strict appearance rules that they have to abide by
00:17:28,00:17:34,in the past so I think the very first stewardesses had to weigh less than eight stone two which is
00:17:34,00:17:39,microscopic and they had to be under 25 and less than five foot four which is extremely short.
00:17:39,00:17:44,Well so I was reading about the first student ever Ellen Church so this was for Boeing Air Transport.
00:17:44,00:17:49,She saw an advert for a cabin boys they were trying to get people more confident about air flight and
00:17:49,00:17:54,she persuaded Boeing Air Transport to give her the job on the basis that why don't you put women on
00:17:54,00:17:57,and then people will see that if women can do it then men can definitely do it. Yeah and she
00:17:57,00:18:02,was just to say she was actually a pilot. She said on your pilot if I was playing they were like
00:18:02,00:18:07,"no we don't believe you're going to fly it planes. There's only 4,000 female pilots around the"
00:18:07,00:18:13,"world out of 130,000 for a while. Wow that's nuts. But I was looking at some things she had to do and"
00:18:13,00:18:17,they had to carry a spanner and a screwdriver in their pocket so that they could fix the wicker chairs
00:18:17,00:18:21,that the passengers sat into the floor of the aircraft because apparently that was not the thing
00:18:21,00:18:25,that was already done for them and one of the other jobs is that if a plane ever had to make an
00:18:25,00:18:29,emergency landing in like a field due to bad weather they were responsible for knocking down the fences
00:18:29,00:18:34,so that it could take back off again. Because these are sort of in the early days of commercial
00:18:34,00:18:38,flights so it was mainly male planes. I mean postage. Oh yeah because that was another justification
00:18:38,00:18:42,for the small size they asked women to be. It said we need to fit as much male on board as
00:18:42,00:18:47,possible. So if you weigh 9 stone then you can't fit that extra pass much male as possible and
00:18:47,00:18:55,it's little female as possible. The first female commercial airline captain in Britain was called
00:18:55,00:19:03,Ivonne Cintes. She was a pilot for the UK based airline Dan Air from 1975 until her retirement in
00:19:03,00:19:10,1980. I'm good for you Dan. This is great. Unfortunately things went down hill for Dan Air and they
00:19:10,00:19:17,were sold to British Airways in 1992 for £1. Oh there's an airline that I found that I really like.
00:19:17,00:19:24,I hope it's still going but it was launched in 2008 and it was the world's first nude airline.
00:19:24,00:19:29,So it was for nudists. The bonus. Very quick to go through security. Yes. I thought you were saying
00:19:29,00:19:37,bonus. Yes very quick to go. So it was a very specific route that they were taking them on which
00:19:37,00:19:43,was from a German city a effort and they were going to a Baltic Sea resort. The thing was though is
00:19:43,00:19:47,that you can't arrive at the airport naked. So what they would do is they would come with their
00:19:47,00:19:52,clothes and they would get on the plate and then all take their clothes off when they were on the
00:19:52,00:19:56,plate and then what they landed all had to put their clothes back on to get off the plane. Imagine if
00:19:56,00:20:00,you're the one person who's accidentally put stickers on that and you get on that plate it takes
00:20:00,00:20:08,off and you look around like it's happening. My favourite airline I found is North
00:20:08,00:20:14,Korea's airline Air Korea. Have you seen these guys? They're the world's only airline that the
00:20:14,00:20:18,Sky Tracks has rated one star so they're the world's airline. I was looking at some of the complaints
00:20:18,00:20:23,that people have posted on including that the in-flight entertainment for the two-hour flight was
00:20:23,00:20:28,basically North Korean propaganda that the seats tilted forwards rather than backwards. The plane
00:20:28,00:20:36,came. And then during the flight both pilots came around to say hello presumably leaving the
00:20:36,00:20:44,aircraft on autopilot. Oh just on-in-flight entertainment in the 1950s when it was a rare and
00:20:44,00:20:48,exciting thing to be flying. Well first of all it was so exotic that people would wear evening
00:20:48,00:20:52,dress onto a flight so they'd you know you'd go and that's just getting on to the flight then you
00:20:52,00:20:58,take it off. And second of all you'd automatically be given a postcard when you boarded by this
00:20:58,00:21:02,geodessis and that was so the idea was that during the flight you'd write a postcard to your friends
00:21:02,00:21:08,back home talking about the flight because that's what they want to hear about. There's new services
00:21:08,00:21:13,that are happening now. KLM the world Dutch Airlines they now do a thing so you know when you're
00:21:13,00:21:17,checking in and you can select the seats that you want they're now attaching Facebook profiles to
00:21:17,00:21:23,the seats so you can actually decide who you'd like to sit next to. So there's the creepy elements
00:21:23,00:21:27,that you might sit yourself next to. Yeah and I can't think of any other element. So the
00:21:27,00:21:32,weirdly the other element for they say the other element for a lot of people is they don't want to
00:21:32,00:21:37,be near kids and so you look to where families are sitting and you can see yourself as far away from
00:21:37,00:21:41,the family. Wait is that if you first come first serve kind of thing so because surely everyone would
00:21:41,00:21:44,say I wouldn't be near that one really attractive person and no one wants to sit next so the
00:21:44,00:21:49,really smelly-looking guy. The smelly-looking guy. Yeah from his Facebook profile. He's got little
00:21:49,00:22:03,wavy lines. Okay it is time for a final fact of the show and that is my fact. My fact is that the
00:22:03,00:22:11,discovery of the Higgs Boson was announced in Comic Sans. This is the big multi-billion dollar
00:22:11,00:22:18,machine that is looking for something to unify science with a missing god particle that was found
00:22:18,00:22:25,and they chose Comic Sans the font to announce it in. Am I not? Yeah really good point. What was
00:22:25,00:22:30,amazing was if you were online at the time when the Higgs Boson was announced you probably remember
00:22:30,00:22:36,this story because it called such a huge commotion and everyone was on Twitter and all social media
00:22:36,00:22:41,making all these angry points about it including a guy called Vincent Connare who was saying there's
00:22:41,00:22:46,ridiculous that they use Comic Sans. Vincent Connare invented Comic Sans. Well his argument that he
00:22:46,00:22:56,designed it only for children. Well it was inspired by the watchman weirdly and dark night returns to
00:22:56,00:23:02,seminal comic books that couldn't be further away from the integrity that Comic Sans brings to the table.
00:23:02,00:23:07,But I'm totally on his side because he invented it. Microsoft commissioned him to design a very
00:23:07,00:23:11,friendly approachable font for a very specific program or kids and people who aren't really good at
00:23:11,00:23:15,computers. It's actually not a bad font to use for that but it's just very misused all around the
00:23:15,00:23:20,world and so this guy gets a lot of hate for inventing a font that's actually it's people using wrong
00:23:20,00:23:25,places. I think it's fine. Yeah I don't really get the big deal about it. I like it. I think it's great
00:23:25,00:23:30,but so it's sort of for children. It's just supposed to be a friendly non-aggressive non-intimidating font
00:23:30,00:23:36,so you can... Oh and then all of the aggression and aggro that this guy's got from it. Ironically
00:23:36,00:23:41,yeah. Ironically yeah. I mean there's even there's a site called bancomicSans.com it's run by a couple
00:23:41,00:23:46,who met over their hatred of Comic Sans. They got married literally. They say that's what brought
00:23:46,00:23:51,them together and they started this thing and I've seen a documentary between Vincent Connor talking
00:23:51,00:23:55,about hearing about these people and these people just discussing how much they hate it and it's
00:23:55,00:24:00,really funny because he makes his point where he says I'm so glad that my font brought them together
00:24:00,00:24:04,because now they're together for the rest of their lives. They're kind of there going don't change
00:24:04,00:24:11,the subject. Maybe they did it to make the discovery try to appear simpler to understand
00:24:11,00:24:16,than it was. If this is the purpose of Comic Sans perhaps it was to convince us that it was actually
00:24:16,00:24:20,easier to understand the expose on part of the list. I think literally that is why they picked it
00:24:20,00:24:24,in all honesty. Yeah I think they wanted to match the complexity of what they were doing with a
00:24:24,00:24:31,friendly font that said this is not meant to be scaring you. That's what I'm trying to do is throw
00:24:31,00:24:37,"it in friendly. No, Adley James have personalities James. Poms do not have personalities. You are forcing a"
00:24:37,00:24:44,personality onto these things. They're just bits of cold. Do you know that they expose on the
00:24:44,00:24:49,subject of how complex it is to comprehend? The UK Science Minister in 1993 ran a competition
00:24:49,00:24:53,to see who could provide the best explanation to the British government of what the hell it was.
00:24:53,00:24:57,The guy who won or one of the people who won was a physicist called David Miller. He described
00:24:57,00:25:01,it by saying an anonymous person could move through a crowd unhindered but if the Prime Minister
00:25:01,00:25:06,moved through a crowd he or she would attract a lot of attention so party workers would clump around
00:25:06,00:25:11,that person and slow them down and give them this metaphorical mass and that's the equivalent of
00:25:11,00:25:17,the Higgs boson. That's a very good explanation. I remember ages ago going out for a drink with a
00:25:17,00:25:22,couple of scientists here and they were saying that basically the reason that scientists were so
00:25:22,00:25:29,wanting to say yes let's find the Higgs boson is then we be able to build the LHC and what that
00:25:29,00:25:32,meant was effectively was they didn't know what they were looking for but they said it would be
00:25:32,00:25:37,the equivalent of just going out fishing and throwing your rod out into the lake with the ocean so the
00:25:37,00:25:42,Higgs boson was the excuse but actually they just wanted to go fishing. Well the Higgs boson I think
00:25:42,00:25:47,I'm right in saying there's been a bit of a disappointment because it kind of just does what
00:25:47,00:25:51,everyone expected it to do. This is confusing this is what Stephen Hawking said wasn't it? He said
00:25:51,00:25:56,it was disappointing because of that it was like surely you're happy guys you are happy but if it had
00:25:56,00:26:02,done something really weird then suddenly it opens up whole new bits of science and science becomes
00:26:02,00:26:07,really exciting. If it just fits perfectly you know it's like doing a jigsaw and you've got one more
00:26:07,00:26:12,piece in and it goes in and you're finished or if the last one doesn't go in right then maybe you've
00:26:12,00:26:17,got some other stuff wrong. I'm going to tear it apart and try it again. Maybe if they'd announced it
00:26:17,00:26:24,in a more exciting font like Wingdings or something. Just on fonts having personalities. They do not
00:26:24,00:26:30,have personalities. There was a study that suggested that you're more likely to believe that a statement
00:26:30,00:26:34,"is true if it's written in a sensible, weighty font and like Baskerville for example that's a very"
00:26:34,00:26:38,trustworthy font. Whereas Comic Sans you're not likely to believe it's true. The people who did
00:26:38,00:26:44,ban Comic Sans.com they showed examples that there's a lawyer firm in America that has their name
00:26:44,00:26:48,written in Comic Sans outside and they're going you're not going to trust that lawyer. The lawyer
00:26:48,00:26:52,who writes in Comic Sans and they said if you see something that says wet paint and it's written
00:26:52,00:26:56,in Comic Sans you're going to touch that wall and then I thought okay you lose a year I give him
00:26:56,00:27:00,yeah this is getting a bit desperate. There was a dodge wall moral that had something engraved on
00:27:00,00:27:07,it in Comic Sans which is really appropriate as well. I was looking a bit more into Surn just the
00:27:07,00:27:12,history of Surn and there's a few famous things I think a lot of people know for example the first
00:27:12,00:27:18,image that was ever put on the internet was of a band that worked at Surn. The Surnets. Yeah the Surnets.
00:27:18,00:27:23,So I just looked into them a tiny bit and it's there actually I think more people should listen to
00:27:23,00:27:28,them and check it out because it's genuinely like it's really good lyrics and really good. There's a
00:27:28,00:27:34,song called Collider and it was the song is about the frustration that Michelle DeGanaro had with the
00:27:34,00:27:39,fact that her boyfriend was always going away and working on the LHC and not spending enough time
00:27:39,00:27:42,with her because they were also busy doing what they're doing. So she wrote Collider and the lyrics are
00:27:42,00:27:47,"""I gave you a golden ring to show you my love you went to stick it in a printed circuit to fix a"
00:27:47,00:27:52,voltage leak in your collector you plug my feelings into your detector you'd never spend your nights
00:27:52,00:27:57,"with me you don't go out with other girls either you only love your Collider your Collider."""
00:27:57,00:28:03,There's a really good lyrics. Well I though yeah the thing is I'm not sure many people can really relate
00:28:03,00:28:09,to those lyrics. My boyfriend's obsessed with his Collider. Yeah a lot of people complain about
00:28:09,00:28:14,their partner's being workaholics. So what you're saying is this is basically Rihanna's work work work
00:28:14,00:28:23,exactly and I think they should too because there's a lot of plagiarism going on here. You know you know
00:28:23,00:28:27,Sun do you know what it stands for? I can't believe I didn't know this I'm got some you guys all do.
00:28:27,00:28:32,It's French but I can't remember. So it's French it stands for nothing now.
00:28:32,00:28:40,"So it was the Concer European Paula, Russia, Che, Nucleaire. So the Council for European Nuclear"
00:28:40,00:28:44,Research but the name of that was changed to the organisation of nuclear research so it should have
00:28:44,00:28:50,been OERN and this was many many years ago and they just thought OERN sounds a bit rubbish so let's
00:28:50,00:28:59,just call it Sun. OERN sounds like it could be like a carry on. Yeah carry on colliding. I think
00:28:59,00:29:05,it should be called OERN. We got anything before we move on guys. Yeah I just got one more thing on
00:29:05,00:29:09,fonts. I was just looking up kind of weird fonts and if you go to dotsys.org it's a font but they're
00:29:09,00:29:14,trying to reinvent what the alphabet is so every letter of the alphabet this person who designed
00:29:14,00:29:18,it argues is very inefficient because it takes up so much space. So what he's done is basically it's
00:29:18,00:29:22,like a couple of pixels for each letter and it's basically like braille but for the eyes if you go to
00:29:22,00:29:26,the website you can read a whole paragraph and it starts off in normal text and then the letters
00:29:26,00:29:30,get more and more distorted until you're reading something that is actually completely legible if
00:29:30,00:29:34,you look at it and it's just the weird it's just it looks a bit like sort of very condensed square
00:29:34,00:29:37,braille and then you can kind of read it. It takes a while. That's amazing. What sort of things
00:29:37,00:29:42,this shape of words? Yeah the words they start off completely in all words and then they're sort of
00:29:42,00:29:45,very distorted and you sort of you train your brain over something. That's very clever. What are we
00:29:45,00:29:50,going to do with all that amazing extra space that we're going to have at the end of each book?
00:29:50,00:29:54,It's just going to be dirty like pages. Actually you say that. The other thing I found about space
00:29:54,00:29:59,in books is that all of the Harry Potter books were printed with a size 12 font but the order of
00:29:59,00:30:04,the Phoenix was printed 0.5 small work. Oh really? The order of the Phoenix is so much longer as a book.
00:30:05,00:30:12,That's an amazing. It's like the most useless bit of information. That's going to the moon now.
00:30:12,00:30:20,That's what we're telling the universe. They're turning back. They're turning back going back
00:30:20,00:30:28,when they came from. Okay that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening to this
