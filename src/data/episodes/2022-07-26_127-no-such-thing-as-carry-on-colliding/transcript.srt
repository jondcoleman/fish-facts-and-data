00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,160
 And welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,800
 from the QI offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here with

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,080
 Anna Chazinski, Alex Bell and James Harkin. And once again we have gathered around the microphone

4
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,360
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,160
 Starting with you, Alex. My fact this week is that this episode of no such thing as a fish is going to

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:51,280
 the moon. That's a bold claim, Mr Bell. It's absolutely true. What are you, how are we doing that?

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,640
 Basically, a couple of years ago, I contributed to a Kickstarter campaign for a pro,

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,960
 a UK lander to go land on the moon around 2024. They hope it's called Lunar Mission 1.

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,960
 And the idea is that they're going to send it to the south pole of the moon, drill down a hundred

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,720
 meters and take some rock samples and do some science. And but also it's going to leave a time

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,800
 capsule there. And in that time capsule, people who've donated to the Kickstarter campaign

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,840
 get a little bit of digital space. And so I'm going to put this episode in.

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,160
 So are you doing that because you just want to get this as far away from all things

14
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,880
 and existence as possible. Yep. Also, we got drunk last night and Dan had the idea and I didn't

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,680
 reach out to say no. We got really drunk and I was like, what's definitely doing this?

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,720
 Alex had all these plans of his family portraits to go up to the moon, my legacy gone.

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,640
 It's, it's interesting though, because it's not going up for the other eight years.

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,520
 Yeah. About, I don't know the word, about 2024 either. I've heard that before in big projects.

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,600
 But it's, it's an interesting Kickstarter because if they can pull this off, it actually just

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,320
 completely alters how we can fund universal travel basically. I mean, we could, who knows,

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,000
 maybe we'll be able to kickstart something tomorrow as well. Yeah, let's just try and get this

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,320
 podcast further and further away from planet rescue human society. Can I ask because they're

23
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,800
 drilling down and it's 150 degrees Celsius, I think, down there. Is it going to be protected in

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
 some capsule? I don't know, I guess so. They haven't yet told just how much space they have

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,480
 or anything like that. So it's still pretty vague, all the plans. God, so it might, we might have to

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,920
 just record a five minute podcast or something. We don't know how many megabytes we get. We'll just send

27
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,480
 the Squarespace ad. Yeah. Do you know the first thing off the internet that was sent to space?

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,520
 Something off eBay. So close, but even Lamer, it is, it was a bunch of Craigslist adverts. Really?

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,480
 Yeah, so it was in 2005 and Craigslist, the website, which I'm not sure is any longer in action.

30
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,400
 Oh, it is. Yeah, James is a frequent user. It's sent up about 138,000 ads. I think Craigslist ads,

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
 and you could just tick a little box that said, please beam this into space and they beam them into

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,080
 space. This was sort of digital stuff encoded onto light. Yes, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,640
 we're sending the data out there. Yeah. So I was looking this up and I found the reference on the

34
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,960
 Craigslist page to it after it happened, saying that they really wanted to remind people that you

35
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,040
 could not cancel Craigslist ads that were beamed into space or retrieve them. So sorry guys,

36
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,920
 so actually they're just going to be loads of pissed off aliens eventually coming going,

37
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,680
 you said you had a sofa and I was saying, no, sorry, I sold that. That was actually what Independence

38
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,640
 Day was, the fury of when they realised the sofa had now been sold. They just demolished her.

39
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,440
 I don't suppose lights the best thing to get your message into space, so is it? They think radio waves

40
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,200
 is the best. I think it was my radio waves. Was it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So 2024, obviously quite a

41
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,720
 while away for stuff for us to make it to the moon. And I thought, is that the closest that we're

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,440
 sending probes now? But actually, there's a lot of probes that seem to be set to go. The Google

43
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,400
 Lunar X Prize has been set up and the idea is that they want someone to not only land on the moon,

44
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,920
 but travel 500 meters on the moon because anyone could crash a thing into the moon. The idea is,

45
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,160
 can you land something on the moon and make it functional and still move? So they've set up this idea

46
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,360
 of a prize and the prize is 30 million dollars. What's interesting though is that teams have now

47
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,120
 realised that it's going to cost them way too much to get there on their own. So a lot of them are

48
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,800
 pairing up now and sending all of the vehicles in one trip, which means they're going to land at the

49
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,960
 same time and there's going to be a moon race to see which is the first one to travel 500 meters.

50
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,960
 It's going to be like a hunger game and as soon as they land it's just going to be absent. All the robots

51
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,120
 are going to turn on each other. It's going to be more like robot was. I was reading of things that are

52
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,120
 already on the moon. I think we might have discussed a few of them before, but we as human beings

53
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,240
 have left 187,400 kilograms of material on the moon and that's almost exactly the same weight as a

54
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,960
 blue whale. Really? That is actually much less than I would have thought. Yeah, the largest blue whale

55
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,120
 that we've ever found was 176,000, but scientists think we'll find some that are over 190,000. So

56
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,520
 basically what we could have done is just taken one blue whale off the earth, put it on the moon,

57
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,720
 and it would have had the same effect. The moon is officially metric and not imperial. Just because

58
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,120
 you said kilograms, it reminded me. We've decided that. Now I have to decide what I think and then

59
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,880
 everyone else had to agree to it. But then given that there's only like two countries in the world

60
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,520
 that are still imperial and I think it's America or something like Liberia or something. It would have

61
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,840
 been pretty weird to go with theirs. Maybe not because it's NASA. You never know. Yeah, the aliens might

62
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,080
 land again and go, why are these guys using this metric system? The imperial makes much more sense.

63
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,080
 Well, the thing is like there's no reason why the aliens would use anything like metric. In fact,

64
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,400
 they wouldn't because that metric is based on the size of the earth or the meters. Yeah. So really,

65
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,880
 you want to do it on like the width of a hydrogen atom or something like that. Something that will

66
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,720
 be universal, yeah. They might be measuring it like according to the diameter of their hands,

67
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,680
 which are the size of elephants or something. That's the interesting species of alien.

68
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,040
 You know, I didn't know about the fallen astronaut sculpture on the moon and that it's kind of a

69
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,440
 sad story. So this is one of the things that we've left behind on the moon is this sculpture called

70
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,960
 the fallen astronaut and it was agreed that that would be put on the moon by this artist called

71
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:20,720
 Paul van Huidonck. So he agreed with David Scott who was on the 1971 Apollo mission that he

72
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,280
 would design a sculpture that David Scott says was supposed to represent all astronauts who had fallen

73
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,520
 up until that point. So any astronauts who died trying to get to space or being in space and Scott

74
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,720
 smogled it into his pocket of his space suit. So NASA didn't know nobody knew it was there and Scott

75
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,320
 went up to the moon and he got off the spacecraft and one of his colleague astronauts distracted the

76
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,200
 people down at mission control apparently with banal talk while he performs some kind of little

77
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:53,120
 funerals ceremony. That's the worst kind of talk to distract someone. You're right, maybe just

78
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,920
 didn't have since relating talk in him. But anyway, he put this thing on the moon, gave a little funerals

79
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,440
 ceremony for it and he lay it down and then came back down and it was announced that this is an

80
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,160
 hour on the moon and this argument since you'd ever since between the artist and NASA because the

81
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,520
 artist says A, it was meant to be standing upright and it's not. B, it doesn't represent fallen astronauts,

82
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,280
 it represents just humanity and see he says he never agreed that he wouldn't make it a commercial

83
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,720
 thing. So we tried to sell a whole bunch of them on Earth and NASA were like, no, because I think

84
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,640
 you're not allowed to commercialize stuff that you've taken to the moon. So yeah, it's kind of sad.

85
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,640
 This little sculpture on the moon is supposed to represent humanity and how great we are as now kind

86
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,320
 of a testament to how we can't really agree on anything. I think it's weird how they always seem to

87
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,040
 smuggle stuff into space when you can't even get toothpaste onto an airplane. I do not have that

88
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,720
 bit where you have to empty your keys. I know that you actually have the moon boots off.

89
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,160
 I was sort of the weirdest thing there's left on the moon was nail clippers because they only went

90
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,120
 out there for a couple of weeks and they were trying to keep the weight down to a minimum and yet

91
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,880
 they took nail clippers with them. Such a great point. Maybe it's like how you know your nails go a bit

92
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:04,720
 faster in summer, maybe in space your nails. This is for a 12 miles an hour. Actually it's kilometers per hour.

93
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,800
 Sorry. I was looking into what Neil Armstrong took back from the moon and this is really interesting.

94
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,120
 This wasn't discovered until 2012 until after Neil Armstrong died. His wife was going through his

95
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,840
 cupboard just like in their house and there was a white bag in there. She opened it up and it had

96
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:31,600
 all this stuff from the moon landing including the camera that filmed the famous. They had to

97
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,480
 script the lighting rig. Yeah, the camera that filmed him saying the famous words that we all

98
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,280
 saw that was in the bag and all these other instruments and so no one knew that he had this bag.

99
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,520
 Usually you would leave that bag or any of the equipment that was in it on the moon as part of the

100
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,200
 rubbish but he brought it back. He just didn't tell anyone. They went through quarantine so you think

101
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,120
 they'd have to show everything. Yeah, well it sounds like everyone was sneaking so it sounds like

102
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,880
 the security is not that tight. And then he's such a filth pig. They didn't clean his house for 50 years.

103
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,160
 Didn't even go through his cupboards. I was reading a list of all the languages

104
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,560
 all the greetings that we sent out into space on the Voyager Golden Record. So you know that thing

105
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,800
 that was Carl Sagan's brainchild. We sent this thing up into space which has 55 different greetings

106
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,840
 and 55 different languages on it. And most people said hello or hi guys, hello to space but the

107
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:34,560
 Turkish one began with dear Turkish speaking friends. Especially since Turkish is a language

108
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,200
 that was created within the last 100 years as well. So if there are any assuming spaces caught on,

109
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,760
 there's a greeting in Amoy which is a Chinese dialect which says friends of space how are you all?

110
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,720
 Have you eaten yet? Come visit us if you have time. That is fantastic. Come like they're offering

111
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:58,560
 themselves up as dishes. Huge error. And then the last one is just I think this person got confused

112
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,480
 because one person would receive that we're calling device to record it on. So the Swedish greeting

113
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,360
 is greetings from a computer programmer in the little university town of Ithaca on the planet Earth

114
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,560
 who clearly didn't quite understand he was supposed to be speaking for his speech. Is there some whale

115
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,040
 song on there? There is yeah. One thing that's recently gone into space is the new football kit of

116
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:27,520
 Reading FC. Okay. Wow. Who did a kit launch a few weeks ago and they sent their home and away

117
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:35,040
 strips up to 128,000 feet four times the cruising altitude of a passenger jet. And then they returned

118
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,880
 to Earth at a speed of 211 miles per hour. And the news article I read said Reading will be hoping

119
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,760
 the team can rise as high in the table as their shirts can in altitude before presumably plummeting

120
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:57,440
 down the table. Okay. It is time for fact number two and that is Chuzinski.

121
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,560
 My fact this week is that geologists have made an earthquake by dropping something heavy from

122
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:10,080
 somewhere high. Is it a Reading football kit? Are they made of iron? They wondered they're so bad.

123
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,280
 No, so what I like about this is I think if you were five years old and you wondered how am I going

124
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,600
 to make an earthquake? You just pick up a heavy object and drop it. And this seems to be what they've

125
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,520
 done. And this is these geologists Sebastian Gueno and Stefan Brouley who are trying to simulate

126
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,040
 earthquakes to work out the best ways to minimise damage from them. And there was just one reference I

127
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,440
 read in a PBS article to the fact that in one test they dropped a mass of 21 tons from our height

128
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,880
 of 164 feet to simulate an earthquake and the shaking register between two and three on the Richter

129
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,880
 scale. And they did it another way which sounded like a more sensible way maybe by putting a vibrating

130
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,280
 probe thing into the ground and then vibrating it underground than that sentiment waves out,

131
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,880
 which is also a way to measure it. But what they're looking into is really interesting which is that

132
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,200
 if you drill holes in the ground not particularly deep holes that dissipates the waves that come from

133
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,640
 earthquakes. So what they did was they this was in 2012 they drilled these bore holes into the ground

134
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:12,000
 just a few feet and then they generated this earthquake nearby. And the waves that they measured

135
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,160
 in the second row of bore holes so just 11 feet away from where they'd created the earthquake,

136
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,800
 the earthquake had been stopped and usually it would travel 160 feet. So these holes just deflect

137
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,960
 the waves and cause them to go elsewhere. The problem is that they deflect them in a different direction.

138
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,480
 So behind the bore hole suddenly was twice as much vibrations as in front of it. So it's not a good

139
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,840
 idea for it in a city if you were doing it to protect one building you'd do it at the expense of

140
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,120
 another one. It sounds a bit like to remember we talked about the volcanoes where they dug ditches

141
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,240
 to move the volcanic lava away from a city into another city. It's exactly like that it's like

142
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,920
 screwing over your neighbor by diverting the earthquake towards there. So Alex's fact was about

143
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,880
 kickstarter doing this project to get us to the moon. And I saw this amazing crowdfunding thing

144
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,760
 for someone's invention which is an earthquake proof bed. Have you guys seen this? Oh yes.

145
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,200
 It's unbelievable. It's so good. It's this huge metallic contraption and the idea is that as soon as

146
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,440
 your building or your house is in the middle of an earthquake the bed recognizes it's an earthquake

147
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,760
 and it literally slams down in the middle. So you disappear into the middle of the bed. A huge

148
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,600
 lid comes on top of you and you're just stuck in this bunker. I have a question. How did they make

149
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,760
 sure that the bed can tell a difference between an earthquake and the extremely rigorous sex?

150
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,320
 Did the earth move for you? Well it didn't but the bed thought it did.

151
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:41,120
 Inside it has bottles of water. It's got oxygen tanks. It's got anything that you'd need to

152
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,360
 survive. But how does it protect you? Because surely if you're in a house that's crumbling down

153
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,600
 around you and you want to escape it and now you're locked in a bed. So the idea of being that this is

154
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,360
 so strong and that house would just crumble around it but not affect the box itself. So it would give

155
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,520
 you time to be rescued I guess. Yeah and it sends pulses out that firefighters and anyone who's

156
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,240
 digging up the rubble can sense where you are because there's like a message and SOS message

157
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,840
 going out. It looks nuts. There's an app you can get that I read about which is called My Shake

158
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,040
 where you have it in your pocket and it can detect earthquakes and seismic activity

159
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,560
 and then do real time updates so people can see when there's been earthquakes. Does it like vibrate?

160
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,520
 Did you know you can get negative earthquakes technically because when the Richter scale was

161
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,960
 invented it's a logarithmic scale so the smallest detectable amount of earthquakeing was one when

162
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,480
 they've made the Richter scale and then it kind of goes up from there but since then our technology

163
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,560
 has got better so we're able to detect even smaller earthquakes than that. So an earthquake that

164
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,000
 registers minus one on the Richter scale is 100th the strength of an earthquake that they originally

165
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,280
 made. Yeah it's something like a feather landing on a table or something. I remember I read an XKCD

166
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,320
 comic about it. Oh yeah. Minus 1000 on the Richter scale would be something like you know an atom

167
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,320
 hitting another atom or something. You'd be really annoyed if your earthquake sensing device went off

168
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,920
 every time it sent us to minus one earthquake. How do I change the settings on this thing? Please

169
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,920
 describe how in ancient Greece they used to mitigate earthquake damage by putting sheepskin in

170
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,320
 the foundations of their buildings so they'd bury them put a layer of sheepskin and the idea was

171
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,040
 that it would stop bits of earth sliding over each other and we sort of employ vaguely similar

172
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,040
 technologies today if we put springs and stuff in the foundations of buildings. Are they trying to

173
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:34,000
 put coconuts now? What? They're trying to harness coconut technology. Because coconuts are so far

174
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,240
 advanced than we are. Because about time we use some of their technology. Yeah coconuts

175
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,480
 apparently they're very good at absorbing certain things and they're trying to work out the

176
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,040
 makeup of the coconut that allows for it to absorb so well that they can then apply to technology.

177
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,560
 Should we move on soon? The one quite interesting thing about making earthquakes the father of

178
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,920
 seismology is a guy called Robert Mallett and he was from Ireland but there aren't any earthquakes in

179
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:07,760
 Ireland. The highest one ever recorded was two on the Richter scale. But what he did was he set

180
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,040
 explosions upon the beach and measured the explosions so he's in dynamite stuff like that.

181
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,120
 That's annoying for those on beach holidays.

182
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:27,760
 Okay it is time for fact number three and that is James. Okay my fat this week is that until 1970

183
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:34,560
 you could still buy men-only flights in America. This is extraordinary. It makes no sense.

184
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,160
 Well it's sort of so explain the logic and then we'll pick it apart. So this was unised airlines

185
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,920
 and for about two decades until 1970 you could buy these flights between New York and Chicago or

186
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,280
 between LA and San Francisco that were from then only and the idea was I think they were for

187
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:59,280
 businessmen and you're going to have no women and no children on board and according to the advert

188
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:05,440
 which I saw online it said you'll enjoy the informal club-like atmosphere smoke your pie

189
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,560
 pasta gar if you wish and make yourself comfortable using the pair of slippers provided.

190
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:17,120
 I mean obviously it's ridiculous but I think they wanted to replicate the idea of a gentleman's

191
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,400
 only club for instance which still existed then it still exists now. But the flight attendants were female.

192
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,960
 Yes yes who famously stewardesses have had very strict appearance rules that they have to abide by

193
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,000
 in the past so I think the very first stewardesses had to weigh less than eight stone two which is

194
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,280
 microscopic and they had to be under 25 and less than five foot four which is extremely short.

195
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,320
 Well so I was reading about the first student ever Ellen Church so this was for Boeing Air Transport.

196
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,760
 She saw an advert for a cabin boys they were trying to get people more confident about air flight and

197
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,160
 she persuaded Boeing Air Transport to give her the job on the basis that why don't you put women on

198
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,840
 and then people will see that if women can do it then men can definitely do it. Yeah and she

199
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,240
 was just to say she was actually a pilot. She said on your pilot if I was playing they were like

200
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,760
 no we don't believe you're going to fly it planes. There's only 4,000 female pilots around the

201
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,680
 world out of 130,000 for a while. Wow that's nuts. But I was looking at some things she had to do and

202
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,760
 they had to carry a spanner and a screwdriver in their pocket so that they could fix the wicker chairs

203
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,280
 that the passengers sat into the floor of the aircraft because apparently that was not the thing

204
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,680
 that was already done for them and one of the other jobs is that if a plane ever had to make an

205
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,440
 emergency landing in like a field due to bad weather they were responsible for knocking down the fences

206
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,240
 so that it could take back off again. Because these are sort of in the early days of commercial

207
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,400
 flights so it was mainly male planes. I mean postage. Oh yeah because that was another justification

208
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,320
 for the small size they asked women to be. It said we need to fit as much male on board as

209
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,360
 possible. So if you weigh 9 stone then you can't fit that extra pass much male as possible and

210
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:55,040
 it's little female as possible. The first female commercial airline captain in Britain was called

211
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:03,760
 Ivonne Cintes. She was a pilot for the UK based airline Dan Air from 1975 until her retirement in

212
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,320
 1980. I'm good for you Dan. This is great. Unfortunately things went down hill for Dan Air and they

213
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,840
 were sold to British Airways in 1992 for £1. Oh there's an airline that I found that I really like.

214
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,320
 I hope it's still going but it was launched in 2008 and it was the world's first nude airline.

215
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,200
 So it was for nudists. The bonus. Very quick to go through security. Yes. I thought you were saying

216
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:37,600
 bonus. Yes very quick to go. So it was a very specific route that they were taking them on which

217
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,040
 was from a German city a effort and they were going to a Baltic Sea resort. The thing was though is

218
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,520
 that you can't arrive at the airport naked. So what they would do is they would come with their

219
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,080
 clothes and they would get on the plate and then all take their clothes off when they were on the

220
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,240
 plate and then what they landed all had to put their clothes back on to get off the plane. Imagine if

221
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,480
 you're the one person who's accidentally put stickers on that and you get on that plate it takes

222
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:08,960
 off and you look around like it's happening. My favourite airline I found is North

223
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,240
 Korea's airline Air Korea. Have you seen these guys? They're the world's only airline that the

224
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,480
 Sky Tracks has rated one star so they're the world's airline. I was looking at some of the complaints

225
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,520
 that people have posted on including that the in-flight entertainment for the two-hour flight was

226
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,560
 basically North Korean propaganda that the seats tilted forwards rather than backwards. The plane

227
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:36,560
 came. And then during the flight both pilots came around to say hello presumably leaving the

228
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:44,640
 aircraft on autopilot. Oh just on-in-flight entertainment in the 1950s when it was a rare and

229
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,240
 exciting thing to be flying. Well first of all it was so exotic that people would wear evening

230
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,240
 dress onto a flight so they'd you know you'd go and that's just getting on to the flight then you

231
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,160
 take it off. And second of all you'd automatically be given a postcard when you boarded by this

232
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,480
 geodessis and that was so the idea was that during the flight you'd write a postcard to your friends

233
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,640
 back home talking about the flight because that's what they want to hear about. There's new services

234
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,520
 that are happening now. KLM the world Dutch Airlines they now do a thing so you know when you're

235
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,600
 checking in and you can select the seats that you want they're now attaching Facebook profiles to

236
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,120
 the seats so you can actually decide who you'd like to sit next to. So there's the creepy elements

237
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,840
 that you might sit yourself next to. Yeah and I can't think of any other element. So the

238
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,560
 weirdly the other element for they say the other element for a lot of people is they don't want to

239
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,440
 be near kids and so you look to where families are sitting and you can see yourself as far away from

240
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,040
 the family. Wait is that if you first come first serve kind of thing so because surely everyone would

241
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,960
 say I wouldn't be near that one really attractive person and no one wants to sit next so the

242
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,600
 really smelly-looking guy. The smelly-looking guy. Yeah from his Facebook profile. He's got little

243
00:21:49,600 --> 00:22:03,200
 wavy lines. Okay it is time for a final fact of the show and that is my fact. My fact is that the

244
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:11,840
 discovery of the Higgs Boson was announced in Comic Sans. This is the big multi-billion dollar

245
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:18,000
 machine that is looking for something to unify science with a missing god particle that was found

246
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,920
 and they chose Comic Sans the font to announce it in. Am I not? Yeah really good point. What was

247
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,640
 amazing was if you were online at the time when the Higgs Boson was announced you probably remember

248
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,320
 this story because it called such a huge commotion and everyone was on Twitter and all social media

249
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,120
 making all these angry points about it including a guy called Vincent Connare who was saying there's

250
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,960
 ridiculous that they use Comic Sans. Vincent Connare invented Comic Sans. Well his argument that he

251
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:56,720
 designed it only for children. Well it was inspired by the watchman weirdly and dark night returns to

252
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,720
 seminal comic books that couldn't be further away from the integrity that Comic Sans brings to the table.

253
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,920
 But I'm totally on his side because he invented it. Microsoft commissioned him to design a very

254
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,840
 friendly approachable font for a very specific program or kids and people who aren't really good at

255
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,760
 computers. It's actually not a bad font to use for that but it's just very misused all around the

256
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,640
 world and so this guy gets a lot of hate for inventing a font that's actually it's people using wrong

257
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,440
 places. I think it's fine. Yeah I don't really get the big deal about it. I like it. I think it's great

258
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,400
 but so it's sort of for children. It's just supposed to be a friendly non-aggressive non-intimidating font

259
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,080
 so you can... Oh and then all of the aggression and aggro that this guy's got from it. Ironically

260
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,280
 yeah. Ironically yeah. I mean there's even there's a site called bancomicSans.com it's run by a couple

261
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,160
 who met over their hatred of Comic Sans. They got married literally. They say that's what brought

262
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,760
 them together and they started this thing and I've seen a documentary between Vincent Connor talking

263
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,760
 about hearing about these people and these people just discussing how much they hate it and it's

264
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,480
 really funny because he makes his point where he says I'm so glad that my font brought them together

265
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,960
 because now they're together for the rest of their lives. They're kind of there going don't change

266
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,040
 the subject. Maybe they did it to make the discovery try to appear simpler to understand

267
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,400
 than it was. If this is the purpose of Comic Sans perhaps it was to convince us that it was actually

268
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,240
 easier to understand the expose on part of the list. I think literally that is why they picked it

269
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,720
 in all honesty. Yeah I think they wanted to match the complexity of what they were doing with a

270
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,520
 friendly font that said this is not meant to be scaring you. That's what I'm trying to do is throw

271
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,600
 it in friendly. No, Adley James have personalities James. Poms do not have personalities. You are forcing a

272
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,320
 personality onto these things. They're just bits of cold. Do you know that they expose on the

273
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,760
 subject of how complex it is to comprehend? The UK Science Minister in 1993 ran a competition

274
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,360
 to see who could provide the best explanation to the British government of what the hell it was.

275
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,200
 The guy who won or one of the people who won was a physicist called David Miller. He described

276
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,680
 it by saying an anonymous person could move through a crowd unhindered but if the Prime Minister

277
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,960
 moved through a crowd he or she would attract a lot of attention so party workers would clump around

278
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,040
 that person and slow them down and give them this metaphorical mass and that's the equivalent of

279
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:17,120
 the Higgs boson. That's a very good explanation. I remember ages ago going out for a drink with a

280
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,000
 couple of scientists here and they were saying that basically the reason that scientists were so

281
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,120
 wanting to say yes let's find the Higgs boson is then we be able to build the LHC and what that

282
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,720
 meant was effectively was they didn't know what they were looking for but they said it would be

283
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,440
 the equivalent of just going out fishing and throwing your rod out into the lake with the ocean so the

284
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,720
 Higgs boson was the excuse but actually they just wanted to go fishing. Well the Higgs boson I think

285
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,760
 I'm right in saying there's been a bit of a disappointment because it kind of just does what

286
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,600
 everyone expected it to do. This is confusing this is what Stephen Hawking said wasn't it? He said

287
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,400
 it was disappointing because of that it was like surely you're happy guys you are happy but if it had

288
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,000
 done something really weird then suddenly it opens up whole new bits of science and science becomes

289
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,680
 really exciting. If it just fits perfectly you know it's like doing a jigsaw and you've got one more

290
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,480
 piece in and it goes in and you're finished or if the last one doesn't go in right then maybe you've

291
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,120
 got some other stuff wrong. I'm going to tear it apart and try it again. Maybe if they'd announced it

292
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:24,480
 in a more exciting font like Wingdings or something. Just on fonts having personalities. They do not

293
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,080
 have personalities. There was a study that suggested that you're more likely to believe that a statement

294
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,320
 is true if it's written in a sensible, weighty font and like Baskerville for example that's a very

295
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,400
 trustworthy font. Whereas Comic Sans you're not likely to believe it's true. The people who did

296
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,560
 ban Comic Sans.com they showed examples that there's a lawyer firm in America that has their name

297
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,560
 written in Comic Sans outside and they're going you're not going to trust that lawyer. The lawyer

298
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,480
 who writes in Comic Sans and they said if you see something that says wet paint and it's written

299
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,080
 in Comic Sans you're going to touch that wall and then I thought okay you lose a year I give him

300
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,880
 yeah this is getting a bit desperate. There was a dodge wall moral that had something engraved on

301
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,440
 it in Comic Sans which is really appropriate as well. I was looking a bit more into Surn just the

302
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,160
 history of Surn and there's a few famous things I think a lot of people know for example the first

303
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,800
 image that was ever put on the internet was of a band that worked at Surn. The Surnets. Yeah the Surnets.

304
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,360
 So I just looked into them a tiny bit and it's there actually I think more people should listen to

305
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,560
 them and check it out because it's genuinely like it's really good lyrics and really good. There's a

306
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:34,400
 song called Collider and it was the song is about the frustration that Michelle DeGanaro had with the

307
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,600
 fact that her boyfriend was always going away and working on the LHC and not spending enough time

308
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,880
 with her because they were also busy doing what they're doing. So she wrote Collider and the lyrics are

309
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,680
 "I gave you a golden ring to show you my love you went to stick it in a printed circuit to fix a

310
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,320
 voltage leak in your collector you plug my feelings into your detector you'd never spend your nights

311
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,040
 with me you don't go out with other girls either you only love your Collider your Collider."

312
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:03,520
 There's a really good lyrics. Well I though yeah the thing is I'm not sure many people can really relate

313
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,200
 to those lyrics. My boyfriend's obsessed with his Collider. Yeah a lot of people complain about

314
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,240
 their partner's being workaholics. So what you're saying is this is basically Rihanna's work work work

315
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:23,360
 exactly and I think they should too because there's a lot of plagiarism going on here. You know you know

316
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,200
 Sun do you know what it stands for? I can't believe I didn't know this I'm got some you guys all do.

317
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,960
 It's French but I can't remember. So it's French it stands for nothing now.

318
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:40,560
 So it was the Concer European Paula, Russia, Che, Nucleaire. So the Council for European Nuclear

319
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,640
 Research but the name of that was changed to the organisation of nuclear research so it should have

320
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,560
 been OERN and this was many many years ago and they just thought OERN sounds a bit rubbish so let's

321
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:59,440
 just call it Sun. OERN sounds like it could be like a carry on. Yeah carry on colliding. I think

322
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,040
 it should be called OERN. We got anything before we move on guys. Yeah I just got one more thing on

323
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,840
 fonts. I was just looking up kind of weird fonts and if you go to dotsys.org it's a font but they're

324
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,800
 trying to reinvent what the alphabet is so every letter of the alphabet this person who designed

325
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,960
 it argues is very inefficient because it takes up so much space. So what he's done is basically it's

326
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,960
 like a couple of pixels for each letter and it's basically like braille but for the eyes if you go to

327
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,960
 the website you can read a whole paragraph and it starts off in normal text and then the letters

328
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,400
 get more and more distorted until you're reading something that is actually completely legible if

329
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,160
 you look at it and it's just the weird it's just it looks a bit like sort of very condensed square

330
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,920
 braille and then you can kind of read it. It takes a while. That's amazing. What sort of things

331
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,000
 this shape of words? Yeah the words they start off completely in all words and then they're sort of

332
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,680
 very distorted and you sort of you train your brain over something. That's very clever. What are we

333
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,080
 going to do with all that amazing extra space that we're going to have at the end of each book?

334
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,640
 It's just going to be dirty like pages. Actually you say that. The other thing I found about space

335
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,440
 in books is that all of the Harry Potter books were printed with a size 12 font but the order of

336
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,160
 the Phoenix was printed 0.5 small work. Oh really? The order of the Phoenix is so much longer as a book.

337
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:12,000
 That's an amazing. It's like the most useless bit of information. That's going to the moon now.

338
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:20,320
 That's what we're telling the universe. They're turning back. They're turning back going back

339
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:28,640
 when they came from. Okay that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening to this

340
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,760
 special made for the moon episode. If you would like to get in contact with any of us about the things

341
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:40,800
 that we have said, you can't. We all died in 2023. It's a tragic explosion at the QI office.

342
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:51,520
 I'm still in the bed somewhere. Please locate James or tweet him on James at X-shaped or you

343
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:58,320
 can tweet me on at Shriveland Alex Alex Boer underscore and Shazinski. You can email podcast at qi.com.

344
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,120
 Yep or you can go to at qi podcast which is our group account or go to our website. No such thing

345
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,400
 as a fish.com where all of our previous episodes are waiting to be listened to. We'll see you again

346
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:18,400
 next week. Goodbye.

347
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,980
