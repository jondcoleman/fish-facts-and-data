00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,180
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Little Fish. We've been so happy to get

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,080
 a message from you guys to say that you've been enjoying this show and we certainly enjoy

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,440
 making it. It's a little bit more loose, a little bit more silly than the normal shows,

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,120
 but we really, really love getting your facts so please do keep sending those in.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,480
 The reason I've disturbed the start of your show today is because I want to tell you about

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,880
 a quiz that we're doing. It is for Patreon subscribers on the top tier and it will take

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,200
 place on the 23rd of January at 7pm UK time, so that'll be sometime in the afternoon

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,360
 if you're in North America and it'll be very early in the morning if you're in Australia

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,440
 or New Zealand, but hopefully you will still be able to join us. It's going to be a whole

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,740
 load of fun. We've got loads of amazing stuff planned for you and if you are not a member

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,460
 of Patreon right now, then you have to go to patreon.com/nosuchthingsaffish and join

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,500
 our top tier. You could probably just do it for a month and then quit if you just want

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,860
 to do the quiz, but honestly there's so much good stuff on our Patreon that I really think

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,740
 once you join you will be hooked because we have extra content, we have merch, we have

15
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,980
 video content, there's all sorts of stuff on there. We hope we've made it value for money

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,420
 because people going on there help to support the podcast so it is a real good mutual benefit

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:33,300
 to think anyway, enough of that, really hope you enjoyed this episode of Little Fish.

18
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:46,260
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Little Fish. This is your regular show where

19
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,700
 we talk about your facts and then at the very end we will be telling you some of our old

20
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:58,220
 facts and putting them under the custodianship of some friend of the podcast patrons. So let's

21
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:05,220
 not chat any longer, not that we've been chatty so far enough of this banter. In my head

22
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,680
 it's bad to be talking to myself, but no, let us talk about your facts. So who is going

23
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:18,260
 to give me the first fact, me for the day, me, me, me, dad? Oh come on. I've got such a

24
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,760
 good one, this is from Alex Hadley, I just love this, right? Alex writes, my fact that I've

25
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,040
 not seen written anywhere. Oh, I love those fresh facts, lovely. Is that Cany Tanaka, the

26
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,680
 second-oldest verified person, is the only human in existence who lived through the first

27
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:42,240
 Powered Flight on Earth and the first Powered Flight on Mars. Mars? Yes. This is so good,

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,920
 right? She was born in January 1903. The first Powered Flight happened in December 1903,

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,180
 if you believe the government lies about it. That's a joke. They did it. I mean, she would

30
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,960
 not have really been that aware of it. Alex does actually probably didn't care about

31
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,360
 that. Yeah, I know. Like, she probably didn't care about the

32
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,680
 Mars thing. She was over a hundred years old at the time. Isn't that the sad thing really

33
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,680
 about whole of human existence, really, that two of these incredibly important things happen

34
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,320
 in this one person's life, and she did not give a shit about either of them. We are speculating

35
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,640
 about the Mars one. We are speculating she might have absolutely

36
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,720
 been over it. Yeah, you might have been. So she was born in January 1903. Right, brothers

37
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,580
 have their flight. December 1903. She died in April 2022. So what's that? 19 Good Lord.

38
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,960
 And the ingenuity helicopter had a Powered Flight on Mars in April 2021. She was the only

39
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,160
 person alive during both those events. That's a very good fact. That is also very good.

40
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:48,160
 And we are assuming that her claim of being 119 is true, which as we've said on the

41
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,320
 fuck has quite a few times that anyone over 110. You have to take with a slight pinch of

42
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,080
 shit. Yeah, yeah. I think there were quite good records for her in particular. I mean,

43
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:05,220
 she was born in 1903. She got married in 1922. And she lived until 2022. It's just got

44
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,960
 better. I mean, I would say I got married a hundred years ago. It's so bad. Because is

45
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,760
 she the number, the number two oldest person after Jen come on? Yes, who I think there are

46
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,640
 quite good questions. So she, this person could be the oldest person ever. Does a good

47
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,240
 point, actually, yeah. Yeah, yeah, she might well be. What do you get for your hundredth anniversary?

48
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:32,160
 Incontinence. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, there's a fact that I really like, which is that

49
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:40,640
 Buzz Aldrin's dad was a pilot and he knew and worked in the same barracks at an army place with

50
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,800
 one of the Wright brothers. Yes. So he knew him. They would have been friendly with each other.

51
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,200
 So for him to witness flight in his own lifetime and then witness his son be the first person

52
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:56,240
 land on the moon, that's got to be a pretty wild second person. If you believe what the government

53
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,880
 tells you, yeah, I would the government's kind of huge conspiracy that they did go to the moon,

54
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,640
 but Neil was first, or is actually it was five? Have you ever met Buzz Aldrin? You briefly. Yeah.

55
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,400
 So could you imagine why they would prefer meals be the first? Because Buzz is terrifying. Yeah.

56
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,280
 He's a, he's an angry guy. He is. He was pretty terrifying. I was brilliant. Yeah, yeah.

57
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,880
 I met him because he was doing the museumicurial steward. You guys were producing at the time. Yes.

58
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,640
 Yes. Yes. That is correct. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Great fact. Okay. Dad. Yeah, I go on here.

59
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:35,040
 This one is sent in by Mike Boone. Mike Boone says the greatest spy scandal in New Zealand history

60
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,240
 occurred in 1981 when a member of the secret intelligence service lost his work briefcase

61
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,280
 somewhere in Wellington. It was eventually discovered by a ten-year-old boy and it contained three

62
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,240
 pies and a porn magazine. Now this, it's enough that a ten-year-old boy has found it and then

63
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,680
 someone's discovered this, right? Yes. It must be the worst feeling in the world when you're this

64
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,680
 spy and you find out the ten-year-old boy was the son of Fran O'Sullivan, who was a leading award-winning

65
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,760
 journalist in New Zealand. So he came to his mum and said, I found this briefcase and she opened it

66
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,960
 and blew the story wide open. Yeah, it had, there's different descriptions of what was in it,

67
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,000
 three cold oval meat pies were in the briefcase, two slices of cake, copies of the latest listener and

68
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,280
 penthouse. There was also three identity cards, the man's letters of appointment to the SIS,

69
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,400
 the secret intelligence service. Well, it's going to say, if you just have three pies and a porn

70
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,640
 magazine, that's untraceable to you. The perfect spy is briefcase, actually. Yes. In fact,

71
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,680
 it was a really good spy's briefcase because it doesn't make you seem like a spy, it makes these

72
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,440
 even a bit weird. It makes you seem like a very hungry clever. So completely undone, unfortunately,

73
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,600
 by that. I've not read that, children's books, they're very hungry clever.

74
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:54,160
 Tuesday, he had three pies and you read a copy of hustle. But yeah, I mean, you're right and

75
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,000
 completely unfortunate that it was undone by the fact that he literally had the letter that said,

76
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,320
 congratulations, you were now a spy. Treat yourself to this voucher for any three pies of your

77
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:13,200
 choice. Wow. Yeah. That's extraordinary. Yeah. I didn't know much about the Kiwi spying services,

78
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,920
 to be honest. No. I think Kiwi James Bond is a fun idea. Yeah. We spoke about when Restarby

79
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,440
 was on the show on Nancy. I can't remember her name now. She cruddy chopped a Nazi to death.

80
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,440
 She was a New Zealand spy. She was amazing. You weren't that one, were you Andy?

81
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,240
 Yeah, you weren't in that one. That's right. I was there. Yeah. There was also that story in the

82
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,040
 news about the fact that a lot of countries were asked to identify the spies in their countries

83
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,040
 and kick them out in New Zealand said, oh, we had a look. Can't find any. And that was that.

84
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:58,000
 Very good. Okay. Here is a fact from Julian Sean. And Julian writes about the excessive

85
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,800
 mountaineering tourism on Mount Everest and the huge problem it has caused with human waste

86
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:13,040
 leading to the so-called Mount Everest poop slide. And apparently this is people

87
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,960
 pooing on Mount Everest and the poos don't just stay up there. A poo boulder will roll down the

88
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:26,400
 mountain when the ice melts. And they will often end up in drinking sauces. Wow. So this is a

89
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,120
 huge problem. And now if you climb up there, they give you special bags with chemicals in

90
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,120
 that you have to poo into and then take them back down again where they came from.

91
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,240
 Do you poo into the bag or do you do a poo and then pick up after yourself as if you were the dog?

92
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,200
 Dealers choice. Yeah, I guess so. As long as the poo ends off in the bag, that's fine. It doesn't really

93
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,120
 matter. Yeah. I think I would probably do a poo and then wait a couple of hours for it to freeze

94
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,360
 and then put it in the bag. That's a good idea. That's a good idea. Yes. I would have a swap

95
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,080
 system going with one of the other mountaineers. Oh, well I don't go mountaineering with you.

96
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,560
 Well, I'm doing a poo. The other mountaineer stands around awkwardly like pretending he can't see me

97
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,520
 like a dog on a wood. We're only going for a walk of the Cheviets.

98
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,920
 Break the bags. My favourite advice that Brian Blessed always gives about Mount Everest

99
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,320
 is he says and is to do with pooing. It says never camp below the French because the

100
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,560
 bastards will shit on you from any height. And supposedly that would be a worry is that in his

101
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,600
 experience. He's not camped under every nationality in the world. I don't think it's fair to blame

102
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,720
 the French. It's coming with no judgment from me. I'm just reporting on the man.

103
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,240
 Well, I had a quick look at this problem on Mount Everest and I found that the 2019

104
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:57,040
 amount of human feces was 7,200 kilograms in a single season. And that is the same weight as

105
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:05,280
 Vladimir Putin's armoured limousine. Putin. You took away from my brilliant comparison now

106
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:12,480
 with your lame Putin joke. I think you both got something to be blamed for there.

107
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,680
 Oh, okay, fine. Well, why don't you give us something better than I think? Oh gosh, all right.

108
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,880
 Here's a fact from Michael West. Have you guys heard of AMF bowling? You might down because in Australia

109
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,480
 it's a major chain of 10 pin bowling centers. Oh, I haven't heard of it now. Michael is writing

110
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,640
 from Sydney. I hope it's not Michael from West Sydney. No, I think it's Michael West from Sydney.

111
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,920
 Anyway, he showed it's not Sydney West from Michael. That's it. So Michael says,

112
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,560
 here in Australia, AMF is a major chain of 10 pin bowling centers. Imagine my surprise to learn

113
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:51,440
 that AMF built the first nuclear reactors in Iran, Pakistan, and Israel, the same company. Same company.

114
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,840
 This is insane. Wow. There was this firm called American Machine and Foundry. They haven't

115
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,000
 existed since the 90s now, but basically they made everything. They made bowling equipment.

116
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,280
 They made pretzel bending machines. They made the silos for American nukes and they made nuclear

117
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:14,160
 reactors for these countries around the world. It's insane. They just really got it making

118
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,520
 weird machines. Yeah. They made tennis rackets, bicycles, scuba gear, remote planes,

119
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,480
 and ballistic missile launching systems. Wow. That's sick. And they're responsible for something.

120
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,800
 I think this is something you're interested in James. They put thousands of people out of work

121
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,840
 with one of these inventors. Oh, I love putting people out of work. One of my main hobbies that,

122
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:43,520
 yeah, I love it. I mean, this is an area you've done a fact about in the past. Come on then.

123
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,600
 Well, what did bowling, what did these bowling machines, who did they put out of work?

124
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,600
 Oh, the pinboys. The pinboys. Yeah. That is interesting. Thousands of boys used to just hang around

125
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,480
 at the other end of a bowling alley, putting the pins back up. Yeah, they did. And then if you were

126
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,080
 nice to them, they'd put the pins close together to make it easier to not come down. Yeah. That's great.

127
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:10,880
 Did you have to like just put a little note in some money in the hole, maybe, and then like the next

128
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,920
 time you came? Well, basically, I think the other thing is if they just didn't like the luck of you,

129
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,920
 they would make things more difficult. That's funny. Probably put chewing gum underneath the pins.

130
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,000
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you're in a date and you want to impress, you have to say to them, you know,

131
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,280
 you put these pinboys close, you just knock them over, please. Yeah. Look at that. And they're playing

132
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,160
 your date turns round and then, oh, wow. I thought you went straight in the gutter. No.

133
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,200
 Is that a new de-reactor being transported over to? No, I believe that's a pretzel turning machine.

134
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,600
 What a pivot from what they were doing to bowling. Very unclear which way they pivoted first.

135
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,680
 I think they might have done the bowling first. Right. And then, no, you know, we could use this

136
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,240
 for either way. We sort of started a chain reaction in with those balls. I don't think so because if

137
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,360
 you're Iran and you need someone to build your new clear reactor and someone comes over and goes,

138
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,480
 well, we're a pretzel bending and a bowling machine company. You're not going to trust them.

139
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,400
 Whereas if you want to make pretzels, if someone comes up to you and says, well, we also make new

140
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,320
 clear reactors, you're going to go, oh, you guys know yours. Yeah. You're right. You're absolutely right.

141
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,400
 Yeah. You have to build down. You have to build down. Start with the girl. I always say, start with

142
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,720
 something incredibly complicated. And then, you know, see if you can make a bit of pretzel money on the side.

143
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:30,960
 Thank you, Michael. Um, who's next, dad? Yeah, I got one. This is from Tom Worth. This is a fact

144
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:38,320
 about CGI in movies and in Jurassic Park in particular. So he says the T-Rex attack scene in Jurassic

145
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,360
 Park with the lawyer character runs out the car into a nearby hut and is eaten as he's sitting on

146
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,240
 the toilet. That's a CGI shot. So they needed a CGI human for it as well. They couldn't use an

147
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,760
 actual human. Okay. Um, but this was the early days of CGI. And it didn't make sense to build a whole

148
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,160
 new CGI human for literally one shot where you see him from behind in that distance. So they decided

149
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,680
 we'll reuse the CGI human that we've already used in another movie. So just it was a recycled

150
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:13,920
 bit of human for CGI. So Jurassic Park, what, 19, what bit like? 94 or 5? So it's got to be a movie that

151
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,120
 came out in the early 90s. Yeah. Is this something we can guess? Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's a blockbuster movie.

152
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:29,520
 From the early 90s in the religions. It's not one of the alien movies. No, it's not. No, the CGI

153
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,840
 human that you see being eaten by the T-Rex in Jurassic Park is in fact T-1000, the Terminator.

154
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,800
 I'm just going to say that from Terminator 2. Oh my gosh, that's brilliant. It's not great.

155
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,000
 That's very pleasing. Can we say that they're in the same universe maybe? Oh, yeah, exactly.

156
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,560
 Yeah, they are. Yeah, great idea. I think Terminator vs. Dinosaur is the movie we're all waiting for.

157
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,520
 They send a dinosaur forward in time to kill John Connor. You know what I'm saying? And then they

158
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:05,200
 have to just like deal with a robot dinosaur. Come on. Come on, guys, come on. No, the opening,

159
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,000
 the opening scene is Jurassic Park and we see them going off. But then we cut back to the

160
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,720
 hut and the chewed up man stands up and you can see half his face is cyborg. That's good. And we go

161
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,920
 from there. Where do we go? This thing writes itself, guys. I think you'll find if you just put that

162
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,280
 sentence into chat Tp2, you let it do the rest. Yeah, I think where we probably goes, we turn back

163
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:40,000
 to Jurassic Park, which is an actual good movie. We just watch that. Here is an amazing one from

164
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,560
 Charles Hargrove. And Charles says that the inuit of the North American Arctic used to treat

165
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:53,440
 snow blindness by tying a louse to a human hair and walking it across the affected eyeball.

166
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,400
 What? What indeed? It doesn't make any sense, but it is from the

167
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,840
 Avatar cultural institute in Nunnerbuck. So this is a very, very good sauce.

168
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,600
 What is? I don't really know what snow blindness does to you. I mean, I can sort of guess is that

169
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,040
 you just you can't differentiate things with your eyes anymore because it's all so quiet.

170
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,800
 Yeah, I think that's what it is. But I think there is some physical stuff that happens

171
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,480
 because I went on to the website and read about it. And apparently the idea is that you walk

172
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:30,400
 this louse across your eyeball and the film sticks to the louse's feet. No way. And according to this

173
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,720
 website, you need several lice because lice are small and get tired real fast. And the procedure

174
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,000
 is no longer used because we don't have hair lice anymore. Oh, that's such a shame. Yeah.

175
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 That must be some other reasons why we don't do that anymore. But flies with the wings tied down

176
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,080
 maybe used in the same way. How are you tying down a fly's wings? Sorry. With more human hair, I guess.

177
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:57,440
 Do you mean that they don't have human lice out there? Yeah, these guys. I know human lice do

178
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,520
 exist. Oh, I'm gonna say I could send my kids over. Imagine you make a killing. I would.

179
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,520
 Some of the things they use to treat snow blindness. Tamegan breast laid on top of the

180
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,360
 eyelids. And apparently if you do that, the patient should not eat any tamegan for a while.

181
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,680
 Or some square flipper seal fat applied directly to the eye. Should you not eat the tamegan

182
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,480
 because then you're out of tamegan. Should you need to put them on your eyes again? Or has it

183
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,400
 has what what an interesting connection that you shouldn't eat it if it's been on your eyes.

184
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:37,440
 I think a lot of this is cultural sort of. Oh, flour and stuff like that. I do wonder if some of it

185
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,800
 is just people from that area taking the piss when anthropologists come over and go, yeah,

186
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:49,040
 what we do is we retire hair loss to an eyelash and let it walk crush your eyes. I always think that

187
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,680
 when I see those dogs, particularly like the weird ancient alien ones where like they're out in

188
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,640
 some jungle and some old 90 year old woman is going and alien landed down here. I can picture

189
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,080
 everyone else going, why do they keep interviewing mad Sally? What's going on about aliens again?

190
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,920
 It's not case. Yeah, but it is on the official website dedicated to preserving and promoting

191
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:17,280
 inuit language. Wow. So the sauce is good. So cool. That's fantastic. Yeah. Okay, we've got time

192
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:25,280
 for one more maybe. Yeah, I got one here. This is from Jodacus Mordant. Apologies, Jodacus. I'm reading

193
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,240
 your name as I see it. Zoologist. And they say they're constantly learning about animals on Velton,

194
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:39,520
 which is their sensory world. Oh, Velton. Yeah, very good. So he says here's my favorite one from

195
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,000
 this week, star-nosed moles can forage underwater. They can purposefully blow air bubbles and then

196
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,480
 re-enhail them to detect sense from potential prey. Not to mention that their star is 13 times

197
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,400
 more sensitive than a human clitoris, which I think I learned from your show. You did. I looked it

198
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,880
 up. That was in an episode called No Such Thing as the Malt Street Journal. And what was the other

199
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,440
 fact about the star-nosed moles? They can blow purposely blow air bubbles and then re-enhail them to

200
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,760
 detect sense from potential prey. Velton is really interesting because that's the idea that you just

201
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:21,680
 don't know how any other animal is experiencing the world. Right? So if an electric eel goes through

202
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,840
 the water and it can tell where things are because it has an electric force somehow detects things,

203
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:34,560
 or if a bat is somehow detecting things using clicks and bouncing ultrasound off walls and stuff,

204
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:40,240
 we just have no idea of knowing what that's like. We can kind of come up with an analogy or whatever,

205
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,560
 but really you just don't know what it's like to be a horse or a lion or a nat. Even really close

206
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,880
 animals to us, even chimpanzee. We don't know if they're looking at us as if we're other chimpanzees,

207
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,680
 or whether we're this weird sort of different animal or more. I wonder what the closest animal is

208
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,360
 where we feel like we're getting closer to understanding the deception of the world. Whatever's been

209
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,960
 studied most, I guess, dolphins and... Drugs. Yeah, dogs. Gilly pigs. Because designing a VR headset

210
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,000
 game where you were existing with their vision with their, you know, dogs seem black and white,

211
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,280
 is that right? Yeah, but they smell a lot. Yep. So you'll have to have a VR big VR nose. Yes. But then

212
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,160
 the nose would have to give you so many smells, you wouldn't know what to do with them. You wouldn't

213
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,560
 be able to differentiate between them. You'll be just like, this smells a bit meaty. Yeah. But actually,

214
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,720
 it could be venison over there and dog shit over there. And, you know, like you just can't experience

215
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,800
 what it's like to be able to tell all those different smells of what. What does Andy keep smelling

216
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,240
 everyone's ass when they come and say hi to him? He took the helmet off. He's okay.

217
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:53,600
 Is someone going to pick up after me or not? What way separate to freeze?

218
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:03,120
 Okay. On that note, I think we should maybe go to our second section of this show, which is to look

219
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:10,160
 at some of our old facts and give them a new home. So, Andy, do you have the first person who is a

220
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:16,560
 new custodian of a No-Shoes Thing as a Fish Facts? Yes. First friend of the podcast to be assigned

221
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:22,160
 their brief. This week is Richard Martin. Congratulations, Richard. Your fact is an absolute classic.

222
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:29,520
 It's that the first known football chant was composed by Edward Elgar. Yeah. I think a lot of

223
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,800
 a lot of things you hear shout out on the terraces have actually been composed by eminent composers,

224
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,720
 is that right? Yeah, the referees of Wanker. That was by Schoenberg. Yeah, absolutely.

225
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:46,000
 Who's the bastard in the black? Who was that? It was... Was it Rimsky Karsikoff for? I can't remember.

226
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,520
 I think it was Prokofiev, but I'm not certain. I always get the mixed up. Yeah, no, no, no, no.

227
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,120
 I always get the Russian composers out of here. The one that goes... When you're taking the piss out

228
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:03,680
 of the other fans for not making any noise. John Cage? John Cage? Lovely. There you go, Richard.

229
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:09,280
 That's your fact, though. Dan, let's have the next one. Yeah, this fact is for Catherine,

230
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,560
 and this was my fact, and it's from episode 17, as was the last fact, and that is Eric Cantana

231
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,680
 was raised in a cave. Is this... This must have been a football special. I think it was a

232
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,080
 World Cup final. It absolutely was. I can see the next two facts. Was there a World Cup in 2014?

233
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,600
 There was. My favourite Eric Cantana fact from... I didn't even mention that episode. I can't

234
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:37,200
 really remember. It was people used to sing "U" "Ah, Cantana." And that was composed by Camille Sanson.

235
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:46,320
 Was it? God, you really got me. You really got me. Eric Cantana has the record for the most

236
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,480
 kicks to someone else's head in one minute. Call back for you, though. Very good. Very nice.

237
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,880
 Okay, Tiffany Gregory, you've been waiting for your name, and here it is, and will we find out

238
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,320
 what fact you are now the custodian over? Yes, we will. It is... Oh, it's a bit of a long,

239
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,200
 a bit of a mouthful, apologies for this. In the first World Cup final in 1930,

240
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,200
 Uruguay and Argentina couldn't agree on the size of the ball. So you used Argentina's small ball

241
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,480
 at the first half, and Uruguay's big one in the second half. It's lovely. It's a lovely idea.

242
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,600
 It also implies that people from Uruguay sort of multiple times the size of people from Argentina.

243
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:32,480
 The size of the ball was not that different. I don't think I've seen at least one of these balls

244
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:39,680
 in the design museum in London quite recently, and they are quite similar in size. But still, I mean...

245
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,600
 It'll freak you out a bit, wouldn't it? You'd probably play your best game with the ball that you

246
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,200
 were used to. Yeah, yeah. It wasn't like they were used in the marble for the first half,

247
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,120
 but it's big 12 for the second half. Sure, another fact. Yeah, go on, Andy.

248
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,000
 Right. This goes out to Rita Hoffmeier. Rita, thank you so much for becoming a friend of the

249
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,760
 podcast, and here is your fact is that FIFA has more members than the UN. A famously ineffective,

250
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:12,640
 sclerotic and corrupt organisation, the UN remains in business. This was a debut fact,

251
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,480
 by the way, Rita, from the creator of QI, John Lloyd. Yeah. Very first appearance onto fish.

252
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:25,440
 This is really exciting though, because you guys don't know this, but I can say that Rita Hoffmeier,

253
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,440
 as well as becoming custodian of this fact, you are also going to receive the No Such Thing as a Fish

254
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:39,600
 Peace Prize. Oh, that's huge news. It's huge. It's huge. Obviously, for all of the great stuff that

255
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,720
 you've done to stop wars in the world, we've decided that you should get it. Yeah, congratulations, Rita.

256
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,960
 Dan, another one. Yeah, so we've jumping over to episode 18 now, and this is a fact that's going out

257
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,760
 to Cara Riley, and this is a fact that was from one of our guests on that show, Richard Turner.

258
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:04,160
 Richard Turner is the co-creator and producer of Museum of Curiosity, which is a show that me and

259
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,440
 James Harkin worked on for many, many years. He's a really, really good friend. And Richard's fact

260
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,280
 is that when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, he was wearing Ladies Underwear. Very good.

261
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,560
 I can't 100% remember. It wasn't. I was a slight stretch. I think it was that the stretch,

262
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:28,640
 a stretch, but very comfortable and very forgiving. It was that the undergarments of the space

263
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,560
 it would made by playtacks, I think, that also made undergarments. That's right. Separately, he was in a thong.

264
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:45,600
 Okay. I will do one more. This one is now under the custodianship of Ben Newman.

265
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:55,040
 Ben, this is your fact. It is that in 1963, Muhammad Ali released a stand-up comedy album

266
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:01,280
 called "I Am The Greatest". That's right. That's right. That's right, the special. I saw that album in

267
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,400
 an HMV, which is where I got the fact from. I was going through the stand-up comedy CDs,

268
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,040
 and it was just sitting there, and I was like, "What the hell is this?" And did some googling, and yeah,

269
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,120
 it turned out... Is it funny? He was an incredibly funny guy. I don't know if you've ever seen

270
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,960
 interviews with him. He just had a great way with words. He had, sort of, anytime he was trying to

271
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,160
 roast his opponent, he did very well at that. Yeah, it was funny. So what it was, it wasn't him on stage,

272
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:32,320
 explicitly coming out like he's Jerry Seinfeld. He was doing talks around the world, and they were

273
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,800
 recording them, and so this was a compilation of all those talks. I think it had poetry as well,

274
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,960
 that he'd written. I haven't listened to the CD in a while, so I can't remember it, but yeah.

275
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,360
 This goes out to Nicky Kelly, congratulations Nicky, and it's the fact that in 1325 in Italy,

276
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:54,960
 war was declared, and 2,000 people killed because a bucket was stolen. Oh, dear. I know. This was the

277
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,360
 war of the Okan bucket between Bologna and Modena, and some modernese troops had stolen a bucket

278
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:08,320
 from the Bolognese, and it had some stuff in it, it wasn't a completely empty bucket. And then

279
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:15,040
 Bologna responded proportionally by invading with 32,000 troops, and Kale's ensued. So there you go.

280
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,760
 Anyway, I know we're all just thinking about our favourite bits from that war.

281
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,880
 I was just thinking of my favourite Pallini sauce, it's the ice of the years, I'm really sorry.

282
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,120
 Lovely. And they are.

283
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,000
 There was one in Soho, a nice Italian, one of the individual meals. I think you meant recipes,

284
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,320
 okay. Yeah, you do get spaghetti Modenaes, do you? No, you don't. If you do, podcast@QI.com, if that's

285
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,400
 I imagine that was what the outcome of this war was, wasn't it? Who's allowed to make?

286
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,600
 Who gets to do? To get to see with the regu on it. Yeah, go on, Dan, let's have one last one.

287
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,960
 One last one here, and this is a James Harkin fact, but it now is under the custodianship

288
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,520
 of Sean Wandersey, and that fact is there was a group of chimpanzees in Zambia who were a blade of

289
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,480
 grass in their left ear as a fashion statement. Yeah, I bet not anymore, unless it's come back.

290
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:13,440
 Yeah, I wonder how quick fashion changes in the chimpanzee world. I'm not sure. I think this was

291
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,160
 back in the news this year, wasn't it? Yeah, it was, but I've just googled it. This is what it was.

292
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,120
 The headline now is chimpanzees have found a fresh spin on the old fashion,

293
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:33,920
 and they're sticking grass and sticks in their bottoms. Imagine being the first chimpanzee to do that,

294
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,080
 I think, and you know what? Everyone's going to copy me. This is cool. It's the same place,

295
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,840
 it's the same refuge, and it's 15 years later, and it's happened again, but they're also just doing

296
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,320
 it in a different, and they're still doing it in their ears, but they're also doing it into their

297
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,720
 bottoms. Amazing. That's the way fashion goes eventually. Everything comes back around. Get those

298
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,680
 old blades of grass out of the wardrobe where they've been hanging for years. Teenage chimpanzee

299
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:05,840
 going to their parents. Hey, Mum, Dad, I don't suppose you have any blades of grass hanging around

300
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,480
 from your chair. Oh, yes, we do. Oh, that's, oh, I'm so glad it's getting so, wait a minute,

301
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:18,720
 where are you, but what are you doing? Okay, on that note, I think it is time to end today,

302
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:27,280
 show congratulations to Sean, Nikki, Ben, Kara, Rita, Tiffany, Catherine, and Richard. You are

303
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,040
 friends of the podcast, and you are also now custodians of those facts. If you too would like to

304
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,400
 become a custodian of the fact, then go to patreon.com/noseofthingsafish, and you'll be able to find out

305
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,600
 details there of how to become a friend of the podcast or any of the other tears that we do.

306
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,840
 If you don't want to do that, and just want to listen to the show, then come back next week, or come

307
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:54,080
 back on Friday when we will have our big fish episode in the meantime. Bye for me. Oh, also me,

308
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:06,640
 I'm going to say bye. Andy, and there's goodbye from me. Good bye.

309
