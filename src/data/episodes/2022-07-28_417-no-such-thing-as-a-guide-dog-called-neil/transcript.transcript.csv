00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:17,00:00:21,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week"
00:00:21,00:00:24,coming to you live from Belfast.
00:00:24,00:00:27,(audience cheering)
00:00:27,00:00:30,(audience cheering)
00:00:30,00:00:34,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:34,00:00:36,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:36,00:00:38,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:38,00:00:41,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:41,00:00:44,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:44,00:00:47,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:47,00:00:51,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:51,00:00:54,"- Okay, my fact this week is that during the festival"
00:00:54,00:00:58,"of Britain in London in 1951,"
00:00:58,00:01:01,children would deliberately go missing
00:01:01,00:01:02,"because the local police station,"
00:01:02,00:01:04,"where they waited for their parents,"
00:01:04,00:01:07,had the capital's best collection of comic books.
00:01:07,00:01:09,(audience laughing)
00:01:09,00:01:10,- That's incredible.
00:01:10,00:01:12,- This was a huge big deal.
00:01:12,00:01:15,"1951, this is the festival of Britain,"
00:01:15,00:01:18,probably the last massive festival we had in the UK
00:01:18,00:01:21,before the Millennium Dome was built.
00:01:21,00:01:22,And this.
00:01:22,00:01:23,- Don't laugh at the--
00:01:23,00:01:25,(audience laughing)
00:01:25,00:01:27,- It was a huge success in some measures.
00:01:27,00:01:29,(audience laughing)
00:01:29,00:01:30,- Number of domes.
00:01:30,00:01:32,"- Yeah, huge."
00:01:32,00:01:33,"- But yeah, the festival of Britain,"
00:01:33,00:01:34,there was an amazing thing.
00:01:34,00:01:37,They had all these incredible buildings and structures
00:01:37,00:01:40,"and exhibitions all over the UK and London,"
00:01:40,00:01:43,"and Edinburgh, and the Belfast, in fact."
00:01:43,00:01:45,They did have quite a lot here.
00:01:45,00:01:47,"But then it was in 1951, and by 1952,"
00:01:47,00:01:50,the entire thing had been demolished.
00:01:50,00:01:51,There was no TV really in those days.
00:01:51,00:01:53,It was really the early days of TV.
00:01:53,00:01:55,"And so these days, I think it's quite forgotten"
00:01:55,00:01:57,the festival of Britain.
00:01:57,00:01:59,"But when you look into it, it was absolutely amazing."
00:01:59,00:02:01,"- And what's extraordinary about it as well,"
00:02:01,00:02:03,so it was the South Bank in London
00:02:03,00:02:05,"where the Royal Festival Hall is now,"
00:02:05,00:02:07,which is a very iconic venue.
00:02:07,00:02:09,"And I've been there many, many times."
00:02:09,00:02:11,Didn't realize it was built for the festival of Britain.
00:02:11,00:02:12,It was part of the big structure.
00:02:12,00:02:15,So the whole of this South Bank right along the Thames
00:02:15,00:02:18,was just turned into this place of the future.
00:02:18,00:02:20,"And when you see pictures of it,"
00:02:20,00:02:22,it is extraordinary what was there.
00:02:22,00:02:23,- It is.
00:02:23,00:02:26,And it was built basically to cheer people up a bit
00:02:26,00:02:30,"after a little war-type episode, wasn't it?"
00:02:30,00:02:31,- A little run-in with the Germans.
00:02:31,00:02:33,- A little small run-in.
00:02:33,00:02:35,And it seems like it worked.
00:02:35,00:02:36,It seemed to be pretty successful.
00:02:36,00:02:38,"So they had, my favorite piece of the festival of Britain"
00:02:38,00:02:41,"was the, like one of the centerpieces"
00:02:41,00:02:43,"was the Guinness Festival Clock,"
00:02:43,00:02:47,"which was, it was in Battersea Park."
00:02:47,00:02:49,It was 25 feet high.
00:02:49,00:02:51,It said it was the most complicated clock mechanism
00:02:51,00:02:53,for 300 years.
00:02:53,00:02:56,"Which, what happened to clocks 300 years earlier?"
00:02:56,00:02:57,"Where they just, they just forgot"
00:02:57,00:02:59,how to make them properly.
00:02:59,00:03:00,But it was amazing.
00:03:00,00:03:01,What I quite like about the Guinness Festival Clock
00:03:01,00:03:04,"is nowhere, is it explained why this,"
00:03:04,00:03:06,one of these centerpieces of the Great Exhibition
00:03:06,00:03:08,"was something that is made by an Irish company,"
00:03:08,00:03:10,"which, I don't know if you know this, Belfast,"
00:03:10,00:03:13,was not part of the United Kingdom at that time.
00:03:13,00:03:16,"And, nor is it now."
00:03:16,00:03:19,And by two Polish designers.
00:03:19,00:03:20,"And it's never mentioned,"
00:03:20,00:03:22,but it sounds incredible.
00:03:22,00:03:24,So they had the whole Guinness menagerie.
00:03:24,00:03:25,"So, you know, back in the olden days,"
00:03:25,00:03:27,Guinness was advertised by all these animals.
00:03:27,00:03:29,"Like, there was a toucan, wasn't there?"
00:03:29,00:03:31,"Toucan is the big one, the main event, yeah."
00:03:31,00:03:32,They had a crocodile.
00:03:32,00:03:35,"They had a pelican, a bear, a lion, a kinkajou."
00:03:35,00:03:38,"All these typically British, classic kinkajou."
00:03:38,00:03:39,"Kinkajou, you know."
00:03:39,00:03:41,You see them wandering up the South Bank sometimes.
00:03:41,00:03:43,"It's a real British, some kind of South American."
00:03:43,00:03:44,Do you mean pikachu?
00:03:44,00:03:47,"Yes, they had pikachu."
00:03:47,00:03:49,"It's like a weird looking mammal,"
00:03:49,00:03:50,a cute South American mammal.
00:03:50,00:03:53,"Yeah, what kind, what kind of mammal?"
00:03:53,00:03:54,Like a bird or a...
00:03:54,00:03:56,"No, like a bird."
00:03:56,00:03:58,"Sorry, back, wait."
00:03:58,00:03:59,"Hang on. No, no, no, no, no."
00:03:59,00:04:01,"You can't pull that back, then."
00:04:01,00:04:02,"So Anna, what kind of mammal?"
00:04:02,00:04:06,Like a lizard or like a fish or a...
00:04:06,00:04:09,"It was an insect, but..."
00:04:09,00:04:11,What kind of mammal are you talking about?
00:04:11,00:04:13,"Oh, fucking, 'cause he made that joke."
00:04:13,00:04:15,"It's gonna stay at the show now, isn't it?"
00:04:15,00:04:17,That was always gonna stay at the show
00:04:17,00:04:19,"the moment that left your mouth, I'm afraid."
00:04:19,00:04:22,"I suspect it's not the last you're gonna hear of that, fuck off."
00:04:22,00:04:29,"Well, OK, so now we all know birds aren't mammals, great."
00:04:29,00:04:32,You'll welcome everyone else at home who had to have me
00:04:32,00:04:35,take the bullet to get that bit of information out there.
00:04:35,00:04:36,We've all learned something today.
00:04:36,00:04:38,OK. But are they all danced around?
00:04:38,00:04:40,"So what was it, though? Like, did we find out?"
00:04:40,00:04:41,Was it like a spider or was it...
00:04:41,00:04:42,It looks a bit like a sloth.
00:04:42,00:04:45,It's a little... It looks a bit like a sloth.
00:04:45,00:04:48,"Like a cute, slothy type."
00:04:48,00:04:50,"Like a possum or something. OK, looks a bit like that."
00:04:50,00:04:52,Great. The furry thing.
00:04:52,00:04:55,"Anyway, they jumped out of this clock and danced around constantly,"
00:04:55,00:04:58,"and the ostrich would come out, which had beer, glass, ice."
00:04:58,00:04:59,Not a marble.
00:04:59,00:05:02,"Part of the bird family, I believe, is it?"
00:05:02,00:05:03,Very strong. Cool.
00:05:03,00:05:06,"Yeah, it was very cool."
00:05:06,00:05:08,"On the other... I mean, there was so much stuff in London,"
00:05:08,00:05:12,but it was genuinely all across the country.
00:05:12,00:05:14,So 18 million people across the UK
00:05:14,00:05:16,went to one or other of the events that were local.
00:05:16,00:05:20,"The Festival of Britain had its own ship, which is pretty cool."
00:05:20,00:05:22,"Nice. It was called Campania,"
00:05:22,00:05:24,"and the ship had an amazing life, OK?"
00:05:24,00:05:27,It was truly a very versatile ship.
00:05:27,00:05:29,"It was built, actually, it was built in Belfast, local ship."
00:05:29,00:05:31,"It was built, yeah."
00:05:31,00:05:34,"I certainly trust any ship that's been built in Belfast, by the way."
00:05:34,00:05:37,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:37,00:05:41,"Too soon, I think, too soon."
00:05:41,00:05:43,Just a strong history.
00:05:43,00:05:45,"Yeah. Anyway, it was built in Belfast,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,"but then the Second World War,"
00:05:47,00:05:50,"it was requisitioned by the military, by the navy,"
00:05:50,00:05:53,"used as an export carrier, OK, so it's now fine, it's a military ship,"
00:05:53,00:05:55,"saw some action in the Second World War,"
00:05:55,00:05:59,"then it was turned into the showboat for the Festival of Britain in 1951,"
00:05:59,00:06:03,"then it was refitted as the command ship for Operation Hurricane,"
00:06:03,00:06:06,which was the test of the first ever British atomic bomb.
00:06:06,00:06:08,"OK, so it sailed to Australia,"
00:06:08,00:06:10,"and it had some laboratories fitted,"
00:06:10,00:06:12,"and it did the test, it was the, you know, main ship for that."
00:06:12,00:06:14,"And then it was scrapped, so I thought, you know,"
00:06:14,00:06:17,"what an interesting life for a ship, guys."
00:06:17,00:06:21,"Yeah, I feel like this microphone might not be, no, great story."
00:06:21,00:06:25,The Northern Ireland part of the exhibition
00:06:25,00:06:29,"was run by a guy with a brilliant name, he was called Willie De Mayo."
00:06:29,00:06:30,Isn't that cool? Willie De Mayo.
00:06:30,00:06:34,And the whole part of the whole point of the bit around Northern Ireland
00:06:34,00:06:37,"was to show the importance of hard work,"
00:06:37,00:06:39,because Northern Ireland had made a really...
00:06:39,00:06:44,"Because someone in the UK had to work hard, and it was down to you guys."
00:06:44,00:06:49,They worked out that Northern Ireland had made a much bigger part
00:06:49,00:06:52,of the recovery after the war than anywhere else in the UK.
00:06:52,00:06:55,"But they also had a lot of manufacturing on site,"
00:06:55,00:06:57,because they wanted to show how many things were made here.
00:06:57,00:07:00,So they had... You could buy some festival cigarettes.
00:07:00,00:07:03,"Cool. They were made while you watched, they made a cigarette,"
00:07:03,00:07:05,and then you could smoke them. Nice.
00:07:05,00:07:08,"They had some stuff about stockings, nylon stockings,"
00:07:08,00:07:13,and the way they showed those off is they had a load of sort of dismembered legs.
00:07:13,00:07:16,"They weren't real legs, they were like kind of plastic legs,"
00:07:16,00:07:19,"and they were in the shape of a fan, and they all had stockings on them,"
00:07:19,00:07:21,"and they would spin round and round and round,"
00:07:21,00:07:23,and then there would be some nylon that you could kind of see
00:07:23,00:07:25,through the spinning leg fan.
00:07:25,00:07:27,That's cool. Wow. That is cool.
00:07:27,00:07:32,"Back in London, there was all these little other events that were going on,"
00:07:32,00:07:34,"so you would have the main features of the whole festival,"
00:07:34,00:07:38,which would be from theatre through to these caves that were built
00:07:38,00:07:40,that were absolutely stunning.
00:07:40,00:07:43,"They were like grottoes, which looked incredibly beautiful."
00:07:43,00:07:48,And then there was a French-stunt tightrope walker called Eliano.
00:07:48,00:07:50,I think that's the right pronunciation.
00:07:50,00:07:53,"And he walked across the Thames, so they put a tightrope up"
00:07:53,00:07:57,"the whole way through, across the Thames, and he walked it,"
00:07:57,00:08:02,"and near the end, he almost fell, and he went down onto one knee,"
00:08:02,00:08:06,"and he stayed there for four minutes, and then he eventually got up"
00:08:06,00:08:08,"and then made it to the end, and it was a success,"
00:08:08,00:08:13,but it was particularly scary because Eliano didn't know how to swim.
00:08:13,00:08:15,"Oh, no."
00:08:15,00:08:17,"And how do you fall in? That could have been a horrific moment,"
00:08:17,00:08:22,"but, like, yeah, that's pretty bold going across a giant body of water"
00:08:22,00:08:23,when you don't know how to swim.
00:08:23,00:08:25,"Well, people appreciated it."
00:08:25,00:08:28,"You can watch the footage of that, and 100,000 people were there,"
00:08:28,00:08:30,and that's a lot of people.
00:08:30,00:08:33,It's like the entirety of London seemed to be rammed.
00:08:33,00:08:36,"I guess it was when you only had two channels on TV, so nothing else to do."
00:08:36,00:08:38,I don't have no TV to watch them on.
00:08:38,00:08:41,"And when are we with 51, mostly when I'm on TV?"
00:08:41,00:08:45,"Well, there was a big theatre there where people went to see television"
00:08:45,00:08:48,"for the first time, the first time seeing visuals, yeah."
00:08:48,00:08:50,Have you seen just with the Eliano tightrope?
00:08:50,00:08:53,Have you seen what he does when he falls onto his knee?
00:08:53,00:08:56,"No. He mouths, well, according to one newspaper writer,"
00:08:56,00:08:59,"he's obviously doing something, and I don't know how the journalist could see this,"
00:08:59,00:09:02,"but he mouths to his wife, who was in the audience,"
00:09:02,00:09:04,who was also a tightrope walker.
00:09:04,00:09:07,"I can't do this, the rope's too slack, I'm going to fall."
00:09:07,00:09:10,"You know, somebody help me, and she just shouted back,"
00:09:10,00:09:13,"""You've got to do it, you've got no choice, come on, get up, mate."""
00:09:13,00:09:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:15,00:09:16,Wow.
00:09:16,00:09:18,And that kind of tough love is what does it?
00:09:18,00:09:20,"Yeah, yeah, that's so good."
00:09:20,00:09:23,Have you heard of the role of Laurie Lee?
00:09:23,00:09:26,"Laurie Lee is author of ""Sider with Rosie."""
00:09:26,00:09:27,"And, go on."
00:09:27,00:09:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:28,00:09:30,What's the second famous book that Laurie Lee wrote?
00:09:30,00:09:32,"""The Old Biography of Laurie Lee."""
00:09:32,00:09:33,"Yeah, exactly."
00:09:33,00:09:36,"Well, it was a memoir, so that kind of was the autobiography."
00:09:36,00:09:38,"Anyway, look at the point."
00:09:38,00:09:39,"I was trying to help you out, though."
00:09:39,00:09:42,"I'm really sorry, I wasn't biting the hand."
00:09:42,00:09:45,"Anyway, he was appointed the curator of eccentrics,"
00:09:45,00:09:48,because they wanted to have some fun stuff.
00:09:48,00:09:52,"And he said, put an ad in the papers saying, ""Send me stupid ideas,"
00:09:52,00:09:55,"and we'll build them, and we'll put them in the exhibition of eccentric things."""
00:09:55,00:09:57,"And he got brilliant suggestions, okay?"
00:09:57,00:09:59,"And they built a lot of these things, which is really cool."
00:09:59,00:10:03,"So, one that they didn't build is the deflatable rubber bus"
00:10:03,00:10:04,for going under low bridges.
00:10:04,00:10:06,"Ah, brilliant."
00:10:06,00:10:08,Very good.
00:10:08,00:10:10,"A machine which was 20 feet by 20 feet,"
00:10:10,00:10:13,and its sole purpose was to blow out a single match held in front of it.
00:10:13,00:10:15,- Okay. - That's a cool thing.
00:10:15,00:10:18,"I love this one, a staircase which had weighted steps, okay?"
00:10:18,00:10:21,"So, you could give someone the feeling of going upstairs"
00:10:21,00:10:24,while they were actually going downstairs.
00:10:24,00:10:25,- How cool is that? - That's the thing.
00:10:25,00:10:27,"- No, not very cool at all, is it? - How does..."
00:10:27,00:10:30,"- What? - You get in all the worst bit, basically,"
00:10:30,00:10:32,"of going upstairs, and you get in it when you're going downstairs."
00:10:32,00:10:35,"Yeah, but it would be useful..."
00:10:35,00:10:36,When?
00:10:36,00:10:37,Wait!
00:10:37,00:10:39,"It's good exercise, isn't it?"
00:10:39,00:10:41,"Although, if you could do the opposite"
00:10:41,00:10:43,"and give the impression of sliding down a banister,"
00:10:43,00:10:44,and then you end up on the second floor...
00:10:44,00:10:46,"- That would be amazing. - That's the way to do it, yeah."
00:10:46,00:10:48,- If you had to trick someone... - Yep.
00:10:48,00:10:50,...to thinking that they were going upstairs
00:10:50,00:10:52,- when they were actually going downstairs. - Yeah.
00:10:52,00:10:54,- Why would you want to do that? - You're a kidnapper.
00:10:54,00:10:55,And...
00:10:55,00:11:00,"- Okay, I'm a kidnapper. - To only the most obvious, you know."
00:11:00,00:11:03,"And I want them to think that they're in the top of a building,"
00:11:03,00:11:04,- but they're actually in a basement. - Yeah.
00:11:04,00:11:07,"So that later on, when they say, ""Where were you kept?"""
00:11:07,00:11:10,"The kidnap situation has been resolved, it's all fine."
00:11:10,00:11:15,"And they try and escape, but they're just going deeper and deeper and deeper."
00:11:15,00:11:18,"They'll be asked, you know, ""Where were you being kept?"""
00:11:18,00:11:19,"They say, ""Well, I was upstairs."""
00:11:19,00:11:22,And so the police will be looking in places upstairs.
00:11:22,00:11:24,"- Upstairs, you're right. - You're in the cellar the whole time."
00:11:24,00:11:26,And is this how they use this thing?
00:11:26,00:11:27,It wasn't...
00:11:27,00:11:30,Was this one of the main attractions of the Festival of Britain?
00:11:30,00:11:33,"All the kidnappers were running riot because the police were taking care of the kids, weren't they?"
00:11:33,00:11:36,"It's a millennium dome, that stairs, that you could feel like you were walking upstairs"
00:11:36,00:11:38,while you were walking downstairs. It would have been a runaway hit.
00:11:38,00:11:41,You're right.
00:11:41,00:11:44,They also commissioned a lot of artists to do original art as part of this.
00:11:44,00:11:46,So they had famous artists building statues and so on.
00:11:46,00:11:49,"And one of the artists they got was Henry Moore,"
00:11:49,00:11:53,and he did a reclining figure that was his piece.
00:11:53,00:11:57,And there's a story that a small boy caught his head
00:11:57,00:12:01,under one of the legs of the reclining figure and got stuck in there.
00:12:01,00:12:05,"And so the account was that they were pushing and pulling for ages,"
00:12:05,00:12:08,"- trying to get this kid... - Well, pushing and pulling isn't going to work."
00:12:08,00:12:12,"- Oh, from different ends, I suppose. - From different... Yeah, they were just trying to..."
00:12:12,00:12:14,"Not just like for an hour that you are pushing, right?"
00:12:14,00:12:18,"- No, I'm pulling! Oh, shit! - Yeah, I see you."
00:12:18,00:12:21,They shouldn't have got the Chuckle Brothers to do the extrication job.
00:12:21,00:12:25,"Yeah, so what they did was they were just trying desperately to get him out."
00:12:25,00:12:29,"They couldn't get him out, so then they brought huge quantities of soap over it,"
00:12:29,00:12:33,and they started sooping this boy up in order to get him out.
00:12:33,00:12:37,"And they finally managed to... And they tried weird things, like..."
00:12:37,00:12:39,"The soap was on his neck, it was on his body."
00:12:39,00:12:43,They finally pulled him up vertically and managed to pull him out that way.
00:12:43,00:12:46,"Sorry, they put him into a flat horizontal position,"
00:12:46,00:12:47,"and they managed to pull him out that way,"
00:12:47,00:12:52,"and they said it was like a missile from the breach of a gun, like he popped out."
00:12:52,00:12:56,And his mother reported that her son's neck had never been so clean.
00:12:56,00:13:01,These are the kind of japes that were happening at the Festival of Britain.
00:13:01,00:13:06,"There was another sculpture called Root Bodied Forth by someone called Mitzi Konlif,"
00:13:06,00:13:10,and this was a sculpture of two bodies entwined together
00:13:10,00:13:12,as if they're coming out of the earth.
00:13:12,00:13:14,So if you can imagine the bodies going round.
00:13:14,00:13:18,"The person who was in charge of the Festival of Britain was called Sir Gerald Barry,"
00:13:18,00:13:21,"and he had to go and look at this sculpture when it was being made,"
00:13:21,00:13:25,because he'd been tipped off that it might be a study in sodomy.
00:13:25,00:13:30,"And he concluded that if it was a study in sodomy,"
00:13:30,00:13:32,then it was one that was anatomically impossible.
00:13:32,00:13:35,Fair enough.
00:13:35,00:13:38,I can't believe that it takes someone professional to judge it.
00:13:38,00:13:42,It seems like it'd be pretty obvious to most people if there's a study in sodomy or not.
00:13:42,00:13:45,"No, there's expertise in every field, Anna."
00:13:45,00:13:49,You think you're some kind of expert.
00:13:49,00:13:51,I just think we might all be experts in that.
00:13:51,00:13:52,Looking at it.
00:13:52,00:13:56,All doing it.
00:13:56,00:13:59,"I'm not judging, but I'm just saying to look at most of us."
00:13:59,00:14:00,Can we should move on anyway?
00:14:00,00:14:01,"No, no, no."
00:14:01,00:14:03,"I feel like this is your mammal gate, Anna."
00:14:03,00:14:07,"No, it wasn't amazing."
00:14:07,00:14:12,But the craziest thing of all is that they spent something like 12 million pounds on it
00:14:12,00:14:13,at the time in the '50s.
00:14:13,00:14:14,A huge amount of money.
00:14:14,00:14:16,It was funded by the Labour government.
00:14:16,00:14:19,"It was Clement Attlee, who was in power at the time."
00:14:19,00:14:23,"There was a guy, Herbert Morrison, who kind of was seen to be the person who was going to"
00:14:23,00:14:26,"succeed Attlee, never actually did."
00:14:26,00:14:28,"His grandson is Peter Mandelson, I discovered."
00:14:28,00:14:30,So it's like a history of staying in politics.
00:14:30,00:14:34,"But it went up in, when was it?"
00:14:34,00:14:36,It was in- 51.
00:14:36,00:14:38,"Yeah, 51, but it was in May 51, I think it was."
00:14:38,00:14:42,Churchill then didn't like it at all.
00:14:42,00:14:43,So much money went in.
00:14:43,00:14:44,It looked beautiful.
00:14:44,00:14:45,And by September of that year-
00:14:45,00:14:46,He got back into office in that time.
00:14:46,00:14:47,Exactly.
00:14:47,00:14:49,So he got back in in that time.
00:14:49,00:14:52,"And by September, they had it dismantled, this incredible thing."
00:14:52,00:14:57,"Yeah, they saw it as like an emblem of socialism and this great kind of,"
00:14:57,00:14:59,all of these amazing sculptures and buildings.
00:14:59,00:15:01,They were kind of of the socialist government.
00:15:01,00:15:03,"They're like, ""We're having none of that. Let's get rid of it."""
00:15:03,00:15:03,Yeah.
00:15:03,00:15:04,It was jealous.
00:15:04,00:15:07,"This is basically Lego gate from my childhood,"
00:15:07,00:15:10,when my brother managed to make the Lego pirate ship when I had failed
00:15:10,00:15:14,"and I got up in the middle of the night, went into his room and smashed it to pieces."
00:15:14,00:15:16,And that is what this was.
00:15:16,00:15:17,Right.
00:15:18,00:15:20,And at least I'm adult enough to admit that.
00:15:20,00:15:22,I bet Churchill never admitted that was what he was doing.
00:15:22,00:15:23,Have you admitted it to your brother?
00:15:23,00:15:25,Or is he going to hear this podcast?
00:15:25,00:15:27,"Fortunately, he doesn't listen to the show."
00:15:27,00:15:32,"Very interesting, the dismantling of all this stuff."
00:15:32,00:15:34,It was really hard to dismantle because they had to do it quite quickly
00:15:34,00:15:36,and they were losing staff all the time.
00:15:36,00:15:41,"So they had like things like the single largest sheet of glass in the world at that point,"
00:15:41,00:15:43,because it was part of the telescope that they'd built.
00:15:43,00:15:44,"And they didn't know how to,"
00:15:44,00:15:48,they'd had to dismantle everything around it before they could get this sheet out
00:15:48,00:15:49,and they were losing people.
00:15:49,00:15:50,"They had a train from India,"
00:15:50,00:15:54,which they couldn't put on the railway to get back to its ship in time
00:15:54,00:15:55,because it was the wrong gauge.
00:15:55,00:15:58,Like there were all these issues and most things in there were really expensive.
00:15:58,00:16:01,"So you had these security guards who were bouncers,"
00:16:01,00:16:06,basically protecting millions of pounds worth of items and inventions that were there.
00:16:06,00:16:09,"And one of the things that they had a lot of were dust bins,"
00:16:09,00:16:12,all the bins that were around for this place.
00:16:12,00:16:15,And one person went and bought them all up or most of them.
00:16:15,00:16:18,And that was a guy called Billy Butlin who runs Butlins.
00:16:18,00:16:24,"So if you ever went to Butlins in the late 50s and possibly through to now,"
00:16:24,00:16:25,the bins that you're putting your rubbish in
00:16:25,00:16:27,are the bins that were at the Festival of Britain.
00:16:27,00:16:29,"Wait, you think that's still the same bin?"
00:16:29,00:16:31,I didn't find a photo of a recent bin.
00:16:31,00:16:32,"Yeah, it could be."
00:16:32,00:16:35,"I mean, they can't, you know, they don't get much wear and tear bin."
00:16:35,00:16:36,Where are you going to throw them away Anna?
00:16:40,00:16:42,But we need to move on to our next fact.
00:16:42,00:16:45,"It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:16:45,00:16:47,"My fact is that in the 1990s,"
00:16:47,00:16:48,a British bank set up a computer system
00:16:48,00:16:52,so they could write to all their wealthiest customers at once.
00:16:52,00:16:55,"Unfortunately, due to a rogue bit of placeholder text,"
00:16:55,00:16:59,"they started sending out letters which began ""Dear Rich Bastard."""
00:16:59,00:17:08,"So this was in a paper recently and the website Snopes,"
00:17:08,00:17:12,"who do a lot of debunking and bunking have, you checked it out."
00:17:12,00:17:13,And it did happen.
00:17:13,00:17:15,It was written up in computer weekly at the time.
00:17:15,00:17:17,It was a telecommunication firm.
00:17:17,00:17:19,They were launching a new gold card
00:17:19,00:17:21,and they wanted to email the richest people all at once
00:17:21,00:17:23,and see if they wanted to buy a new product.
00:17:23,00:17:26,And so one of the programmers just wrote a bit of placeholder text.
00:17:26,00:17:28,"Normally, the name of the customer would be in there,"
00:17:28,00:17:32,but some of the records were a bit botched and couldn't read it.
00:17:32,00:17:34,"So he just said as a little joke to himself,"
00:17:34,00:17:36,"this will never go out, but it's going to be ""Dear Rich Bastard."""
00:17:36,00:17:37,"Anyway, he then left the project."
00:17:38,00:17:41,And it was handed on to a different programmer
00:17:41,00:17:42,who didn't know about this.
00:17:42,00:17:44,And it was restarted.
00:17:44,00:17:48,And so they started later sending out these letters
00:17:48,00:17:49,"to ""Dear Rich Bastard."""
00:17:49,00:17:51,"Allegedly, they got one complaint from a customer"
00:17:51,00:17:53,"who hadn't been called ""Dear Rich Bastard"""
00:17:53,00:17:54,and was very offended.
00:17:54,00:17:56,"""Dear Rich Bastard."""
00:17:56,00:17:57,"Yeah, exactly."
00:17:57,00:17:58,It could have been sent to...
00:17:58,00:18:04,There was a British Royal Naval officer in 1798 called Richard Bastard.
00:18:04,00:18:05,No.
00:18:05,00:18:06,"Could have gone to him, Rich Bastard."
00:18:06,00:18:10,There was also a Rich Bastard who was born in 1788 in Cornwall.
00:18:10,00:18:14,"He changed his name, actually, to Richard Bastion."
00:18:14,00:18:15,And it seems to be...
00:18:15,00:18:17,It changed it just when he got married.
00:18:17,00:18:19,He got married to a woman called Jennifer Sincock.
00:18:19,00:18:23,And they became the Bastions.
00:18:23,00:18:25,And the other Rich Bastard...
00:18:25,00:18:27,"The only other Rich Bastard I could find,"
00:18:27,00:18:30,"a real Rich Bastard, is friend of the podcast, Seaguar Bastard."
00:18:30,00:18:31,Do you remember him?
00:18:31,00:18:32,"Yeah, what did he do?"
00:18:32,00:18:33,He was a football referee.
00:18:33,00:18:34,"Oh, yeah."
00:18:34,00:18:35,Seaguar Bastard.
00:18:35,00:18:39,"And his middle name was Richard, so he was Seaguar Rich Bastard."
00:18:39,00:18:43,"And on his Wikipedia, there's a full paragraph on..."
00:18:43,00:18:46,"It says there is a popular belief that because of his name,"
00:18:46,00:18:49,"Bastard was the inspiration behind the chant,"
00:18:49,00:18:50,"""Who's the Bastard in the Black?"""
00:18:50,00:18:55,And Wikipedia says it's unlikely that he was the inspiration
00:18:55,00:18:58,because the colour of the clothing he wore
00:18:58,00:18:59,while refereeing is not documented.
00:19:01,00:19:04,And football chants did not include verbal aggression
00:19:04,00:19:07,towards officials until at least the 1960s.
00:19:07,00:19:11,"Long after he had died, so..."
00:19:11,00:19:12,"Thanks, Wikipedia."
00:19:12,00:19:13,Just bustin' a myth there.
00:19:13,00:19:17,I love these big mail-outs where something goes wrong.
00:19:17,00:19:20,I remember reading a story about a guy in Canada.
00:19:20,00:19:23,He went on this date and it was a really good date.
00:19:23,00:19:24,"And at the end of the date,"
00:19:24,00:19:26,"he got given the number of this girl, Nicole,"
00:19:26,00:19:29,"who liked, you know, possibly wanted to meet up again."
00:19:29,00:19:32,"So he gets home and the next day, he calls her,"
00:19:32,00:19:35,"or, you know, in the next few days, calls her."
00:19:35,00:19:36,And it's the wrong number.
00:19:36,00:19:39,"So he's like, ""Shit, she's given me the wrong number"
00:19:39,00:19:41,"by possibly one digit, I don't know."""
00:19:41,00:19:45,"But how do you find Nicole, you know, in the campus"
00:19:45,00:19:47,"where he was, which was the University of Calgary?"
00:19:47,00:19:52,So what he did was he tracked down all 200 Nicole's email addresses
00:19:52,00:19:55,"and he sent out a group email to all the Nicole's,"
00:19:55,00:19:57,"sort of individually, saying,"
00:19:57,00:19:59,"""Are you the Nicole who gave me a number?"""
00:19:59,00:20:02,"I'm getting a few red flags here, I don't know about anyone else."
00:20:02,00:20:06,But what's amazing is the story became a bit big.
00:20:06,00:20:10,A Facebook page was set up between all of the Nicole's
00:20:10,00:20:11,and they started becoming buddies.
00:20:11,00:20:14,"So all these new Nicole's were like a big Nicole clan,"
00:20:14,00:20:16,"all of a sudden, and they managed to find the one"
00:20:16,00:20:19,who he was looking for and she did give the wrong number
00:20:19,00:20:20,and she did want to meet up with him again.
00:20:20,00:20:21,Oh!
00:20:21,00:20:22,"So, yeah, yeah, so it wasn't like he was being..."
00:20:22,00:20:23,She's now dead.
00:20:23,00:20:27,Wow.
00:20:27,00:20:28,Pretty amazing.
00:20:28,00:20:29,"That is, yeah."
00:20:29,00:20:31,It's maybe a nice story.
00:20:31,00:20:33,It's really on the edge between creepy and romantic.
00:20:33,00:20:34,"It's so close, isn't it?"
00:20:34,00:20:35,It's romantic.
00:20:35,00:20:39,They're just on these sort of mass mailing things.
00:20:39,00:20:41,I really like the errors that companies make
00:20:41,00:20:43,because it happens a lot.
00:20:43,00:20:45,"So there was a time in 2016,"
00:20:45,00:20:46,"maybe someone in the room got one of these messages,"
00:20:46,00:20:47,I don't know.
00:20:47,00:20:49,One person accidentally sent a test email
00:20:49,00:20:52,"to 840,000 people in the NHS."
00:20:52,00:20:52,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:52,00:20:55,They accidentally did a write to everybody.
00:20:55,00:20:57,One working-age person in 40 in the country
00:20:57,00:20:58,got an email.
00:20:58,00:20:59,That was a flub
00:20:59,00:21:01,"and it was obviously a big waste of, you know,"
00:21:01,00:21:02,gummed up the computers.
00:21:02,00:21:06,"Unfortunately, they were all CC'd in, not BCC'd."
00:21:06,00:21:08,"So almost immediately someone wrote saying,"
00:21:08,00:21:11,"""Reply all, please take me off this mailing list."""
00:21:11,00:21:15,"So another 840,000 messages went out"
00:21:15,00:21:17,and then obviously the funny people started kicking in.
00:21:17,00:21:21,"In a single hour and a quarter, 500 million emails were sent."
00:21:21,00:21:22,Wow.
00:21:22,00:21:25,The NHS had basically launched a crippling attack
00:21:25,00:21:26,on its own computers.
00:21:27,00:21:30,Didn't they actually...
00:21:30,00:21:32,Didn't it shut down for a while?
00:21:32,00:21:33,I seem to remember that.
00:21:33,00:21:35,"It was so overloaded, didn't it?"
00:21:35,00:21:35,Yeah.
00:21:35,00:21:37,"I understand that's the Tory party is saying,"
00:21:37,00:21:39,"the fewer NHS staff we have,"
00:21:39,00:21:41,the less likely this will happen again.
00:21:41,00:21:43,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:21:43,00:21:46,The HBO sent a test.
00:21:46,00:21:48,I sent an email around exactly like this
00:21:48,00:21:49,to everyone that they shouldn't have done.
00:21:49,00:21:50,"It was everyone on the mailing list,"
00:21:50,00:21:52,got this kind of test email.
00:21:52,00:21:55,And someone wrote on Twitter that it happened
00:21:55,00:21:58,and then everyone on Twitter decided to share their stories
00:21:58,00:22:00,of when they fucked up at work.
00:22:00,00:22:00,Some of them were really good.
00:22:00,00:22:03,There was someone called @AaronChevyFord
00:22:03,00:22:06,and they said that they'd made a PDF
00:22:06,00:22:09,assigning each employee to the Muppet
00:22:09,00:22:10,they reminded them of the most.
00:22:10,00:22:16,"They said, ""I meant to send it to my work friend,"
00:22:16,00:22:19,but I accidentally sent it to the entire company.
00:22:19,00:22:22,"My supervisor, Beaker."""
00:22:25,00:22:29,"""Wanted to fire me, but the owners, Bert and Ernie, intervened."""
00:22:29,00:22:30,So good!
00:22:30,00:22:32,"It was amazing, isn't it?"
00:22:32,00:22:36,"And then there was one person called Casey,"
00:22:36,00:22:37,"him who also replied and they said,"
00:22:37,00:22:39,"""I was using my desktop calendar"
00:22:39,00:22:42,"to make a note of when I started my period,"
00:22:42,00:22:45,"but after several months realized I was doing it on a calendar,"
00:22:45,00:22:47,"I shared with the entire company."""
00:22:47,00:22:54,"It's useful information, some would argue."
00:22:54,00:22:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:56,00:22:58,"It's just, yeah."
00:22:58,00:23:00,I like always imagining the behind the scenes
00:23:00,00:23:02,"when these stories come out,"
00:23:02,00:23:04,because companies will do this
00:23:04,00:23:07,"and then send out an apology saying, ""Websi daisies."""
00:23:07,00:23:08,And then I just imagine the person
00:23:08,00:23:10,getting furiously fired in the background.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"And there was one in 2018,"
00:23:12,00:23:14,it was the US Embassy in Australia
00:23:14,00:23:16,sent out an email invitation
00:23:16,00:23:20,"to just all the big shot diplomats, politicians, journalists,"
00:23:20,00:23:24,"and the invitation simply had a cat wearing pajamas,"
00:23:24,00:23:27,"holding a box of cookies with the words ""Cat pajama jam."""
00:23:27,00:23:29,"And it went out to, you know,"
00:23:29,00:23:31,people at the highest levels of government.
00:23:31,00:23:33,"And so the Embassy sent a tweet out saying,"
00:23:33,00:23:36,"""Sorry if you were looking forward to the pajama party,"
00:23:36,00:23:38,"don't worry, I'm afraid it's not going to happen."""
00:23:38,00:23:42,It was a training error made by one of our new staff
00:23:42,00:23:43,and then they followed it up
00:23:43,00:23:46,by saying that new controls will now be implemented
00:23:46,00:23:48,so something similar doesn't happen again.
00:23:48,00:23:50,"And you just know that that member of new staff,"
00:23:50,00:23:53,that one little intern has made this mistake
00:23:53,00:23:56,"and the new controls are that intern,"
00:23:56,00:23:57,not being an intern anymore.
00:23:57,00:24:00,"We're going to have to move on, guys."
00:24:00,00:24:04,"Oh, can I tell you a thing about autofill text,"
00:24:04,00:24:05,which is kind of what the original fact is about?
00:24:05,00:24:08,So there's a fake text generator.
00:24:08,00:24:10,"The fake Latin is called loram ipsum, you know,"
00:24:10,00:24:12,"when you just get, it just looks like a Latin sentence."
00:24:12,00:24:15,"It's not really, it's just an old chopped up Latin text,"
00:24:15,00:24:17,"basically, which looks like it sentences, but it's not."
00:24:17,00:24:20,"Anyway, that's been established for hundreds of years,"
00:24:20,00:24:23,but there are new loram ipsums all the time
00:24:23,00:24:24,and it's really exciting.
00:24:24,00:24:25,There is office ipsum.
00:24:25,00:24:27,You can get a Samuel L. Jackson ipsum.
00:24:27,00:24:32,"And there's also, I really like an online dating profile,"
00:24:32,00:24:34,"loram ipsum, basically, a text generator,"
00:24:34,00:24:36,which just generates a dating profile.
00:24:36,00:24:38,So I just wondered if you fancied hearing a bit of it.
00:24:38,00:24:38,"Yes, please."
00:24:38,00:24:41,"Okay, if you plug it in, it just gives you this."
00:24:41,00:24:45,"Mountain biking, vampire weekend, exploring the city, Ethiopian."
00:24:45,00:24:47,"Down to earth, snowboarding, new friends, running shoes."
00:24:47,00:24:49,"If you think we have something in common,"
00:24:49,00:24:51,"I'm pretty laid back, sleeping late."
00:24:51,00:24:53,"Kurosawa, I have a crush on."
00:24:53,00:24:55,"If you're still reading this,"
00:24:55,00:24:56,my favorite word is sushi.
00:24:56,00:24:59,Passionate about making lasagna from scratch going to the gym.
00:24:59,00:25:03,"Guys, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:25:03,00:25:07,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:25:07,00:25:11,"My fact this week is that when leaving the Norwegian military,"
00:25:11,00:25:15,soldiers must now hand over their used underpants and socks
00:25:15,00:25:16,for the next recruit to wear.
00:25:17,00:25:22,"Yeah, this is breaking news."
00:25:22,00:25:26,"It depends how you do it, doesn't it?"
00:25:26,00:25:28,It depends how you requisition those back.
00:25:28,00:25:30,"It's not like I'm going to need your gun, your badge,"
00:25:30,00:25:31,and your pants right now.
00:25:31,00:25:35,"Well, it used to be that you would give every other bit of clothing back."
00:25:35,00:25:36,"Oh, but you got to keep the pants."
00:25:36,00:25:37,"Yeah, you kept your pants and socks."
00:25:37,00:25:38,I was sitting there.
00:25:38,00:25:40,"Yeah, but then, you know, it's been a hard time in the pandemic."
00:25:40,00:25:44,"So the Norwegian defense logistics organization, Spokespeople,"
00:25:44,00:25:46,"said that with proper checks and cleaning,"
00:25:46,00:25:50,the reuse of garments is considered an adequate and sound practice.
00:25:50,00:25:52,And so that's what it is now.
00:25:52,00:25:53,You've got to hand back your pants.
00:25:53,00:25:56,"And I think it's fair because you hear used pants,"
00:25:56,00:25:58,and what you've heard is unwashed pants.
00:25:58,00:25:59,And that's not what they do.
00:25:59,00:26:01,"They do wash them first, right?"
00:26:01,00:26:03,"And do they also make them keep,"
00:26:03,00:26:04,"you know, in a shop when you try on pants,"
00:26:04,00:26:07,you have to keep that plastic thing in the crotch bit.
00:26:07,00:26:09,"They make them wear that the whole time as well, don't they?"
00:26:09,00:26:10,What's that bit?
00:26:10,00:26:14,I'm not aware of this.
00:26:14,00:26:16,"You know, when you go up and do a bit of stand-up,"
00:26:16,00:26:18,"and you're like, everyone will know what I'm talking about here."
00:26:18,00:26:19,Hang on.
00:26:19,00:26:20,What's plastic?
00:26:20,00:26:22,I don't try on pants much in the shop.
00:26:22,00:26:25,Maybe you're not supposed to.
00:26:25,00:26:26,You know what?
00:26:26,00:26:26,It's when you're trying on.
00:26:26,00:26:27,"Actually, do you know what?"
00:26:27,00:26:29,It's when you're trying on the bikini bottoms.
00:26:29,00:26:30,Right.
00:26:30,00:26:31,"So does anyone know what I mean, the sticky bit?"
00:26:31,00:26:35,That sounded like a lot of female voices.
00:26:35,00:26:38,So distinctly female voices there.
00:26:38,00:26:39,Yeah.
00:26:39,00:26:41,"Anyway, the plastic sticky thing."
00:26:41,00:26:42,It's really useful if you don't want to get stuff dirty.
00:26:42,00:26:45,Just cover it in plastic sticky stuff.
00:26:45,00:26:46,And then you don't even need to use deodorant.
00:26:46,00:26:47,"Wait, so you wear--"
00:26:47,00:26:48,Wait.
00:26:48,00:26:48,You wear--
00:26:48,00:26:52,Have you laminated your pants?
00:26:52,00:26:52,Yeah.
00:26:52,00:26:52,That's what I'm--
00:26:52,00:26:56,Everything I'm wearing is laminated right now.
00:26:56,00:26:59,I feel like we're all learning so much about each other
00:26:59,00:27:00,"tonight, specifically."
00:27:00,00:27:04,It's really-- this happens a lot in armed forces.
00:27:04,00:27:06,There are lots of stories about what
00:27:06,00:27:07,happens with their pants policy.
00:27:07,00:27:13,"So for example, the Swiss army of knife fame, they only--"
00:27:13,00:27:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:17,00:27:19,They only allow their female recruits
00:27:19,00:27:22,"to wear women's pants in 2021, which"
00:27:22,00:27:25,is very recent for that shift of policy to have been made.
00:27:25,00:27:28,"Until then, women were just issued with standard underwear,"
00:27:28,00:27:29,which was men's pants.
00:27:29,00:27:31,I think they wouldn't have been stopped.
00:27:31,00:27:33,They weren't checking whether they were wearing women's underwear.
00:27:33,00:27:35,It was just they weren't given women's underwear
00:27:35,00:27:37,as part of their uniform.
00:27:37,00:27:37,"Yes, that's true."
00:27:37,00:27:39,"But still, that's a--"
00:27:39,00:27:41,"You know, they're not being made to feel welcome"
00:27:41,00:27:41,with this kind of stuff.
00:27:41,00:27:44,"So anyway, they've launched a trial this year where women"
00:27:44,00:27:46,actually now get women's pants.
00:27:46,00:27:47,And they're convinced this is going
00:27:47,00:27:48,to be a big draw for recruitment.
00:27:48,00:27:49,I'm not.
00:27:49,00:27:51,"Hey, or a small draw."
00:27:51,00:27:52,"It depends on your size, right?"
00:27:52,00:27:54,"Is there a lot of chat between the women going,"
00:27:54,00:27:57,what's this plastic thing that's on the inside?
00:27:57,00:28:00,"But at the moment, it's only 1% of the Swiss army is women."
00:28:00,00:28:04,"And they're hoping by 2030, it will be 10% just due to this pants"
00:28:04,00:28:05,thing.
00:28:05,00:28:05,Really?
00:28:05,00:28:06,"Yeah, maybe not."
00:28:06,00:28:08,They told more of the women about the corkscrew on the knives.
00:28:08,00:28:11,"I'm telling you, they get a lot more recruits."
00:28:11,00:28:13,What do you guys think that commandos
00:28:13,00:28:15,wear underneath their trousers?
00:28:15,00:28:19,I'm going to press the button and say nothing at all.
00:28:19,00:28:22,"No, that is the QI Klaxon."
00:28:22,00:28:25,"They wear nappies, basically."
00:28:25,00:28:28,Nappies known as blast pelvic protectors.
00:28:28,00:28:29,OK.
00:28:29,00:28:30,"Well, it's a scary job, isn't it?"
00:28:30,00:28:35,Which direction is the blast coming from?
00:28:35,00:28:38,"It's to stop external blasts from coming in,"
00:28:38,00:28:41,rather than the internal blast going out.
00:28:41,00:28:44,"But it's because, basically, if there's an explosion"
00:28:44,00:28:46,"or a mine or something like that,"
00:28:46,00:28:48,you might get some shrapnel.
00:28:48,00:28:50,"And you have a lot of very important arteries,"
00:28:50,00:28:52,apart from everything else that's down there.
00:28:52,00:28:54,"If you get a bit of shrapnel in your upper thigh,"
00:28:54,00:28:55,then you're done for.
00:28:55,00:28:59,And so they all have these what they call nappy protectors.
00:28:59,00:29:00,And they put those things up.
00:29:00,00:29:03,"We're not sure why going commando comes from,"
00:29:03,00:29:04,where it comes from.
00:29:04,00:29:06,"According to the OED, it probably"
00:29:06,00:29:09,is just because commando is a really brave and hardcore.
00:29:09,00:29:13,"And it was like American school slang, college slang."
00:29:13,00:29:15,"And they're like, well, if you don't wear pants,"
00:29:15,00:29:17,you're as hardcore as a commando.
00:29:17,00:29:19,But then there is some interviews with commando.
00:29:19,00:29:24,"So there's an interview with Lee West, who is a commando."
00:29:24,00:29:27,"And he said that they would take off their pants,"
00:29:27,00:29:28,"because if they didn't,"
00:29:28,00:29:31,then there would be bacteria cultivated
00:29:31,00:29:33,and their balls might drop off.
00:29:33,00:29:34,What?
00:29:34,00:29:36,That's what he said.
00:29:36,00:29:40,He also said sometimes they might go into an area
00:29:40,00:29:43,and then they would leave a pair of soiled pants
00:29:43,00:29:45,to taunt the enemy.
00:29:45,00:29:46,"And so when they came away,"
00:29:46,00:29:48,they wouldn't be wearing any pants underneath.
00:29:48,00:29:50,"Rat boys, what's this?"
00:29:50,00:29:50,Yeah.
00:29:50,00:29:52,It's the most serious.
00:29:52,00:29:53,"Hey, great news."
00:29:53,00:29:54,We've got Osama Bin Laden.
00:29:54,00:29:55,Right.
00:29:55,00:29:57,"You, Private Smith, get your pants off."
00:29:57,00:29:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:57,00:29:58,What's the--
00:29:58,00:30:00,Why did they think that--
00:30:00,00:30:02,why would being commando make your balls
00:30:02,00:30:04,any more likely to drop off in pants than anyone else?
00:30:04,00:30:07,Jungle territory is the thing.
00:30:07,00:30:09,Possibly would have started around the Korean War
00:30:09,00:30:11,"or the Vietnam War, perhaps."
00:30:11,00:30:13,It does-- the British Army do have--
00:30:13,00:30:15,they have special antimicrobial pants.
00:30:15,00:30:16,Yeah.
00:30:16,00:30:17,"And you can wear them for months on end,"
00:30:17,00:30:19,because if you're deployed somewhere
00:30:19,00:30:20,"where you're going to be for months on end,"
00:30:20,00:30:22,I suppose it's useful.
00:30:22,00:30:22,So that's--
00:30:22,00:30:24,They could have just had that little bit of plastic
00:30:24,00:30:25,and they wouldn't have had to do that.
00:30:25,00:30:27,I feel like I missed a trick.
00:30:27,00:30:28,Just laminate that shit.
00:30:28,00:30:30,The British Army has a combat cod piece.
00:30:30,00:30:31,Really?
00:30:31,00:30:33,Very similar to this nappy.
00:30:33,00:30:35,"Yeah, they started issuing them in 2010."
00:30:35,00:30:38,And it's actually a three-tier system.
00:30:38,00:30:40,So they have--
00:30:40,00:30:43,it's basically a special detective underwear.
00:30:43,00:30:43,It solves crimes.
00:30:43,00:30:46,It's special protective underwear
00:30:46,00:30:50,"against explosives, missiles, stuff like that."
00:30:50,00:30:50,And the--
00:30:50,00:30:51,The missiles.
00:30:51,00:30:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:54,00:30:56,It's incredibly powerful.
00:30:56,00:30:58,If the Army's ever up against someone who fires missiles
00:30:58,00:31:02,"at individual soldiers' cocks, I say we surrender."
00:31:03,00:31:05,"I thought when you said it was a combat nappy,"
00:31:05,00:31:06,"that it was the other way around,"
00:31:06,00:31:09,as in it was like there was a gun down there that could fire.
00:31:09,00:31:11,That would be cool.
00:31:11,00:31:14,A little bit like Liz Hurley's nipples in Austin House.
00:31:14,00:31:15,"Exactly, yeah."
00:31:15,00:31:18,"And then the phrase, you could say, oh, is that a gun in your--"
00:31:18,00:31:19,"Oh, it is a gun in your pocket."
00:31:19,00:31:19,"Yes, it is."
00:31:19,00:31:21,It wasn't nappy.
00:31:21,00:31:23,"I didn't say nappy, because it sounds more sexy"
00:31:23,00:31:24,than the ones James was talking about.
00:31:24,00:31:25,It's the combat cod piece.
00:31:25,00:31:26,The cod piece.
00:31:26,00:31:28,It's actually made up of ballistic silk.
00:31:28,00:31:31,It sounds like a really angry silk.
00:31:31,00:31:32,Yeah.
00:31:32,00:31:34,But-- and then it has--
00:31:34,00:31:36,it's one layer of ballistic silk.
00:31:36,00:31:40,And then it's one layer of detachable armored modular trousers.
00:31:40,00:31:42,"It sounds like something out of Wallace and Gromit,"
00:31:42,00:31:45,but apparently it's crucial in Afghanistan.
00:31:45,00:31:46,"Wow, wow."
00:31:46,00:31:48,I've devised a little game for us to play.
00:31:48,00:31:48,"Oh, great."
00:31:48,00:31:51,"It's like, you know, the player card's right."
00:31:51,00:31:52,We had to bid higher or lower.
00:31:52,00:31:55,"Is that, basically, but with celebrity underpanned auctions?"
00:31:55,00:31:57,"OK, OK."
00:31:57,00:31:59,So Eva Braun.
00:31:59,00:32:00,Yes.
00:32:00,00:32:02,Guess how much her pants went for?
00:32:02,00:32:02,Hitler's better half.
00:32:02,00:32:05,Pounds.
00:32:05,00:32:06,We're going to go in pounds.
00:32:06,00:32:06,"Yeah, please."
00:32:06,00:32:07,"All right, OK."
00:32:07,00:32:09,"6,000 pounds."
00:32:09,00:32:10,"3,700."
00:32:10,00:32:11,All right.
00:32:11,00:32:12,"Now we get into the higher or lower bit,"
00:32:12,00:32:14,because I thought I was just setting you up with that one.
00:32:14,00:32:15,"Oh, right."
00:32:15,00:32:15,Sorry.
00:32:15,00:32:17,If you thought that wasn't exciting enough.
00:32:17,00:32:18,Yeah.
00:32:18,00:32:20,"OK, Queen Victoria, higher or lower?"
00:32:20,00:32:20,Higher.
00:32:20,00:32:22,"Higher, because they were huge, weren't they, Queen Victoria?"
00:32:22,00:32:23,Absolutely right.
00:32:23,00:32:26,"It's not done on acreage, but yes, you're absolutely right."
00:32:26,00:32:27,They were bigger.
00:32:27,00:32:29,"12,090 pounds."
00:32:29,00:32:30,"OK, they were dead."
00:32:30,00:32:31,"Right, Michael Jordan."
00:32:31,00:32:32,Next up.
00:32:32,00:32:32,Higher.
00:32:32,00:32:33,Lower.
00:32:33,00:32:34,James is right.
00:32:34,00:32:37,"Michael Jordan's pants went for 2,400 quid in 2021."
00:32:37,00:32:39,"Queen Victoria or Michael Jordan, come on, guys."
00:32:39,00:32:41,Greatest possible player of all time.
00:32:41,00:32:41,"All right, all right, all right."
00:32:41,00:32:43,"Queen Victoria, Queen of England."
00:32:43,00:32:45,"Probably not that good at basketball,"
00:32:45,00:32:46,but good at lots of other things.
00:32:46,00:32:47,They thought it was going to be boring.
00:32:47,00:32:48,They're fighting over this now.
00:32:48,00:32:50,Elvis Presley.
00:32:50,00:32:51,Next.
00:32:51,00:32:52,Lower.
00:32:52,00:32:53,He never wore underwear.
00:32:53,00:32:54,Trick question.
00:32:54,00:32:59,He did wear them and they did not sell.
00:33:00,00:33:01,Can you believe that?
00:33:01,00:33:03,They were up for auction and they didn't sell.
00:33:03,00:33:05,Are they the ones he pooed himself in?
00:33:05,00:33:06,Because he did poo himself in.
00:33:06,00:33:07,Didn't he poo himself?
00:33:07,00:33:09,"Well, he died on the toilet."
00:33:09,00:33:09,Yeah.
00:33:09,00:33:10,Are they his death pants?
00:33:10,00:33:11,"No, I don't think..."
00:33:11,00:33:14,Because no one wants their death pants.
00:33:14,00:33:15,"I don't think there is death pants,"
00:33:15,00:33:17,"but they were a little marked, but they..."
00:33:17,00:33:19,Come on.
00:33:19,00:33:20,I said marked.
00:33:20,00:33:21,What do you want?
00:33:21,00:33:22,They were macchiato.
00:33:22,00:33:23,"Look, whichever way you want to phrase it,"
00:33:23,00:33:26,they were not pristine.
00:33:26,00:33:26,OK.
00:33:26,00:33:28,And that may have been the reason they didn't sell.
00:33:28,00:33:29,I doubt it.
00:33:29,00:33:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:31,00:33:31,Elvis fans.
00:33:31,00:33:33,"Oh, skid marks from Elvis?"
00:33:33,00:33:34,They didn't sell.
00:33:34,00:33:36,"Yeah, probably because they didn't meet the reserve price,"
00:33:36,00:33:37,which would be higher.
00:33:37,00:33:37,Next question.
00:33:37,00:33:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:39,00:33:41,"I've written Herman Goering,"
00:33:41,00:33:43,and I then didn't write down the price that they went for.
00:33:43,00:33:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:45,00:33:46,You'd never have got that from Brucie.
00:33:46,00:33:50,Did you know who makes British Army bras?
00:33:50,00:33:52,And...
00:33:52,00:33:52,Ooh.
00:33:52,00:33:54,"No, it's like a sort of..."
00:33:54,00:33:55,Victoria's Secret.
00:33:55,00:33:56,Marks and Spencer.
00:33:56,00:33:58,No.
00:33:58,00:33:59,Two ends of the spectrum.
00:33:59,00:33:59,Yeah.
00:33:59,00:34:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:01,00:34:03,"Shows your different tastes, and that's fine."
00:34:03,00:34:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:06,00:34:09,"Well, they only started being issued bras in 2021."
00:34:09,00:34:11,It's a booby-doo.
00:34:11,00:34:12,Booby-doo.
00:34:12,00:34:13,Booby-doo.
00:34:13,00:34:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:14,00:34:17,The company Booby-doo supplies the bras
00:34:17,00:34:18,with the British Army now.
00:34:18,00:34:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:20,00:34:21,Wow.
00:34:21,00:34:22,"I would have taken it as a while to get that, I reckon."
00:34:22,00:34:23,"Yeah, it would."
00:34:23,00:34:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:25,00:34:28,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:34:28,00:34:29,And that is Anna.
00:34:29,00:34:32,My fact is that it takes two to four months
00:34:32,00:34:35,to train a dog to keep still in an MRI scanner.
00:34:35,00:34:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:38,00:34:39,"Yeah, I found this out recently."
00:34:39,00:34:42,I was just reading about a study that did some brain scans
00:34:42,00:34:45,"on 18 dogs, a whole range of dogs."
00:34:45,00:34:48,"And I thought, well, I wonder how that works."
00:34:48,00:34:51,"Because, you know, one of those people who bit in MRI scanners,"
00:34:51,00:34:53,"lots of us probably have, and you have to keep pretty bloody still."
00:34:53,00:34:56,"So I looked it up, and there's a study in 2018"
00:34:56,00:35:00,"titled Clinical Findings in Dogs, Trained for Awake MRI."
00:35:00,00:35:03,"And yeah, they've researched this properly."
00:35:03,00:35:04,"And there's a specific trainer, actually,"
00:35:04,00:35:09,"called Marta Gatchi, who described the process."
00:35:09,00:35:12,And it takes between five and 20 sessions without the scanner.
00:35:12,00:35:14,"So before you're even entering the room with the scanner,"
00:35:14,00:35:16,you've got to get the dog used to keeping stills.
00:35:16,00:35:19,Is it easier to get them into a CAT scan?
00:35:19,00:35:20,It's-- [LAUGHTER]
00:35:20,00:35:21,"No, you've become confused."
00:35:21,00:35:22,Now come on.
00:35:22,00:35:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:25,00:35:28,"Yeah, so you introduce them to the scanner."
00:35:28,00:35:31,"You can't food train them with treats,"
00:35:31,00:35:33,"because you can't give a treat to a dog in a scanner,"
00:35:33,00:35:34,because that ruins the whole thing.
00:35:34,00:35:35,You have to start again.
00:35:35,00:35:37,They're not even allowed to lick their lips.
00:35:37,00:35:40,"So they have to sit still for, what, like 10, 15 minutes."
00:35:40,00:35:42,And if a dog so much as drools--
00:35:42,00:35:44,"So this is why you can't food train them,"
00:35:44,00:35:46,"because if a dog is waiting for a treat,"
00:35:46,00:35:47,they start to salivate.
00:35:47,00:35:50,"And if they're in the MRI scanner and starting to salivate,"
00:35:50,00:35:52,"then they start to dribble a bit,"
00:35:52,00:35:54,"then they lick their lips, then they fucks it up,"
00:35:54,00:35:56,and you don't get the crucial brain scan.
00:35:56,00:35:58,I'm not sure I could go 10 to 15 minutes without licking
00:35:58,00:36:00,"my lips, genuinely."
00:36:00,00:36:00,Yeah.
00:36:00,00:36:02,And I'm a very creepy guy.
00:36:02,00:36:05,So that's-- [LAUGHTER]
00:36:05,00:36:06,But everyone's got their threshold.
00:36:06,00:36:08,"I was going to say, do you know someone else who can't stay"
00:36:08,00:36:10,still in MRI scanners?
00:36:10,00:36:12,And that is men.
00:36:12,00:36:12,"Oh, really?"
00:36:12,00:36:14,"Yeah, because when you look--"
00:36:14,00:36:17,"when you put a man and a woman in an MRI scanner,"
00:36:17,00:36:20,the man will almost always move around more than the woman.
00:36:20,00:36:23,And that means that you're not getting correct readings
00:36:23,00:36:24,from each person.
00:36:24,00:36:26,And it means that a lot of the studies that have been done
00:36:26,00:36:28,between men and women in MRI scanners
00:36:28,00:36:31,"might not be 100% true, because the men are wiggling around"
00:36:31,00:36:32,so much.
00:36:32,00:36:32,OK.
00:36:32,00:36:34,And why are they wiggling?
00:36:34,00:36:35,Because they're men.
00:36:35,00:36:35,What do you guys do?
00:36:35,00:36:36,Why do men wiggle?
00:36:36,00:36:37,They're probably adjusting themselves.
00:36:37,00:36:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:38,00:36:39,Yeah?
00:36:39,00:36:40,Possible.
00:36:40,00:36:40,I don't know.
00:36:40,00:36:42,I'm in there licking my lips all the time.
00:36:42,00:36:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:43,00:36:45,"The dog thing, they found out quite a lot of interesting stuff"
00:36:45,00:36:48,about dogs as a result of the ones they managed to get in there.
00:36:48,00:36:51,"And one thing that they found out was that dogs really,"
00:36:51,00:36:53,genuinely love us as humans.
00:36:53,00:36:55,"Like, they properly-- the bits of their brain"
00:36:55,00:36:58,that activate when bits of them are reminded of us
00:36:58,00:36:59,while they're in there.
00:36:59,00:37:02,"So there's like, if aromas are brought in,"
00:37:02,00:37:04,"if there's a human aroma that comes in,"
00:37:04,00:37:06,it activates this sort of reward center
00:37:06,00:37:09,"it's called, where it sort of shows that they're like,"
00:37:09,00:37:10,"oh my god, it's my owner."
00:37:10,00:37:11,This is so exciting.
00:37:11,00:37:14,And that's a connection that we realize is a real thing now.
00:37:14,00:37:17,"Because you always think, if a dog notices, for example,"
00:37:17,00:37:19,"if you're feeling a bit moody, or you think,"
00:37:19,00:37:21,"oh, the dog is picking up on my sympathy,"
00:37:21,00:37:23,it's not that it's just noticing and changing.
00:37:23,00:37:26,"It's, look, it's genuinely concerned for you."
00:37:26,00:37:27,It can follow your emotions.
00:37:27,00:37:29,And that's what they were looking at.
00:37:29,00:37:32,"And even if there was a group of aromas,"
00:37:32,00:37:35,they found that the dog would try and prioritize
00:37:35,00:37:38,"finding the human smell within that, just to be like,"
00:37:38,00:37:41,"yeah, my owner's here, or a human I know is here."
00:37:41,00:37:42,How pathetic is it that--
00:37:42,00:37:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:44,00:37:46,"What a nice story you had, Dan."
00:37:46,00:37:48,"We-- sorry, that's lovely, blah, blah, blah."
00:37:48,00:37:51,How pathetic is it that humans have gone to all the trouble
00:37:51,00:37:53,of making this extraordinary machine
00:37:53,00:37:56,just to absolutely make sure that dogs love us?
00:37:56,00:37:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:58,00:38:00,"The guys were all there, from them wagging their tails."
00:38:00,00:38:02,They were excited when we come home.
00:38:02,00:38:03,"Let's just go, Trey."
00:38:03,00:38:05,I don't think that was the primary reason
00:38:05,00:38:06,for the building of the MRI.
00:38:06,00:38:08,It was the most amazing thing I've ever done.
00:38:08,00:38:09,"Just quickly, do you know that there are no--"
00:38:09,00:38:11,almost no guide dogs called Neil?
00:38:11,00:38:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:13,00:38:14,Almost none.
00:38:14,00:38:15,"I can't guarantee there are none,"
00:38:15,00:38:16,because I haven't really checked.
00:38:16,00:38:17,"But, you know--"
00:38:17,00:38:19,Is that-- are there any called Fletch?
00:38:19,00:38:20,Exactly.
00:38:20,00:38:23,This is why-- so probably not.
00:38:23,00:38:23,Yeah.
00:38:23,00:38:26,Because you can't-- you shouldn't name a guide dog
00:38:26,00:38:28,after very common commands.
00:38:28,00:38:29,Or something that sounds like a very common command.
00:38:29,00:38:31,So Neil sounds like Heel.
00:38:31,00:38:32,Fletch sounds like Fetch.
00:38:32,00:38:34,"Kit shouldn't be chosen, because it sounds like Sit."
00:38:34,00:38:36,So there are all sorts of names.
00:38:36,00:38:36,"Anyway, that's what--"
00:38:36,00:38:38,Neil also sounds like Neil.
00:38:38,00:38:40,I don't know why you didn't go for that.
00:38:40,00:38:40,That's what I thought.
00:38:40,00:38:42,"But then when you were saying that,"
00:38:42,00:38:44,"I was thinking, did the dog's kneel down?"
00:38:44,00:38:44,"Yeah, sure."
00:38:44,00:38:47,"What is the-- what's the common dog command, saying Neil?"
00:38:47,00:38:49,"Ah, remember-- I mean, I can't think of a--"
00:38:49,00:38:50,The root that you love me.
00:38:50,00:38:51,The root that you love me.
00:38:51,00:38:52,Kneel down now.
00:38:52,00:38:54,"I can't think of dog specifically in this,"
00:38:54,00:38:56,but think of the opening scene of The Lion King
00:38:56,00:38:59,"when Simba's lift up, and they all go down to sort of--"
00:38:59,00:38:59,"Okay, again, again."
00:38:59,00:39:00,I'm sure--
00:39:00,00:39:02,"No, right. Simba is a fucking cat."
00:39:02,00:39:03,Not a dog.
00:39:03,00:39:04,"No, I-- I--"
00:39:04,00:39:05,"Well, to be fair, they're both mammals."
00:39:05,00:39:06,They are mammals.
00:39:06,00:39:09,"I prefer that by saying,"
00:39:09,00:39:11,I'm not sure there were dogs in that scene.
00:39:11,00:39:14,"I'm just saying, we do know they do it."
00:39:14,00:39:15,"Animals, they do do it."
00:39:15,00:39:16,"They do do it, and it has--"
00:39:16,00:39:18,But it's not a common dog.
00:39:18,00:39:20,It's like Fetch rollover.
00:39:20,00:39:21,That's it.
00:39:21,00:39:23,It has recently become quite popular for dogs
00:39:23,00:39:26,to take the knee out of respect sometimes.
00:39:26,00:39:26,It has.
00:39:26,00:39:30,It was not way up to speak with it.
00:39:30,00:39:31,At football matches.
00:39:31,00:39:33,"Those before crufts, before it starts,"
00:39:33,00:39:34,"they all take the knee, don't they?"
00:39:34,00:39:35,"Yeah, yeah."
00:39:35,00:39:37,"Oh, my goodness."
00:39:37,00:39:40,Have you guys heard of the 20-inch high club?
00:39:40,00:39:42,Certainly have.
00:39:42,00:39:43,Certainly have.
00:39:43,00:39:46,Go on.
00:39:46,00:39:49,The 20-inch high club is for people
00:39:49,00:39:52,"a very elite group of people,"
00:39:52,00:39:54,a small group who have had sex inside.
00:39:54,00:39:55,In the model-- in the model plane.
00:39:55,00:39:55,"No, no."
00:39:55,00:39:59,"No, in one of those planes,"
00:39:59,00:40:01,"in a children's, like, shopping centre."
00:40:01,00:40:06,Pop another pound in there.
00:40:06,00:40:12,Elite.
00:40:12,00:40:14,"This elite club, of course."
00:40:14,00:40:15,It's a very small group of people
00:40:15,00:40:19,"who have had sex inside of an MRI scanner,"
00:40:19,00:40:22,and the reason it's called the 20-inch high club
00:40:22,00:40:26,is because that's the height and space of the hole
00:40:26,00:40:27,that you go into.
00:40:27,00:40:29,Grykey.
00:40:29,00:40:32,That the couple go into.
00:40:32,00:40:36,"Those-- the initial people who first held that study,"
00:40:36,00:40:38,"it was a scientist from the University of Groningen,"
00:40:38,00:40:39,actually.
00:40:39,00:40:40,"We've played a game in Groningen, and it was--"
00:40:40,00:40:42,There was a lot of Groningen going on there.
00:40:42,00:40:47,"Willie Broad Weimar Schultz was the scientist,"
00:40:47,00:40:48,and he scanned a couple.
00:40:48,00:40:50,But it was very hard to do.
00:40:50,00:40:52,It was very hard to get the couple to get the images
00:40:52,00:40:55,"they needed, because this was what you had to do."
00:40:55,00:40:57,You had to hold perfectly still for a complete minute.
00:40:57,00:41:00,And that's quite hard to do.
00:41:00,00:41:01,The only couple who were able to do it
00:41:01,00:41:03,were Amateur Street acrobats.
00:41:03,00:41:06,And so they had the experience and flexibility
00:41:06,00:41:07,to-- Right.
00:41:07,00:41:08,--to get that right.
00:41:08,00:41:10,To hold still during sex for a minute.
00:41:10,00:41:10,For a minute.
00:41:10,00:41:12,Please.
00:41:12,00:41:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:19,00:41:22,"I've got to say, this podcast is going"
00:41:22,00:41:25,"to be about 12 minutes long, when it goes out."
00:41:25,00:41:27,Shall we?
00:41:27,00:41:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:27,00:41:28,There was-- no.
00:41:28,00:41:31,"OK, can I tell you about one other study in this--"
00:41:31,00:41:32,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:41:32,00:41:33,There was a--
00:41:33,00:41:34,Why not?
00:41:34,00:41:36,"Kate Sukel, she was called."
00:41:36,00:41:37,"She was writing a book about science and sex,"
00:41:37,00:41:39,and she had to--
00:41:39,00:41:40,"the study that was being done on her,"
00:41:40,00:41:42,she had to have an orgasm inside an MRI machine.
00:41:42,00:41:44,"But, you know, by herself."
00:41:44,00:41:47,"And but, as Anna and Dan have said,"
00:41:47,00:41:49,the thing is you have to be very still
00:41:49,00:41:50,inside the MRI machine.
00:41:50,00:41:51,And it's very hard.
00:41:51,00:41:55,"And so like training the dogs to be incredibly still,"
00:41:55,00:41:56,she had to train herself.
00:41:56,00:41:57,And this was the mechanism.
00:41:57,00:41:59,She wrote an article in The Guardian all about it.
00:41:59,00:42:01,Amazing account.
00:42:01,00:42:03,She said she wasn't quite sure she could manage
00:42:03,00:42:06,to get all the way there under those incredibly still
00:42:06,00:42:07,"circumstances, because she was--"
00:42:07,00:42:09,"she had to be in a helmet, which was screwed to the bed."
00:42:09,00:42:11,So incredibly still.
00:42:11,00:42:13,But she managed it.
00:42:13,00:42:16,"She managed the training program by attaching a small bell,"
00:42:16,00:42:17,"which belonged to her cat,"
00:42:17,00:42:19,"to her forehead with some duct tape,"
00:42:19,00:42:21,and then practiced getting there
00:42:21,00:42:23,with the minimum jingling possible.
00:42:23,00:42:26,What?
00:42:26,00:42:28,So she strapped--
00:42:28,00:42:30,She strapped her cat's bell to her forehead with duct tape.
00:42:30,00:42:31,"Yeah, yeah, I got that bit."
00:42:31,00:42:31,Yeah.
00:42:31,00:42:33,And then practiced having an orgasm
00:42:33,00:42:34,without hearing the bell go once.
00:42:34,00:42:35,Oh.
00:42:35,00:42:36,To stay still so that she then stays still.
00:42:36,00:42:38,That was the practicing before she came in.
00:42:38,00:42:38,"Before she went into the machine, yeah."
00:42:38,00:42:40,She wasn't turned on by cat bells.
00:42:40,00:42:43,"I mean, by the end of this process,"
00:42:43,00:42:44,she probably was.
00:42:44,00:42:46,"OK, wow, that's amazing."
00:42:46,00:42:49,Have you guys heard of Dr. Didge?
00:42:49,00:42:51,No.
00:42:51,00:42:53,"This is a guy called Graham Wiggins,"
00:42:53,00:42:57,and he helped to develop the technology for MRI scanners.
00:42:57,00:42:58,"OK, so without him,"
00:42:58,00:43:01,we wouldn't have all of the really sharp images
00:43:01,00:43:02,that we have today.
00:43:02,00:43:06,And most of his Wikipedia page
00:43:06,00:43:08,is down to a type of didgeridoo
00:43:08,00:43:11,"that he invented, which has got keys in it."
00:43:11,00:43:15,"OK, he invented it out of cardboard wrapping paper tube,"
00:43:15,00:43:17,and he only made one of them.
00:43:17,00:43:20,"He used it for one gig, and it fell apart."
00:43:20,00:43:24,But then he later on played with the Grateful Dead
00:43:24,00:43:26,playing the didgeridoo.
00:43:26,00:43:27,Cool.
00:43:27,00:43:29,"He's like an amazing didgeridoo player,"
00:43:29,00:43:31,but he also was one of the main people
00:43:31,00:43:32,behind inventing the MRI scanner.
00:43:32,00:43:34,You can definitely see the relationship
00:43:34,00:43:35,between a didgeridoo and an MRI scanner.
00:43:35,00:43:37,You just hope that the MRI scanner
00:43:37,00:43:38,doesn't fall apart after one goes.
00:43:38,00:43:40,Because of the noise that it makes.
00:43:40,00:43:42,Because you go in a big tube and there's a big noise.
00:43:42,00:43:43,"Yeah, yeah."
00:43:43,00:43:44,Big horrible sound.
00:43:44,00:43:47,"You know fMRI scanners,"
00:43:47,00:43:49,so that's a functional MRI scanner.
00:43:49,00:43:51,It's there for your brain.
00:43:51,00:43:54,But you can also get a non-functional MRI scanner.
00:43:54,00:43:56,There's one of these at the University of Michigan.
00:43:56,00:43:59,"And what the point of this is,"
00:43:59,00:44:02,"is you go in and it doesn't do anything it's supposed to do,"
00:44:02,00:44:05,but it makes all the noises that an MRI scanner makes.
00:44:05,00:44:07,"So it kind of makes an MRI scanner,"
00:44:07,00:44:08,if you've ever been in one.
00:44:08,00:44:09,"It makes this really kind of,"
00:44:09,00:44:11,"it's the magnets are really, really strong."
00:44:11,00:44:12,And it's like this banging.
00:44:12,00:44:15,"And all this really, really loud noise."
00:44:15,00:44:16,That's a didgeridoo.
00:44:16,00:44:21,"And people feel like they can sometimes,"
00:44:21,00:44:24,some people actually can make out a tune.
00:44:24,00:44:26,Like their brain turns this really weird noise
00:44:26,00:44:27,into a kind of tune.
00:44:27,00:44:27,"Oh, cool."
00:44:27,00:44:29,"And if you want to study that,"
00:44:29,00:44:32,you can't just put loads of people in an MRI scanner
00:44:32,00:44:34,"because there's too much, you know,"
00:44:34,00:44:35,electromagnetism and stuff.
00:44:35,00:44:37,"And so they need to put them in this fake MRI scanner,"
00:44:37,00:44:38,"which has all the noises,"
00:44:38,00:44:40,and you can see what's going on with people.
00:44:40,00:44:41,Wow.
00:44:41,00:44:42,"Wait, but if it's fake,"
00:44:42,00:44:43,then you can't see what's going on in their brains
00:44:43,00:44:44,"because it's fake, right?"
00:44:44,00:44:45,"Yeah, so it's more experienced."
00:44:45,00:44:47,They're not looking at their brains.
00:44:47,00:44:48,It's the experience side.
00:44:48,00:44:49,"I see, okay."
00:44:49,00:44:49,That's the other thing.
00:44:49,00:44:54,You know the ASMR that people report about having?
00:44:54,00:44:57,So that's the idea that if you watch a video on YouTube
00:44:57,00:44:59,"of someone ironing,"
00:44:59,00:45:00,"it gives you a sort of brain fuzz,"
00:45:00,00:45:02,like goosebumps around your head.
00:45:02,00:45:06,"It's any noise that's, or some people say,"
00:45:06,00:45:09,"""I'm whispering now, and I'm rubbing the cloth"
00:45:09,00:45:10,"between my fingers."""
00:45:10,00:45:11,And that kind of...
00:45:11,00:45:12,"Some people listen in,"
00:45:12,00:45:13,"so they're like, ""Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!"""
00:45:13,00:45:17,But so that's an interesting thing.
00:45:17,00:45:18,It's very sensitive.
00:45:18,00:45:20,"It gives some people a really, yeah."
00:45:20,00:45:21,"Exactly, yeah."
00:45:21,00:45:23,And they're trying to work out
00:45:23,00:45:24,what it is in the brain that does that.
00:45:24,00:45:26,So obviously an MRI scanner is the way to find that out.
00:45:26,00:45:28,"Unfortunately, it's too noisy in there"
00:45:28,00:45:29,to even begin that
00:45:29,00:45:31,because it just breaks the spell of it.
00:45:31,00:45:33,So we can't work out what it is yet.
00:45:33,00:45:35,"Shit, what a terrible loss to medicine"
00:45:35,00:45:37,that we'll never know why people get turned on
00:45:37,00:45:39,by weirdos whispering to them on YouTube.
00:45:39,00:45:42,Fuck.
00:45:42,00:45:44,I guess we'll just have to keep curing cancer.
00:45:44,00:45:48,"Guys, I'm going to have to wrap us up."
00:45:48,00:45:49,"I know, okay."
00:45:49,00:45:50,"Yeah, we're out of time."
00:45:50,00:45:51,"Okay, that's it."
00:45:51,00:45:52,That is all of our facts.
