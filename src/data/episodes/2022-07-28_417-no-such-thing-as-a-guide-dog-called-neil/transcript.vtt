WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.580
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.700
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.520
 coming to you live from Belfast.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.520
 (audience cheering)

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.620
 (audience cheering)

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.180
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.500
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.780
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.300
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.360
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.620
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.120
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.600
 - Okay, my fact this week is that during the festival

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.320
 of Britain in London in 1951,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.040
 children would deliberately go missing

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.720
 because the local police station,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.520
 where they waited for their parents,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.720
 had the capital's best collection of comic books.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.520
 (audience laughing)

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.600
 - That's incredible.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.120
 - This was a huge big deal.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.360
 1951, this is the festival of Britain,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.440
 probably the last massive festival we had in the UK

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.000
 before the Millennium Dome was built.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.360
 And this.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.760
 - Don't laugh at the--

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.880
 (audience laughing)

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.960
 - It was a huge success in some measures.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.240
 (audience laughing)

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.440
 - Number of domes.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.240
 - Yeah, huge.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.840
 - But yeah, the festival of Britain,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.840
 there was an amazing thing.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.480
 They had all these incredible buildings and structures

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.040
 and exhibitions all over the UK and London,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.440
 and Edinburgh, and the Belfast, in fact.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.360
 They did have quite a lot here.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.800
 But then it was in 1951, and by 1952,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.040
 the entire thing had been demolished.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.760
 There was no TV really in those days.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.200
 It was really the early days of TV.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.760
 And so these days, I think it's quite forgotten

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.320
 the festival of Britain.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.440
 But when you look into it, it was absolutely amazing.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.240
 - And what's extraordinary about it as well,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.840
 so it was the South Bank in London

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.520
 where the Royal Festival Hall is now,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.320
 which is a very iconic venue.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.000
 And I've been there many, many times.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.440
 Didn't realize it was built for the festival of Britain.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.880
 It was part of the big structure.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.640
 So the whole of this South Bank right along the Thames

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.400
 was just turned into this place of the future.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.320
 And when you see pictures of it,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.520
 it is extraordinary what was there.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.360
 - It is.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.480
 And it was built basically to cheer people up a bit

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.040
 after a little war-type episode, wasn't it?

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.440
 - A little run-in with the Germans.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.360
 - A little small run-in.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.160
 And it seems like it worked.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.280
 It seemed to be pretty successful.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.680
 So they had, my favorite piece of the festival of Britain

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.520
 was the, like one of the centerpieces

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520
 was the Guinness Festival Clock,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.640
 which was, it was in Battersea Park.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.000
 It was 25 feet high.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.240
 It said it was the most complicated clock mechanism

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.040
 for 300 years.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.520
 Which, what happened to clocks 300 years earlier?

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.920
 Where they just, they just forgot

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.240
 how to make them properly.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.280
 But it was amazing.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.720
 What I quite like about the Guinness Festival Clock

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.000
 is nowhere, is it explained why this,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.080
 one of these centerpieces of the Great Exhibition

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.760
 was something that is made by an Irish company,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.720
 which, I don't know if you know this, Belfast,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.960
 was not part of the United Kingdom at that time.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.680
 And, nor is it now.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.360
 And by two Polish designers.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.800
 And it's never mentioned,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.040
 but it sounds incredible.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.440
 So they had the whole Guinness menagerie.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.880
 So, you know, back in the olden days,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.920
 Guinness was advertised by all these animals.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.640
 Like, there was a toucan, wasn't there?

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.760
 Toucan is the big one, the main event, yeah.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.720
 They had a crocodile.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.880
 They had a pelican, a bear, a lion, a kinkajou.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.640
 All these typically British, classic kinkajou.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.800
 Kinkajou, you know.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.720
 You see them wandering up the South Bank sometimes.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.520
 It's a real British, some kind of South American.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.720
 Do you mean pikachu?

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.280
 Yes, they had pikachu.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.560
 It's like a weird looking mammal,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.880
 a cute South American mammal.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.280
 Yeah, what kind, what kind of mammal?

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.600
 Like a bird or a...

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.360
 No, like a bird.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.120
 Sorry, back, wait.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.280
 Hang on. No, no, no, no, no.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.840
 You can't pull that back, then.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.920
 So Anna, what kind of mammal?

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.920
 Like a lizard or like a fish or a...

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.000
 It was an insect, but...

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.360
 What kind of mammal are you talking about?

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.040
 Oh, fucking, 'cause he made that joke.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.600
 It's gonna stay at the show now, isn't it?

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.200
 That was always gonna stay at the show

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.360
 the moment that left your mouth, I'm afraid.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.160
 I suspect it's not the last you're gonna hear of that, fuck off.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.680
 Well, OK, so now we all know birds aren't mammals, great.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.280
 You'll welcome everyone else at home who had to have me

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.280
 take the bullet to get that bit of information out there.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.880
 We've all learned something today.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.400
 OK. But are they all danced around?

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.200
 So what was it, though? Like, did we find out?

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.600
 Was it like a spider or was it...

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.800
 It looks a bit like a sloth.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.040
 It's a little... It looks a bit like a sloth.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.360
 Like a cute, slothy type.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.800
 Like a possum or something. OK, looks a bit like that.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.360
 Great. The furry thing.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.400
 Anyway, they jumped out of this clock and danced around constantly,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.760
 and the ostrich would come out, which had beer, glass, ice.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.760
 Not a marble.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.240
 Part of the bird family, I believe, is it?

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.640
 Very strong. Cool.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.360
 Yeah, it was very cool.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.800
 On the other... I mean, there was so much stuff in London,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.080
 but it was genuinely all across the country.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.800
 So 18 million people across the UK

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.920
 went to one or other of the events that were local.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.160
 The Festival of Britain had its own ship, which is pretty cool.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.520
 Nice. It was called Campania,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.680
 and the ship had an amazing life, OK?

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.120
 It was truly a very versatile ship.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.760
 It was built, actually, it was built in Belfast, local ship.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.280
 It was built, yeah.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.680
 I certainly trust any ship that's been built in Belfast, by the way.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.960
 Too soon, I think, too soon.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.560
 Just a strong history.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.320
 Yeah. Anyway, it was built in Belfast,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.200
 but then the Second World War,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.600
 it was requisitioned by the military, by the navy,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.720
 used as an export carrier, OK, so it's now fine, it's a military ship,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.280
 saw some action in the Second World War,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.240
 then it was turned into the showboat for the Festival of Britain in 1951,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.200
 then it was refitted as the command ship for Operation Hurricane,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.640
 which was the test of the first ever British atomic bomb.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.280
 OK, so it sailed to Australia,

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.040
 and it had some laboratories fitted,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.680
 and it did the test, it was the, you know, main ship for that.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.720
 And then it was scrapped, so I thought, you know,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.120
 what an interesting life for a ship, guys.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.320
 Yeah, I feel like this microphone might not be, no, great story.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.240
 The Northern Ireland part of the exhibition

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.000
 was run by a guy with a brilliant name, he was called Willie De Mayo.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.840
 Isn't that cool? Willie De Mayo.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.760
 And the whole part of the whole point of the bit around Northern Ireland

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.680
 was to show the importance of hard work,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.840
 because Northern Ireland had made a really...

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.280
 Because someone in the UK had to work hard, and it was down to you guys.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.080
 They worked out that Northern Ireland had made a much bigger part

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.760
 of the recovery after the war than anywhere else in the UK.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.080
 But they also had a lot of manufacturing on site,

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.640
 because they wanted to show how many things were made here.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.840
 So they had... You could buy some festival cigarettes.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.920
 Cool. They were made while you watched, they made a cigarette,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.640
 and then you could smoke them. Nice.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.800
 They had some stuff about stockings, nylon stockings,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.280
 and the way they showed those off is they had a load of sort of dismembered legs.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.680
 They weren't real legs, they were like kind of plastic legs,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.760
 and they were in the shape of a fan, and they all had stockings on them,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.800
 and they would spin round and round and round,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.920
 and then there would be some nylon that you could kind of see

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.520
 through the spinning leg fan.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.920
 That's cool. Wow. That is cool.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.160
 Back in London, there was all these little other events that were going on,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.880
 so you would have the main features of the whole festival,

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.280
 which would be from theatre through to these caves that were built

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.720
 that were absolutely stunning.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.560
 They were like grottoes, which looked incredibly beautiful.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.680
 And then there was a French-stunt tightrope walker called Eliano.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.640
 I think that's the right pronunciation.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.640
 And he walked across the Thames, so they put a tightrope up

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.120
 the whole way through, across the Thames, and he walked it,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.080
 and near the end, he almost fell, and he went down onto one knee,

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.360
 and he stayed there for four minutes, and then he eventually got up

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.600
 and then made it to the end, and it was a success,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.440
 but it was particularly scary because Eliano didn't know how to swim.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.080
 Oh, no.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.960
 And how do you fall in? That could have been a horrific moment,

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.160
 but, like, yeah, that's pretty bold going across a giant body of water

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.840
 when you don't know how to swim.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.400
 Well, people appreciated it.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.720
 You can watch the footage of that, and 100,000 people were there,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.560
 and that's a lot of people.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.080
 It's like the entirety of London seemed to be rammed.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.520
 I guess it was when you only had two channels on TV, so nothing else to do.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.480
 I don't have no TV to watch them on.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.800
 And when are we with 51, mostly when I'm on TV?

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.880
 Well, there was a big theatre there where people went to see television

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.720
 for the first time, the first time seeing visuals, yeah.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.760
 Have you seen just with the Eliano tightrope?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.680
 Have you seen what he does when he falls onto his knee?

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.760
 No. He mouths, well, according to one newspaper writer,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.920
 he's obviously doing something, and I don't know how the journalist could see this,

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.120
 but he mouths to his wife, who was in the audience,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.480
 who was also a tightrope walker.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.600
 I can't do this, the rope's too slack, I'm going to fall.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.880
 You know, somebody help me, and she just shouted back,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.920
 "You've got to do it, you've got no choice, come on, get up, mate."

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.760
 Wow.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.760
 And that kind of tough love is what does it?

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.480
 Yeah, yeah, that's so good.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.120
 Have you heard of the role of Laurie Lee?

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.000
 Laurie Lee is author of "Sider with Rosie."

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.280
 And, go on.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.600
 What's the second famous book that Laurie Lee wrote?

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.280
 "The Old Biography of Laurie Lee."

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.920
 Yeah, exactly.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.440
 Well, it was a memoir, so that kind of was the autobiography.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.160
 Anyway, look at the point.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.920
 I was trying to help you out, though.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.280
 I'm really sorry, I wasn't biting the hand.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.360
 Anyway, he was appointed the curator of eccentrics,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.000
 because they wanted to have some fun stuff.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.360
 And he said, put an ad in the papers saying, "Send me stupid ideas,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.800
 and we'll build them, and we'll put them in the exhibition of eccentric things."

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.680
 And he got brilliant suggestions, okay?

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.640
 And they built a lot of these things, which is really cool.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.480
 So, one that they didn't build is the deflatable rubber bus

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.920
 for going under low bridges.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.720
 Ah, brilliant.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.200
 Very good.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.200
 A machine which was 20 feet by 20 feet,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.640
 and its sole purpose was to blow out a single match held in front of it.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.200
 - Okay. - That's a cool thing.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.480
 I love this one, a staircase which had weighted steps, okay?

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.600
 So, you could give someone the feeling of going upstairs

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.000
 while they were actually going downstairs.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.800
 - How cool is that? - That's the thing.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.760
 - No, not very cool at all, is it? - How does...

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.360
 - What? - You get in all the worst bit, basically,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.760
 of going upstairs, and you get in it when you're going downstairs.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.280
 Yeah, but it would be useful...

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.280
 When?

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.280
 Wait!

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.760
 It's good exercise, isn't it?

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.160
 Although, if you could do the opposite

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.360
 and give the impression of sliding down a banister,

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.920
 and then you end up on the second floor...

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.720
 - That would be amazing. - That's the way to do it, yeah.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.880
 - If you had to trick someone... - Yep.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.600
 ...to thinking that they were going upstairs

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.200
 - when they were actually going downstairs. - Yeah.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.200
 - Why would you want to do that? - You're a kidnapper.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.200
 And...

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.200
 - Okay, I'm a kidnapper. - To only the most obvious, you know.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.440
 And I want them to think that they're in the top of a building,

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.680
 - but they're actually in a basement. - Yeah.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.640
 So that later on, when they say, "Where were you kept?"

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.120
 The kidnap situation has been resolved, it's all fine.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:15.600
 And they try and escape, but they're just going deeper and deeper and deeper.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.600
 They'll be asked, you know, "Where were you being kept?"

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.880
 They say, "Well, I was upstairs."

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.280
 And so the police will be looking in places upstairs.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.520
 - Upstairs, you're right. - You're in the cellar the whole time.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.240
 And is this how they use this thing?

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.240
 It wasn't...

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.040
 Was this one of the main attractions of the Festival of Britain?

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.280
 All the kidnappers were running riot because the police were taking care of the kids, weren't they?

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.520
 It's a millennium dome, that stairs, that you could feel like you were walking upstairs

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.720
 while you were walking downstairs. It would have been a runaway hit.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.080
 You're right.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.520
 They also commissioned a lot of artists to do original art as part of this.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.880
 So they had famous artists building statues and so on.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.640
 And one of the artists they got was Henry Moore,

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.280
 and he did a reclining figure that was his piece.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.120
 And there's a story that a small boy caught his head

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.760
 under one of the legs of the reclining figure and got stuck in there.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.800
 And so the account was that they were pushing and pulling for ages,

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.480
 - trying to get this kid... - Well, pushing and pulling isn't going to work.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.640
 - Oh, from different ends, I suppose. - From different... Yeah, they were just trying to...

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.880
 Not just like for an hour that you are pushing, right?

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.080
 - No, I'm pulling! Oh, shit! - Yeah, I see you.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.760
 They shouldn't have got the Chuckle Brothers to do the extrication job.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.520
 Yeah, so what they did was they were just trying desperately to get him out.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.280
 They couldn't get him out, so then they brought huge quantities of soap over it,

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.040
 and they started sooping this boy up in order to get him out.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.520
 And they finally managed to... And they tried weird things, like...

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.760
 The soap was on his neck, it was on his body.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.840
 They finally pulled him up vertically and managed to pull him out that way.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.240
 Sorry, they put him into a flat horizontal position,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.760
 and they managed to pull him out that way,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.480
 and they said it was like a missile from the breach of a gun, like he popped out.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.240
 And his mother reported that her son's neck had never been so clean.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.440
 These are the kind of japes that were happening at the Festival of Britain.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.000
 There was another sculpture called Root Bodied Forth by someone called Mitzi Konlif,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.560
 and this was a sculpture of two bodies entwined together

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.640
 as if they're coming out of the earth.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.800
 So if you can imagine the bodies going round.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.720
 The person who was in charge of the Festival of Britain was called Sir Gerald Barry,

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.920
 and he had to go and look at this sculpture when it was being made,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.120
 because he'd been tipped off that it might be a study in sodomy.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.240
 And he concluded that if it was a study in sodomy,

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.480
 then it was one that was anatomically impossible.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.760
 Fair enough.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.560
 I can't believe that it takes someone professional to judge it.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.160
 It seems like it'd be pretty obvious to most people if there's a study in sodomy or not.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.280
 No, there's expertise in every field, Anna.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.120
 You think you're some kind of expert.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.120
 I just think we might all be experts in that.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.320
 Looking at it.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.240
 All doing it.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.440
 I'm not judging, but I'm just saying to look at most of us.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.720
 Can we should move on anyway?

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.200
 No, no, no.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.920
 I feel like this is your mammal gate, Anna.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.440
 No, it wasn't amazing.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:12.240
 But the craziest thing of all is that they spent something like 12 million pounds on it

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.520
 at the time in the '50s.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.320
 A huge amount of money.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.800
 It was funded by the Labour government.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.680
 It was Clement Attlee, who was in power at the time.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.680
 There was a guy, Herbert Morrison, who kind of was seen to be the person who was going to

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.160
 succeed Attlee, never actually did.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.480
 His grandson is Peter Mandelson, I discovered.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.800
 So it's like a history of staying in politics.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.800
 But it went up in, when was it?

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.000
 It was in- 51.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.880
 Yeah, 51, but it was in May 51, I think it was.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.800
 Churchill then didn't like it at all.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.680
 So much money went in.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.560
 It looked beautiful.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.840
 And by September of that year-

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.880
 He got back into office in that time.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.360
 Exactly.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.440
 So he got back in in that time.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.800
 And by September, they had it dismantled, this incredible thing.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.200
 Yeah, they saw it as like an emblem of socialism and this great kind of,

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.520
 all of these amazing sculptures and buildings.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.040
 They were kind of of the socialist government.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.520
 They're like, "We're having none of that. Let's get rid of it."

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:03.920
 Yeah.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.880
 It was jealous.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.840
 This is basically Lego gate from my childhood,

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.880
 when my brother managed to make the Lego pirate ship when I had failed

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.480
 and I got up in the middle of the night, went into his room and smashed it to pieces.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.240
 And that is what this was.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.200
 Right.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.320
 And at least I'm adult enough to admit that.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.480
 I bet Churchill never admitted that was what he was doing.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.840
 Have you admitted it to your brother?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.600
 Or is he going to hear this podcast?

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.040
 Fortunately, he doesn't listen to the show.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:32.400
 Very interesting, the dismantling of all this stuff.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.800
 It was really hard to dismantle because they had to do it quite quickly

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.320
 and they were losing staff all the time.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.520
 So they had like things like the single largest sheet of glass in the world at that point,

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.680
 because it was part of the telescope that they'd built.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.960
 And they didn't know how to,

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.400
 they'd had to dismantle everything around it before they could get this sheet out

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.600
 and they were losing people.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.960
 They had a train from India,

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.160
 which they couldn't put on the railway to get back to its ship in time

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.360
 because it was the wrong gauge.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.960
 Like there were all these issues and most things in there were really expensive.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.280
 So you had these security guards who were bouncers,

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:06.400
 basically protecting millions of pounds worth of items and inventions that were there.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.920
 And one of the things that they had a lot of were dust bins,

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.080
 all the bins that were around for this place.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.840
 And one person went and bought them all up or most of them.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.640
 And that was a guy called Billy Butlin who runs Butlins.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:24.000
 So if you ever went to Butlins in the late 50s and possibly through to now,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.840
 the bins that you're putting your rubbish in

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.520
 are the bins that were at the Festival of Britain.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.440
 Wait, you think that's still the same bin?

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.520
 I didn't find a photo of a recent bin.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.640
 Yeah, it could be.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.440
 I mean, they can't, you know, they don't get much wear and tear bin.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.880
 Where are you going to throw them away Anna?

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.240
 But we need to move on to our next fact.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.760
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.360
 My fact is that in the 1990s,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.960
 a British bank set up a computer system

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.240
 so they could write to all their wealthiest customers at once.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.440
 Unfortunately, due to a rogue bit of placeholder text,

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.440
 they started sending out letters which began "Dear Rich Bastard."

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:08.960
 So this was in a paper recently and the website Snopes,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.800
 who do a lot of debunking and bunking have, you checked it out.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.600
 And it did happen.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.440
 It was written up in computer weekly at the time.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.680
 It was a telecommunication firm.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.360
 They were launching a new gold card

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.360
 and they wanted to email the richest people all at once

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.840
 and see if they wanted to buy a new product.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.400
 And so one of the programmers just wrote a bit of placeholder text.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.720
 Normally, the name of the customer would be in there,

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.000
 but some of the records were a bit botched and couldn't read it.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.080
 So he just said as a little joke to himself,

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.320
 this will never go out, but it's going to be "Dear Rich Bastard."

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.520
 Anyway, he then left the project.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.680
 And it was handed on to a different programmer

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.640
 who didn't know about this.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.960
 And it was restarted.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.240
 And so they started later sending out these letters

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.520
 to "Dear Rich Bastard."

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.440
 Allegedly, they got one complaint from a customer

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.120
 who hadn't been called "Dear Rich Bastard"

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.080
 and was very offended.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.640
 "Dear Rich Bastard."

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.760
 Yeah, exactly.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.800
 It could have been sent to...

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:04.720
 There was a British Royal Naval officer in 1798 called Richard Bastard.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.200
 No.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.880
 Could have gone to him, Rich Bastard.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.560
 There was also a Rich Bastard who was born in 1788 in Cornwall.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.320
 He changed his name, actually, to Richard Bastion.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.040
 And it seems to be...

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.120
 It changed it just when he got married.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.840
 He got married to a woman called Jennifer Sincock.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.600
 And they became the Bastions.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.440
 And the other Rich Bastard...

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.040
 The only other Rich Bastard I could find,

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.640
 a real Rich Bastard, is friend of the podcast, Seaguar Bastard.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.920
 Do you remember him?

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.480
 Yeah, what did he do?

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.920
 He was a football referee.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.680
 Seaguar Bastard.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.280
 And his middle name was Richard, so he was Seaguar Rich Bastard.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.200
 And on his Wikipedia, there's a full paragraph on...

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.880
 It says there is a popular belief that because of his name,

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.440
 Bastard was the inspiration behind the chant,

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.800
 "Who's the Bastard in the Black?"

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.920
 And Wikipedia says it's unlikely that he was the inspiration

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.000
 because the colour of the clothing he wore

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.840
 while refereeing is not documented.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.960
 And football chants did not include verbal aggression

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.680
 towards officials until at least the 1960s.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.200
 Long after he had died, so...

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.160
 Thanks, Wikipedia.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.920
 Just bustin' a myth there.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.760
 I love these big mail-outs where something goes wrong.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.640
 I remember reading a story about a guy in Canada.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.200
 He went on this date and it was a really good date.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.240
 And at the end of the date,

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.880
 he got given the number of this girl, Nicole,

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.840
 who liked, you know, possibly wanted to meet up again.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.880
 So he gets home and the next day, he calls her,

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.120
 or, you know, in the next few days, calls her.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.320
 And it's the wrong number.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.680
 So he's like, "Shit, she's given me the wrong number

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.840
 by possibly one digit, I don't know."

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.280
 But how do you find Nicole, you know, in the campus

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.840
 where he was, which was the University of Calgary?

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.640
 So what he did was he tracked down all 200 Nicole's email addresses

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.520
 and he sent out a group email to all the Nicole's,

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.280
 sort of individually, saying,

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.120
 "Are you the Nicole who gave me a number?"

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.480
 I'm getting a few red flags here, I don't know about anyone else.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.960
 But what's amazing is the story became a bit big.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.000
 A Facebook page was set up between all of the Nicole's

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.280
 and they started becoming buddies.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.160
 So all these new Nicole's were like a big Nicole clan,

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.560
 all of a sudden, and they managed to find the one

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.040
 who he was looking for and she did give the wrong number

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.640
 and she did want to meet up with him again.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.040
 Oh!

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.560
 So, yeah, yeah, so it wasn't like he was being...

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.520
 She's now dead.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.600
 Wow.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.400
 Pretty amazing.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.520
 That is, yeah.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.040
 It's maybe a nice story.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.280
 It's really on the edge between creepy and romantic.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.400
 It's so close, isn't it?

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.120
 It's romantic.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.200
 They're just on these sort of mass mailing things.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.600
 I really like the errors that companies make

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.360
 because it happens a lot.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.040
 So there was a time in 2016,

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.560
 maybe someone in the room got one of these messages,

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.600
 I don't know.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.520
 One person accidentally sent a test email

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.800
 to 840,000 people in the NHS.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:52.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.040
 They accidentally did a write to everybody.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.840
 One working-age person in 40 in the country

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.720
 got an email.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.840
 That was a flub

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.360
 and it was obviously a big waste of, you know,

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.320
 gummed up the computers.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.080
 Unfortunately, they were all CC'd in, not BCC'd.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.080
 So almost immediately someone wrote saying,

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.120
 "Reply all, please take me off this mailing list."

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.440
 So another 840,000 messages went out

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.600
 and then obviously the funny people started kicking in.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.440
 In a single hour and a quarter, 500 million emails were sent.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.800
 Wow.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.760
 The NHS had basically launched a crippling attack

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.800
 on its own computers.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.880
 Didn't they actually...

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.480
 Didn't it shut down for a while?

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.440
 I seem to remember that.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.120
 It was so overloaded, didn't it?

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.600
 Yeah.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.920
 I understand that's the Tory party is saying,

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.920
 the fewer NHS staff we have,

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.600
 the less likely this will happen again.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.480
 The HBO sent a test.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.400
 I sent an email around exactly like this

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.680
 to everyone that they shouldn't have done.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.800
 It was everyone on the mailing list,

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.160
 got this kind of test email.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.440
 And someone wrote on Twitter that it happened

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.160
 and then everyone on Twitter decided to share their stories

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.000
 of when they fucked up at work.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.960
 Some of them were really good.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.520
 There was someone called @AaronChevyFord

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.560
 and they said that they'd made a PDF

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.280
 assigning each employee to the Muppet

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.720
 they reminded them of the most.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:16.880
 They said, "I meant to send it to my work friend,

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.360
 but I accidentally sent it to the entire company.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.400
 My supervisor, Beaker."

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.120
 "Wanted to fire me, but the owners, Bert and Ernie, intervened."

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.720
 So good!

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.560
 It was amazing, isn't it?

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.000
 And then there was one person called Casey,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.920
 him who also replied and they said,

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.840
 "I was using my desktop calendar

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.080
 to make a note of when I started my period,

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.600
 but after several months realized I was doing it on a calendar,

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.280
 I shared with the entire company."

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:54.320
 It's useful information, some would argue.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.160
 It's just, yeah.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.800
 I like always imagining the behind the scenes

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.080
 when these stories come out,

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.160
 because companies will do this

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.040
 and then send out an apology saying, "Websi daisies."

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.240
 And then I just imagine the person

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.640
 getting furiously fired in the background.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.880
 And there was one in 2018,

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.720
 it was the US Embassy in Australia

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.400
 sent out an email invitation

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.400
 to just all the big shot diplomats, politicians, journalists,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.080
 and the invitation simply had a cat wearing pajamas,

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.760
 holding a box of cookies with the words "Cat pajama jam."

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.360
 And it went out to, you know,

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.520
 people at the highest levels of government.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.920
 And so the Embassy sent a tweet out saying,

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.960
 "Sorry if you were looking forward to the pajama party,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.800
 don't worry, I'm afraid it's not going to happen."

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.000
 It was a training error made by one of our new staff

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.680
 and then they followed it up

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.400
 by saying that new controls will now be implemented

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.400
 so something similar doesn't happen again.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.960
 And you just know that that member of new staff,

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.920
 that one little intern has made this mistake

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.240
 and the new controls are that intern,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.360
 not being an intern anymore.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.480
 We're going to have to move on, guys.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.080
 Oh, can I tell you a thing about autofill text,

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.680
 which is kind of what the original fact is about?

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.400
 So there's a fake text generator.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.480
 The fake Latin is called loram ipsum, you know,

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.800
 when you just get, it just looks like a Latin sentence.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.520
 It's not really, it's just an old chopped up Latin text,

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.840
 basically, which looks like it sentences, but it's not.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.320
 Anyway, that's been established for hundreds of years,

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.200
 but there are new loram ipsums all the time

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.400
 and it's really exciting.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.840
 There is office ipsum.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.600
 You can get a Samuel L. Jackson ipsum.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:32.320
 And there's also, I really like an online dating profile,

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.560
 loram ipsum, basically, a text generator,

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.480
 which just generates a dating profile.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.400
 So I just wondered if you fancied hearing a bit of it.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:38.960
 Yes, please.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.600
 Okay, if you plug it in, it just gives you this.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.280
 Mountain biking, vampire weekend, exploring the city, Ethiopian.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.840
 Down to earth, snowboarding, new friends, running shoes.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.520
 If you think we have something in common,

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.120
 I'm pretty laid back, sleeping late.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.520
 Kurosawa, I have a crush on.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.040
 If you're still reading this,

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.240
 my favorite word is sushi.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.280
 Passionate about making lasagna from scratch going to the gym.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.600
 Guys, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.520
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.760
 My fact this week is that when leaving the Norwegian military,

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.360
 soldiers must now hand over their used underpants and socks

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.800
 for the next recruit to wear.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.640
 Yeah, this is breaking news.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.320
 It depends how you do it, doesn't it?

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.480
 It depends how you requisition those back.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.560
 It's not like I'm going to need your gun, your badge,

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.840
 and your pants right now.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.280
 Well, it used to be that you would give every other bit of clothing back.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.160
 Oh, but you got to keep the pants.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.440
 Yeah, you kept your pants and socks.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.160
 I was sitting there.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.640
 Yeah, but then, you know, it's been a hard time in the pandemic.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.320
 So the Norwegian defense logistics organization, Spokespeople,

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.720
 said that with proper checks and cleaning,

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.800
 the reuse of garments is considered an adequate and sound practice.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.640
 And so that's what it is now.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.920
 You've got to hand back your pants.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.400
 And I think it's fair because you hear used pants,

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.800
 and what you've heard is unwashed pants.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.760
 And that's not what they do.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.360
 They do wash them first, right?

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.280
 And do they also make them keep,

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.640
 you know, in a shop when you try on pants,

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.680
 you have to keep that plastic thing in the crotch bit.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.520
 They make them wear that the whole time as well, don't they?

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.000
 What's that bit?

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.080
 I'm not aware of this.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.000
 You know, when you go up and do a bit of stand-up,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.080
 and you're like, everyone will know what I'm talking about here.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.600
 Hang on.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.160
 What's plastic?

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.560
 I don't try on pants much in the shop.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.760
 Maybe you're not supposed to.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.160
 You know what?

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:26.960
 It's when you're trying on.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.840
 Actually, do you know what?

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.360
 It's when you're trying on the bikini bottoms.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.000
 Right.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.920
 So does anyone know what I mean, the sticky bit?

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.440
 That sounded like a lot of female voices.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.800
 So distinctly female voices there.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.520
 Yeah.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.040
 Anyway, the plastic sticky thing.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.880
 It's really useful if you don't want to get stuff dirty.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.360
 Just cover it in plastic sticky stuff.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.880
 And then you don't even need to use deodorant.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.680
 Wait, so you wear--

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.000
 Wait.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.400
 You wear--

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.240
 Have you laminated your pants?

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:52.480
 Yeah.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:52.880
 That's what I'm--

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.720
 Everything I'm wearing is laminated right now.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.280
 I feel like we're all learning so much about each other

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.560
 tonight, specifically.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.880
 It's really-- this happens a lot in armed forces.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.480
 There are lots of stories about what

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.920
 happens with their pants policy.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.600
 So for example, the Swiss army of knife fame, they only--

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.120
 They only allow their female recruits

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.720
 to wear women's pants in 2021, which

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.760
 is very recent for that shift of policy to have been made.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.000
 Until then, women were just issued with standard underwear,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.200
 which was men's pants.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.360
 I think they wouldn't have been stopped.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.840
 They weren't checking whether they were wearing women's underwear.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.760
 It was just they weren't given women's underwear

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.040
 as part of their uniform.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:37.840
 Yes, that's true.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.040
 But still, that's a--

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.280
 You know, they're not being made to feel welcome

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:41.920
 with this kind of stuff.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.960
 So anyway, they've launched a trial this year where women

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.160
 actually now get women's pants.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.360
 And they're convinced this is going

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.960
 to be a big draw for recruitment.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.360
 I'm not.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.120
 Hey, or a small draw.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.560
 It depends on your size, right?

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.240
 Is there a lot of chat between the women going,

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.040
 what's this plastic thing that's on the inside?

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.640
 But at the moment, it's only 1% of the Swiss army is women.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.640
 And they're hoping by 2030, it will be 10% just due to this pants

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.200
 thing.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:05.760
 Really?

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.400
 Yeah, maybe not.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.480
 They told more of the women about the corkscrew on the knives.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.360
 I'm telling you, they get a lot more recruits.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.520
 What do you guys think that commandos

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.600
 wear underneath their trousers?

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.600
 I'm going to press the button and say nothing at all.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.080
 No, that is the QI Klaxon.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.440
 They wear nappies, basically.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.800
 Nappies known as blast pelvic protectors.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.280
 OK.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.880
 Well, it's a scary job, isn't it?

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.200
 Which direction is the blast coming from?

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.640
 It's to stop external blasts from coming in,

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.520
 rather than the internal blast going out.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.640
 But it's because, basically, if there's an explosion

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.080
 or a mine or something like that,

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.000
 you might get some shrapnel.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.400
 And you have a lot of very important arteries,

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.320
 apart from everything else that's down there.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.480
 If you get a bit of shrapnel in your upper thigh,

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.760
 then you're done for.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.280
 And so they all have these what they call nappy protectors.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.720
 And they put those things up.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.760
 We're not sure why going commando comes from,

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.960
 where it comes from.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.640
 According to the OED, it probably

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.440
 is just because commando is a really brave and hardcore.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.760
 And it was like American school slang, college slang.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.280
 And they're like, well, if you don't wear pants,

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.920
 you're as hardcore as a commando.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.920
 But then there is some interviews with commando.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.080
 So there's an interview with Lee West, who is a commando.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.280
 And he said that they would take off their pants,

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.560
 because if they didn't,

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.120
 then there would be bacteria cultivated

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.760
 and their balls might drop off.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.880
 What?

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.560
 That's what he said.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.080
 He also said sometimes they might go into an area

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.440
 and then they would leave a pair of soiled pants

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.040
 to taunt the enemy.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.880
 And so when they came away,

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.800
 they wouldn't be wearing any pants underneath.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.000
 Rat boys, what's this?

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.560
 Yeah.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.320
 It's the most serious.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.360
 Hey, great news.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.800
 We've got Osama Bin Laden.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.200
 Right.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.200
 You, Private Smith, get your pants off.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:57.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.240
 What's the--

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.720
 Why did they think that--

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.480
 why would being commando make your balls

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.640
 any more likely to drop off in pants than anyone else?

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.360
 Jungle territory is the thing.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.600
 Possibly would have started around the Korean War

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.680
 or the Vietnam War, perhaps.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.440
 It does-- the British Army do have--

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.680
 they have special antimicrobial pants.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.080
 Yeah.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.680
 And you can wear them for months on end,

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.760
 because if you're deployed somewhere

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.880
 where you're going to be for months on end,

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.080
 I suppose it's useful.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:22.720
 So that's--

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.560
 They could have just had that little bit of plastic

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.840
 and they wouldn't have had to do that.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.040
 I feel like I missed a trick.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.400
 Just laminate that shit.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.320
 The British Army has a combat cod piece.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.920
 Really?

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.120
 Very similar to this nappy.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.360
 Yeah, they started issuing them in 2010.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.720
 And it's actually a three-tier system.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.400
 So they have--

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.120
 it's basically a special detective underwear.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:43.840
 It solves crimes.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.640
 It's special protective underwear

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.080
 against explosives, missiles, stuff like that.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:50.560
 And the--

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.200
 The missiles.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.000
 It's incredibly powerful.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.880
 If the Army's ever up against someone who fires missiles

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.720
 at individual soldiers' cocks, I say we surrender.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.280
 I thought when you said it was a combat nappy,

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.560
 that it was the other way around,

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.200
 as in it was like there was a gun down there that could fire.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.120
 That would be cool.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.240
 A little bit like Liz Hurley's nipples in Austin House.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.280
 Exactly, yeah.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.080
 And then the phrase, you could say, oh, is that a gun in your--

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.200
 Oh, it is a gun in your pocket.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:19.840
 Yes, it is.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.360
 It wasn't nappy.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.040
 I didn't say nappy, because it sounds more sexy

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.240
 than the ones James was talking about.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.680
 It's the combat cod piece.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.240
 The cod piece.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.640
 It's actually made up of ballistic silk.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.760
 It sounds like a really angry silk.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.320
 Yeah.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.160
 But-- and then it has--

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.240
 it's one layer of ballistic silk.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.480
 And then it's one layer of detachable armored modular trousers.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.480
 It sounds like something out of Wallace and Gromit,

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.200
 but apparently it's crucial in Afghanistan.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.240
 Wow, wow.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.160
 I've devised a little game for us to play.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:48.720
 Oh, great.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.200
 It's like, you know, the player card's right.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.800
 We had to bid higher or lower.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.280
 Is that, basically, but with celebrity underpanned auctions?

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.440
 OK, OK.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.520
 So Eva Braun.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.800
 Yes.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.000
 Guess how much her pants went for?

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.960
 Hitler's better half.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.200
 Pounds.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.160
 We're going to go in pounds.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:06.720
 Yeah, please.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.040
 All right, OK.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.520
 6,000 pounds.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.720
 3,700.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.120
 All right.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.640
 Now we get into the higher or lower bit,

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.640
 because I thought I was just setting you up with that one.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.280
 Oh, right.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:15.920
 Sorry.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.440
 If you thought that wasn't exciting enough.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.480
 Yeah.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.160
 OK, Queen Victoria, higher or lower?

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:20.720
 Higher.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.960
 Higher, because they were huge, weren't they, Queen Victoria?

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.520
 Absolutely right.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.880
 It's not done on acreage, but yes, you're absolutely right.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.760
 They were bigger.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.280
 12,090 pounds.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.160
 OK, they were dead.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.200
 Right, Michael Jordan.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.160
 Next up.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:32.880
 Higher.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.760
 Lower.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.800
 James is right.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.200
 Michael Jordan's pants went for 2,400 quid in 2021.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.920
 Queen Victoria or Michael Jordan, come on, guys.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.280
 Greatest possible player of all time.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:41.920
 All right, all right, all right.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.600
 Queen Victoria, Queen of England.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.120
 Probably not that good at basketball,

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.560
 but good at lots of other things.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.680
 They thought it was going to be boring.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.880
 They're fighting over this now.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.960
 Elvis Presley.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.840
 Next.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.480
 Lower.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.440
 He never wore underwear.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.080
 Trick question.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:59.360
 He did wear them and they did not sell.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.840
 Can you believe that?

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.920
 They were up for auction and they didn't sell.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.440
 Are they the ones he pooed himself in?

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.800
 Because he did poo himself in.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.920
 Didn't he poo himself?

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.120
 Well, he died on the toilet.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:09.440
 Yeah.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.640
 Are they his death pants?

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.600
 No, I don't think...

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.480
 Because no one wants their death pants.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.760
 I don't think there is death pants,

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.840
 but they were a little marked, but they...

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.600
 Come on.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.320
 I said marked.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.280
 What do you want?

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.320
 They were macchiato.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.600
 Look, whichever way you want to phrase it,

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.240
 they were not pristine.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:26.640
 OK.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.000
 And that may have been the reason they didn't sell.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.360
 I doubt it.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:31.920
 Elvis fans.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.120
 Oh, skid marks from Elvis?

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.240
 They didn't sell.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.000
 Yeah, probably because they didn't meet the reserve price,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.200
 which would be higher.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:37.840
 Next question.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.040
 I've written Herman Goering,

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.280
 and I then didn't write down the price that they went for.

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.720
 You'd never have got that from Brucie.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.800
 Did you know who makes British Army bras?

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.240
 And...

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:52.720
 Ooh.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.720
 No, it's like a sort of...

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.840
 Victoria's Secret.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.560
 Marks and Spencer.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.240
 No.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.440
 Two ends of the spectrum.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:33:59.920
 Yeah.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.840
 Shows your different tastes, and that's fine.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.120
 Well, they only started being issued bras in 2021.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.120
 It's a booby-doo.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.800
 Booby-doo.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.440
 Booby-doo.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.680
 The company Booby-doo supplies the bras

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.880
 with the British Army now.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.120
 Wow.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.960
 I would have taken it as a while to get that, I reckon.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.760
 Yeah, it would.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.600
 And that is Anna.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.640
 My fact is that it takes two to four months

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:35.600
 to train a dog to keep still in an MRI scanner.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.840
 Yeah, I found this out recently.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.000
 I was just reading about a study that did some brain scans

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.200
 on 18 dogs, a whole range of dogs.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.480
 And I thought, well, I wonder how that works.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.120
 Because, you know, one of those people who bit in MRI scanners,

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.360
 lots of us probably have, and you have to keep pretty bloody still.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.320
 So I looked it up, and there's a study in 2018

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.720
 titled Clinical Findings in Dogs, Trained for Awake MRI.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.040
 And yeah, they've researched this properly.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.720
 And there's a specific trainer, actually,

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:09.040
 called Marta Gatchi, who described the process.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.720
 And it takes between five and 20 sessions without the scanner.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.960
 So before you're even entering the room with the scanner,

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.960
 you've got to get the dog used to keeping stills.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.200
 Is it easier to get them into a CAT scan?

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.800
 It's-- [LAUGHTER]

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.680
 No, you've become confused.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.480
 Now come on.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.720
 Yeah, so you introduce them to the scanner.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.040
 You can't food train them with treats,

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.520
 because you can't give a treat to a dog in a scanner,

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.560
 because that ruins the whole thing.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:35.520
 You have to start again.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.520
 They're not even allowed to lick their lips.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.320
 So they have to sit still for, what, like 10, 15 minutes.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.240
 And if a dog so much as drools--

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.080
 So this is why you can't food train them,

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.320
 because if a dog is waiting for a treat,

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.840
 they start to salivate.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.960
 And if they're in the MRI scanner and starting to salivate,

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.160
 then they start to dribble a bit,

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.000
 then they lick their lips, then they fucks it up,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.720
 and you don't get the crucial brain scan.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.640
 I'm not sure I could go 10 to 15 minutes without licking

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.320
 my lips, genuinely.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:00.880
 Yeah.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.160
 And I'm a very creepy guy.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.040
 So that's-- [LAUGHTER]

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.240
 But everyone's got their threshold.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.800
 I was going to say, do you know someone else who can't stay

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.640
 still in MRI scanners?

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.240
 And that is men.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:12.720
 Oh, really?

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.320
 Yeah, because when you look--

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.120
 when you put a man and a woman in an MRI scanner,

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.560
 the man will almost always move around more than the woman.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.440
 And that means that you're not getting correct readings

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.240
 from each person.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.400
 And it means that a lot of the studies that have been done

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.640
 between men and women in MRI scanners

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.280
 might not be 100% true, because the men are wiggling around

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.080
 so much.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:32.720
 OK.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.160
 And why are they wiggling?

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.280
 Because they're men.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:35.920
 What do you guys do?

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.320
 Why do men wiggle?

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.840
 They're probably adjusting themselves.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.120
 Yeah?

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.160
 Possible.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:40.720
 I don't know.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.000
 I'm in there licking my lips all the time.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.680
 The dog thing, they found out quite a lot of interesting stuff

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.400
 about dogs as a result of the ones they managed to get in there.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.280
 And one thing that they found out was that dogs really,

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.040
 genuinely love us as humans.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.520
 Like, they properly-- the bits of their brain

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.880
 that activate when bits of them are reminded of us

00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.600
 while they're in there.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.320
 So there's like, if aromas are brought in,

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.080
 if there's a human aroma that comes in,

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.960
 it activates this sort of reward center

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.440
 it's called, where it sort of shows that they're like,

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.320
 oh my god, it's my owner.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.360
 This is so exciting.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.240
 And that's a connection that we realize is a real thing now.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.280
 Because you always think, if a dog notices, for example,

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.200
 if you're feeling a bit moody, or you think,

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.840
 oh, the dog is picking up on my sympathy,

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.920
 it's not that it's just noticing and changing.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.240
 It's, look, it's genuinely concerned for you.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.760
 It can follow your emotions.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.360
 And that's what they were looking at.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.480
 And even if there was a group of aromas,

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.280
 they found that the dog would try and prioritize

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.160
 finding the human smell within that, just to be like,

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.120
 yeah, my owner's here, or a human I know is here.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.960
 How pathetic is it that--

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.400
 What a nice story you had, Dan.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.720
 We-- sorry, that's lovely, blah, blah, blah.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.200
 How pathetic is it that humans have gone to all the trouble

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.520
 of making this extraordinary machine

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.640
 just to absolutely make sure that dogs love us?

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.880
 The guys were all there, from them wagging their tails.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.240
 They were excited when we come home.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.360
 Let's just go, Trey.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.440
 I don't think that was the primary reason

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.800
 for the building of the MRI.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.000
 It was the most amazing thing I've ever done.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.440
 Just quickly, do you know that there are no--

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.120
 almost no guide dogs called Neil?

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.480
 Almost none.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.600
 I can't guarantee there are none,

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.800
 because I haven't really checked.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.520
 But, you know--

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.120
 Is that-- are there any called Fletch?

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.960
 Exactly.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.520
 This is why-- so probably not.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:23.920
 Yeah.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.560
 Because you can't-- you shouldn't name a guide dog

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.000
 after very common commands.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.840
 Or something that sounds like a very common command.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.360
 So Neil sounds like Heel.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.400
 Fletch sounds like Fetch.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.800
 Kit shouldn't be chosen, because it sounds like Sit.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.640
 So there are all sorts of names.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:36.880
 Anyway, that's what--

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.480
 Neil also sounds like Neil.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.000
 I don't know why you didn't go for that.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.960
 That's what I thought.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.080
 But then when you were saying that,

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.000
 I was thinking, did the dog's kneel down?

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:44.640
 Yeah, sure.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.120
 What is the-- what's the common dog command, saying Neil?

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.200
 Ah, remember-- I mean, I can't think of a--

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.480
 The root that you love me.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.440
 The root that you love me.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.320
 Kneel down now.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.640
 I can't think of dog specifically in this,

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.560
 but think of the opening scene of The Lion King

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.280
 when Simba's lift up, and they all go down to sort of--

00:38:59.280 --> 00:38:59.840
 Okay, again, again.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.400
 I'm sure--

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.400
 No, right. Simba is a fucking cat.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.120
 Not a dog.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.400
 No, I-- I--

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.840
 Well, to be fair, they're both mammals.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.480
 They are mammals.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.440
 I prefer that by saying,

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.040
 I'm not sure there were dogs in that scene.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.080
 I'm just saying, we do know they do it.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.920
 Animals, they do do it.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:16.880
 They do do it, and it has--

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.320
 But it's not a common dog.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.240
 It's like Fetch rollover.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.120
 That's it.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.600
 It has recently become quite popular for dogs

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.400
 to take the knee out of respect sometimes.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:26.880
 It has.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.400
 It was not way up to speak with it.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.360
 At football matches.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.520
 Those before crufts, before it starts,

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.960
 they all take the knee, don't they?

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.120
 Oh, my goodness.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.480
 Have you guys heard of the 20-inch high club?

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.000
 Certainly have.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.920
 Certainly have.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.880
 Go on.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.920
 The 20-inch high club is for people

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.160
 a very elite group of people,

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.000
 a small group who have had sex inside.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.360
 In the model-- in the model plane.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:55.840
 No, no.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.280
 No, in one of those planes,

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.680
 in a children's, like, shopping centre.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:06.480
 Pop another pound in there.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:12.240
 Elite.

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.240
 This elite club, of course.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.840
 It's a very small group of people

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.120
 who have had sex inside of an MRI scanner,

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.880
 and the reason it's called the 20-inch high club

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.400
 is because that's the height and space of the hole

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.440
 that you go into.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.360
 Grykey.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.320
 That the couple go into.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.080
 Those-- the initial people who first held that study,

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.960
 it was a scientist from the University of Groningen,

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.200
 actually.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.960
 We've played a game in Groningen, and it was--

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.640
 There was a lot of Groningen going on there.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:47.600
 Willie Broad Weimar Schultz was the scientist,

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.640
 and he scanned a couple.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.000
 But it was very hard to do.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.880
 It was very hard to get the couple to get the images

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.440
 they needed, because this was what you had to do.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.920
 You had to hold perfectly still for a complete minute.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.160
 And that's quite hard to do.

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.840
 The only couple who were able to do it

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.600
 were Amateur Street acrobats.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.960
 And so they had the experience and flexibility

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.680
 to-- Right.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.560
 --to get that right.

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.320
 To hold still during sex for a minute.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:10.800
 For a minute.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.000
 Please.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:19.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.240
 I've got to say, this podcast is going

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.440
 to be about 12 minutes long, when it goes out.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.040
 Shall we?

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:27.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.800
 There was-- no.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.840
 OK, can I tell you about one other study in this--

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.760
 There was a--

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.720
 Why not?

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.000
 Kate Sukel, she was called.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.920
 She was writing a book about science and sex,

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.120
 and she had to--

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.560
 the study that was being done on her,

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.640
 she had to have an orgasm inside an MRI machine.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.400
 But, you know, by herself.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.440
 And but, as Anna and Dan have said,

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.520
 the thing is you have to be very still

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.880
 inside the MRI machine.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.680
 And it's very hard.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.120
 And so like training the dogs to be incredibly still,

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.640
 she had to train herself.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.760
 And this was the mechanism.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.280
 She wrote an article in The Guardian all about it.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.360
 Amazing account.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.440
 She said she wasn't quite sure she could manage

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.080
 to get all the way there under those incredibly still

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.360
 circumstances, because she was--

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.920
 she had to be in a helmet, which was screwed to the bed.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.040
 So incredibly still.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.280
 But she managed it.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.160
 She managed the training program by attaching a small bell,

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.520
 which belonged to her cat,

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.760
 to her forehead with some duct tape,

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.600
 and then practiced getting there

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.200
 with the minimum jingling possible.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.640
 What?

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.400
 So she strapped--

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.240
 She strapped her cat's bell to her forehead with duct tape.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.120
 Yeah, yeah, I got that bit.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:31.360
 Yeah.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.040
 And then practiced having an orgasm

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.640
 without hearing the bell go once.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.040
 Oh.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.640
 To stay still so that she then stays still.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.240
 That was the practicing before she came in.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:38.800
 Before she went into the machine, yeah.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.720
 She wasn't turned on by cat bells.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.120
 I mean, by the end of this process,

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.080
 she probably was.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.880
 OK, wow, that's amazing.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.840
 Have you guys heard of Dr. Didge?

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.440
 No.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.840
 This is a guy called Graham Wiggins,

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.440
 and he helped to develop the technology for MRI scanners.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.880
 OK, so without him,

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.840
 we wouldn't have all of the really sharp images

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.640
 that we have today.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.000
 And most of his Wikipedia page

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.400
 is down to a type of didgeridoo

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.760
 that he invented, which has got keys in it.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.120
 OK, he invented it out of cardboard wrapping paper tube,

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.280
 and he only made one of them.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.000
 He used it for one gig, and it fell apart.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.880
 But then he later on played with the Grateful Dead

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.960
 playing the didgeridoo.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.360
 Cool.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.120
 He's like an amazing didgeridoo player,

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.040
 but he also was one of the main people

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.640
 behind inventing the MRI scanner.

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.240
 You can definitely see the relationship

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.840
 between a didgeridoo and an MRI scanner.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.120
 You just hope that the MRI scanner

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.800
 doesn't fall apart after one goes.

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.240
 Because of the noise that it makes.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.160
 Because you go in a big tube and there's a big noise.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.080
 Big horrible sound.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.440
 You know fMRI scanners,

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.920
 so that's a functional MRI scanner.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.120
 It's there for your brain.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.880
 But you can also get a non-functional MRI scanner.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.960
 There's one of these at the University of Michigan.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.200
 And what the point of this is,

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.080
 is you go in and it doesn't do anything it's supposed to do,

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.440
 but it makes all the noises that an MRI scanner makes.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.200
 So it kind of makes an MRI scanner,

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.000
 if you've ever been in one.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.360
 It makes this really kind of,

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.360
 it's the magnets are really, really strong.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.960
 And it's like this banging.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.760
 And all this really, really loud noise.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.560
 That's a didgeridoo.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:21.360
 And people feel like they can sometimes,

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.000
 some people actually can make out a tune.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.480
 Like their brain turns this really weird noise

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.440
 into a kind of tune.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:27.920
 Oh, cool.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.200
 And if you want to study that,

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.400
 you can't just put loads of people in an MRI scanner

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.000
 because there's too much, you know,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.520
 electromagnetism and stuff.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.760
 And so they need to put them in this fake MRI scanner,

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.960
 which has all the noises,

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.800
 and you can see what's going on with people.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:41.280
 Wow.

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.080
 Wait, but if it's fake,

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.440
 then you can't see what's going on in their brains

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.800
 because it's fake, right?

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:45.840
 Yeah, so it's more experienced.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.120
 They're not looking at their brains.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.160
 It's the experience side.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.120
 I see, okay.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:49.840
 That's the other thing.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:54.080
 You know the ASMR that people report about having?

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.760
 So that's the idea that if you watch a video on YouTube

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.040
 of someone ironing,

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.880
 it gives you a sort of brain fuzz,

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.480
 like goosebumps around your head.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:06.400
 It's any noise that's, or some people say,

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.360
 "I'm whispering now, and I'm rubbing the cloth

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.480
 between my fingers."

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.200
 And that kind of...

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.160
 Some people listen in,

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.680
 so they're like, "Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!"

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:17.920
 But so that's an interesting thing.

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:18.560
 It's very sensitive.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.240
 It gives some people a really, yeah.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.040
 Exactly, yeah.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.040
 And they're trying to work out

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.400
 what it is in the brain that does that.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.640
 So obviously an MRI scanner is the way to find that out.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.960
 Unfortunately, it's too noisy in there

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.920
 to even begin that

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.520
 because it just breaks the spell of it.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.520
 So we can't work out what it is yet.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.920
 Shit, what a terrible loss to medicine

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.920
 that we'll never know why people get turned on

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.920
 by weirdos whispering to them on YouTube.

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.880
 Fuck.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.560
 I guess we'll just have to keep curing cancer.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:48.560
 Guys, I'm going to have to wrap us up.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.120
 I know, okay.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.800
 Yeah, we're out of time.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:51.680
 Okay, that's it.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:52.800
 That is all of our facts.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.400
