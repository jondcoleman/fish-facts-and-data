1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,060
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,220
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,540
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

5
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,700
 from Up the Creek in Greenwich, London.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,700
 (audience cheering)

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,500
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,100
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,020
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,180
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones,

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,120
 but not with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,620
 but with some of our favorite facts from the last 12 months.

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,760
 This is No Such Thing as the news meets the book of the year

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,900
 that we didn't get to do,

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,100
 all smashed into a 30 minute podcast.

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,420
 So, in no particular order, here we go,

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,480
 starting with a fact.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,400
 (laughing)

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,620
 - How's the jump in?

20
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,980
 - I can jump in because we're recording this

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,980
 at the same time as the World Cup semi-final is happening

22
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,580
 between France and Morocco.

23
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,060
 And I have a fact where 40,000 people in France

24
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,380
 thought they were watching a World Cup match,

25
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,660
 Germany versus Japan on YouTube,

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,000
 but they were actually watching someone playing FIFA 23.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,260
 (laughing)

28
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,000
 And apparently this is a group of people in Vietnam,

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,060
 this is what they do.

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,560
 They play FIFA, they pixelate it

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,080
 so that someone watching the game

32
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,400
 thinks that maybe they're watching

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,040
 a pixelated version of the actual match.

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,920
 And they make hundreds and hundreds of pounds

35
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,760
 by just getting people to watch.

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,600
 - Oh, 'cause people are, right, right,

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,640
 'cause they add money or whatever, wow.

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,840
 - That's the thing, they're genuinely,

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,480
 I read this too, and it's amazing.

40
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,280
 And what a letdown when you find out that it's not,

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,200
 and how foolish you are.

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,920
 I saw some pictures of the pixelated

43
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,480
 and it does kind of look right,

44
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,920
 but when they clean it up, it's very much a video game.

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,760
 - Really?

46
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,680
 - Oh yeah, I mean, it is a video game.

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,740
 But I thought, I haven't played FIFA almost ever.

48
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,900
 So I assumed it's like, could we do that

49
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,100
 with the podcast?

50
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,980
 Like if we sort of play a kind of slightly garbled version.

51
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,180
 So it's like, there it is, there it is, like that.

52
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,020
 - Yeah.

53
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,860
 - People might listen to that.

54
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,420
 - Does that mean there are people out there

55
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,580
 who might think that, like, Wales won the World Cup?

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,700
 - Oh yeah, 'cause you could totally rig it.

57
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,020
 - Apparently they're not that gullible, it says.

58
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,540
 (laughing)

59
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,220
 Sorry, sorry.

60
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,500
 - But they did, that's James who was pointing out,

61
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,080
 they matched up the right match.

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,260
 So everything was fine.

63
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,560
 The thing that was the kicker

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,680
 was it was a Vietnamese commentary, as you say.

65
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,080
 And that's, but I don't think I would have noticed.

66
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,280
 - But actually, that added sort of realism to it.

67
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,120
 - Yeah.

68
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,960
 - 'Cause when you go onto YouTube

69
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,200
 and you're watching some hucky channel,

70
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,640
 it might be in a different language.

71
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,360
 So it kind of gave realism to it.

72
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,120
 - Yeah, but another news story from the year,

73
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,800
 the queen, queen died.

74
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,640
 - Oh.

75
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,480
 - What?

76
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,900
 - Oh wow, way to bring her down on it.

77
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,960
 - So just to cheer us all up,

78
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,260
 let's remember the greatest tribute paid to Her Majesty,

79
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,320
 which was by the London tourist attraction,

80
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,660
 Shrek's Adventure.

81
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,260
 Do you guys remember this?

82
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,740
 A lot of companies jumped on the bandwagon.

83
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,300
 Domino's Pizza said everyone at Domino's

84
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,220
 joins the nation and the world in mourning.

85
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,020
 Pizza Express went for a slightly different message,

86
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,100
 but they also said the same kind of thing.

87
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,840
 And Shrek's Adventure London said,

88
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,820
 "Shrek's Adventure London joins millions of mourners

89
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,380
 "around the UK and world in paying tribute to HM QE2."

90
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,220
 Yeah.

91
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,600
 - I went to Shrek's Adventure this year.

92
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,380
 I thought you guys thought you went to see the queen.

93
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,060
 - Oh no, the queue was shorted by just a bit

94
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,860
 at the Shrek Adventure on the South Bank of London.

95
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,700
 - Wow.

96
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,380
 - Actually, I remember a few weeks ago,

97
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,060
 I never used this on the podcast,

98
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,140
 but I found out that the longest ever theme park ride

99
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,060
 was eight hours long.

100
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,220
 So you could have done that ride three times

101
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,620
 in the time you'd have got to see the queen.

102
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,460
 - Really, what was it?

103
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,300
 What was the ride?

104
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,420
 - It was the Hogwarts one at Universal in America.

105
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,980
 - There's an eight hour long Hogwarts ride.

106
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,420
 - It was when it first opened.

107
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,300
 - What was like a broken motor or something?

108
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,360
 Like what was the, why was it eight hours long?

109
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,480
 - Everyone wanted to go there.

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,920
 - Sorry, the queue was eight hours long.

111
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,560
 Sorry.

112
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,400
 You said the ride.

113
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
 You said the ride was eight hours long.

114
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,280
 - You said you could go on it three times.

115
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,880
 - Well, let's see if I said that by the time

116
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,180
 the edit goes out, shall we?

117
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,120
 (audience laughing)

118
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,640
 - Not knowing it was an eight hour ride when it got on.

119
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,840
 (audience laughing)

120
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,680
 - Ah.

121
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,520
 - Sorry, I'm the queen.

122
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,360
 - The queeny thing, yeah.

123
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,100
 - So, you know, so you remember for the day

124
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,060
 of the funeral itself, the queen's coffin

125
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,660
 was carried on a gun carriage, you know,

126
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,540
 that was the thing, and it was pulled

127
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,460
 by lots of naval ratings, that was the thing,

128
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,060
 hundreds of them all pulling it in front and behind

129
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,340
 to get it exactly the right speed.

130
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,680
 So that carriage, this is just an interesting thing.

131
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,060
 That carriage has been kept in a sort of storage room.

132
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,420
 That's not the interesting bit.

133
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,700
 (audience laughing)

134
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,420
 It's been kept there for 40 years,

135
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,380
 and every single week its wheels have been oiled

136
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,820
 and turned around one quarter, just in case gravity

137
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,240
 affected and misshaped the wheels,

138
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,720
 and then they wouldn't work properly

139
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,880
 on the day of the funeral.

140
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,200
 - But 'cause, I mean, gravity doesn't do that.

141
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,160
 We've got other wheels in the world, haven't we?

142
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,000
 (audience laughing)

143
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,360
 And we don't turn them a quarter, I think.

144
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,080
 - Yeah, it's not like I come back to my car

145
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,320
 after I haven't driven it for a month

146
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,360
 and they're all square.

147
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,440
 (audience laughing)

148
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,080
 - What's gravity doing to it, sorry?

149
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,280
 - It's just, well, it's making it flat.

150
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,960
 - It's a heavy carriage, it weighs tons, you know.

151
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,800
 - I get that, yeah.

152
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,100
 - Yeah, yeah, and the wheels are obviously quite sensitive,

153
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,440
 and you just want to, you just--

154
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,500
 - So what, by shifting your wheel,

155
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,720
 that's effectively an anti-gravity machine.

156
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,060
 - It's not anti-gravity.

157
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,460
 - No, 'cause you even out the effect of gravity over here.

158
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,460
 - If you flatten out this bit,

159
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,580
 if you shift it round a quarter turn,

160
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,580
 you flatten out that bit, and then you flatten out that.

161
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,620
 But it's like doing something culinary,

162
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,300
 like dough or something.

163
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,740
 There's a culinary metaphor in there,

164
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,460
 which if I cooks, I'd be able to give you right now.

165
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,460
 - Right.

166
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,780
 Domino's pizza actually had--

167
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,820
 (audience laughing)

168
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,660
 - In anticipation.

169
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,160
 - I just think that's an interesting example

170
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,480
 of the extreme thought and preparation

171
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,720
 that had gone into it over decades, you know?

172
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,240
 - You were talking about the different things

173
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,960
 that different brands did.

174
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,960
 So Morrison's, apparently, it was said

175
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,240
 that they turned off the beeps in their checkouts

176
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,480
 in deference to the Queen dyeing.

177
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,320
 But they denied it, and they said

178
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,000
 they merely turned down the sound.

179
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,840
 - Oh, okay.

180
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,660
 - So instead of going, "beep," it went, "beep."

181
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,760
 (audience laughing)

182
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,000
 Although for someone who's dyeing, going, "beep,"

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
 "beep," "beep," you don't really want that, do you?

184
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,840
 - They should have replaced it with the Big Ben Bongs.

185
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,800
 That would have been nice.

186
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
 - That would have been great.

187
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

188
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,720
 - Bong.

189
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,400
 (audience laughing)

190
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,960
 - She caused confusion as a result of her death in Canada.

191
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,720
 Don't know if you saw this, but in Canada,

192
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,440
 there was not long after she died, like quite soon,

193
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,280
 there was a citizen ceremony going on

194
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,800
 where there were anointing new citizens of Canada

195
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
 and doing the pledge and so on.

196
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,720
 And it was all done virtually,

197
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,680
 and there was 140 people there or so.

198
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,320
 And they started doing the ceremony,

199
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,360
 and they had to stop it and say,

200
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,920
 "Sorry, we can't make you Canadians.

201
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,400
 "We don't know who you're pledging to.

202
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,040
 "Is it the Queen or is it to the King Charles?

203
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,120
 "So they had to like go off and find out

204
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,960
 "who the fuck's in charge."

205
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,280
 - Does that mean it doesn't count?

206
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,160
 If they said the Queen instead of the King,

207
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,000
 it doesn't count?

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,960
 - I think so, yeah.

209
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,560
 - Really, 'cause quite a lot of the England team

210
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,040
 in the World Cup matches would sing

211
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,760
 "God Save the Queen" instead of "God Save the King."

212
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,520
 So do you think we could get a rematch against them?

213
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,120
 (audience laughing)

214
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,760
 - Hey, here's a crazy stat that I read,

215
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,440
 is that the Queen was,

216
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,360
 she was obviously very old,

217
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,320
 but was she 96 years old when she passed.

218
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,360
 So that means that of all the people alive in the country,

219
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,680
 only 100,000 people had been around longer than her.

220
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,920
 So everyone else of us had her in our lives.

221
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,320
 - That's still quite a lot, I think.

222
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,240
 - 100,000?

223
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,080
 I can't believe 100,000 people are older than 96.

224
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,920
 - Yeah, it's filled a lot.

225
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,240
 - Okay, it's gone the wrong way.

226
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,000
 (audience laughing)

227
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,120
 - You just needed to present that with a different term.

228
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
 - Yeah, sorry.

229
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,360
 - 100,000 people have been around longer than the Queen.

230
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,520
 - Wow, that's a great fact.

231
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,360
 - Oh, great fact.

232
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,240
 (audience laughing)

233
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,280
 - And that will make the edit.

234
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,320
 - That will make the edit.

235
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,120
 (audience laughing)

236
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,400
 - Just on royals, we're not the only royal family

237
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,440
 in the world, obviously the Saudi Arabian royal family

238
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,520
 forgave Thailand this year for a really interesting thing.

239
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,720
 I had no idea they'd been having this feud for 30 years,

240
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
 but like there haven't been any flights

241
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,000
 from Saudi Arabia to Thailand for 30 years.

242
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,160
 There have been no ambassadors, anything like that.

243
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,800
 And it was caused because 30 years ago,

244
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,560
 a Thai cleaner who was employed as a servant

245
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,720
 at the Royal Palace, the Saudi Arabian Royal Palace,

246
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,120
 he was called Krankrai Tekhamon.

247
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,400
 He stole $20 million worth of gems, and diamonds,

248
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,320
 and precious stones. - Wow.

249
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,760
 - Hid them in some vacuum cleaner bags,

250
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,360
 'cause you use what you've got,

251
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,040
 and like duct tape them to himself.

252
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,840
 - Oh, he didn't accidentally suck them up,

253
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,680
 and then... (audience laughing)

254
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,720
 - That may have been his excuse in court, I don't know.

255
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,920
 And he smuggled them out of the country,

256
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,800
 and I love this, the way he smuggled them out was,

257
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,240
 he got them to Thailand by putting them

258
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,400
 in a big box of cargo, and then he knew

259
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,920
 that the Thai officials at the other end

260
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,280
 would check them at customs, unless he did something.

261
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,040
 So he bribed them with an envelope,

262
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,520
 stuffed with some cash, and with a note saying,

263
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,160
 "Hey, in my cargo, I've got loads of really bad porn,

264
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,200
 and I'd really rather you didn't search it,

265
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,760
 'cause that would be really awkward for me,

266
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,840
 so can you not?"

267
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,680
 And they didn't.

268
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,440
 - I really... - I would have thought

269
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,880
 you'd go for something slightly less tempting

270
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,440
 than that wouldn't you?

271
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,080
 - You're right, they're very respectful,

272
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,840
 the Thai officials at customs.

273
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,120
 Anyway, this year, finally, Saudi Arabia forgave Thailand,

274
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,080
 'cause it became this huge diplomatic incident,

275
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,400
 people were shot dead because of it.

276
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,200
 - Yeah, there were lots of back and forth, yeah.

277
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,600
 - Yeah, that's terrible.

278
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,000
 - But the blue diamond's still missing,

279
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,520
 so check under your seats before you go.

280
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,360
 - It's not Oprah, we're not Oprah.

281
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
 (audience laughing)

282
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,440
 - Just while we're talking about porn,

283
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,400
 even though it was just a word,

284
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,280
 I'm just gonna quickly grab that

285
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,120
 and bring it over here.

286
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
 There was a news story which in Manhattan,

287
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,240
 a congressional candidate called Mike Itkis,

288
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,040
 he's running and he has a sex positive approach

289
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,480
 as part of his campaign.

290
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,760
 So he thought, "I'd like to demonstrate

291
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,560
 how positive I am about sex."

292
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
 He released a 13 minute long porn video with himself

293
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,120
 and a porn star that he filmed and put out

294
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,280
 to say, "I'm a man of my words."

295
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,000
 That's called Bucket List Bonanza

296
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,280
 and it's with Nicole Sage, the porn star.

297
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,160
 And yeah.

298
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,640
 - Sorry, what party is he from?

299
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,920
 - I would say wherever he is,

300
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,360
 there's a bit of a party going on there.

301
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,440
 There was someone called Alexandra Hunt

302
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,600
 who ran in the third district for Congress

303
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,880
 and she was a former exotic dancer.

304
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,560
 But rather than hiding it, she decided to embrace it

305
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,360
 and one of her campaign slogans was just elect hose.

306
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,720
 The other one said, "I may have danced for money,

307
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,560
 but I'm no corporate whore."

308
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,240
 - Wow. - Isn't that good, isn't it?

309
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,480
 - Yeah, it's quite good, yeah.

310
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,160
 - There was a guy in Nebraska, Bruce Bostleman,

311
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,720
 who apologized for repeating the rumour

312
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,640
 that schools are accommodating children

313
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,800
 who self-identify as cats

314
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,520
 by putting litter trays in the corner of the classroom.

315
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,960
 - Why are they putting litter trays in the corner?

316
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,080
 - Oh, no, they're not.

317
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,360
 - All right, okay.

318
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,800
 So the premise of his accusation is flawed.

319
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,960
 - Yes, he accused them of doing something

320
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,280
 that definitely did not happen.

321
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,120
 - Right.

322
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,080
 - I've got a fact that was sent in by someone, actually,

323
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,320
 like a couple of weeks ago.

324
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,440
 Someone called Brain Blobs on Twitter,

325
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,120
 so thank you, Brain Blobs.

326
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,280
 This is a really thrilling thing, guys,

327
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,760
 so this doesn't sound thrilling,

328
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,320
 but there's been a general conference

329
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,360
 on weights and measures and some scientists,

330
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,040
 no, stay with it, because some scientists

331
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,200
 from the National Physical Laboratory in the UK

332
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,320
 attended that conference on weights and measures.

333
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,040
 And obviously, I don't need to tell you

334
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,400
 that that's the authority of the International Bureau

335
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,800
 of Weights and Measures.

336
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,480
 And so, anyway, we've got some new units to celebrate,

337
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,320
 and that's really good.

338
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,840
 So a measure of weight, a ronogram.

339
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,880
 A ronogram is...

340
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,440
 - It sounds like it's someone's birthday.

341
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,280
 (laughter)

342
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,720
 And you just send someone a run-around.

343
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,560
 - Hello.

344
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,400
 - What is it?

345
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,240
 - A run.

346
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,560
 Happy birthday.

347
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,800
 - Oh, that's so much better than what I've got here.

348
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,720
 (laughter)

349
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,120
 So a ronogram is a one followed by 20 zeros, okay?

350
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,440
 And I think the earth weighs six ronograms,

351
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,280
 which is really good,

352
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,640
 'cause previously we had to say it weighs

353
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,640
 like 250 million blars,

354
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,680
 and even that was the previous biggest unit.

355
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,520
 - Okay.

356
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,360
 - So you see what I mean?

357
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,600
 Now we can just say it's six ronograms,

358
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,400
 and that's a much more convenient way of putting it.

359
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,240
 - Great.

360
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,080
 - Yeah, that's good.

361
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,920
 - That's very handy.

362
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,680
 Yeah, 'cause people often ask how much is the earth weigh,

363
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,040
 and you don't know any more units.

364
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,480
 - Well, there's the ronometer.

365
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,320
 - Oh, yeah.

366
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,160
 - And the universe is--

367
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,560
 - It's how you measure runs, isn't it?

368
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,760
 (laughter)

369
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,720
 - The entire universe is just one ronometer across.

370
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,560
 - What?

371
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,400
 - Oh, that's great.

372
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,240
 - 'Cause it's very big, it's huge.

373
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,080
 - You sound surprised,

374
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,560
 but you haven't just heard that a ronogram is a large thing.

375
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,400
 - It's massive.

376
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
 - It's bigger than a gram.

377
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,960
 - But I don't think that then helps you understand--

378
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,800
 - Okay.

379
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,640
 - Anything.

380
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,480
 - All right, Dan, okay, Dan.

381
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,440
 No, no, no, that's fair enough.

382
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,480
 All right, it's fair enough.

383
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,960
 - Correct me if I'm wrong, it's an expanding universe.

384
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,480
 - Well, eventually it'll be two ronometers.

385
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,880
 - Okay, here's, okay, better example, better example.

386
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,800
 The other end of the scale,

387
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,920
 they've added some very, very small things as well.

388
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,760
 - Yeah.

389
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,400
 - Right, so what about a quectogram?

390
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,240
 Okay?

391
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,080
 - Okay.

392
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,200
 - There's a rontogram, which is the weight of an electron.

393
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,120
 - Oh, this'll be the weight of a quark or something like that.

394
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,360
 - Is the weight of something even,

395
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,200
 so the weight added to your phone

396
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,520
 if you get one extra byte of data on your phone.

397
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,360
 - Oh, okay, right.

398
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,560
 - That is one quectogram.

399
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,840
 - Right, so that has actual weight?

400
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,680
 - Yeah.

401
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,440
 - I swear to God, I emptied my phone

402
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,760
 some hours the other day, and...

403
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,400
 (audience laughing)

404
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,640
 - And it floated away.

405
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,560
 - I'm not kidding, it felt so much lighter.

406
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,760
 I was like, wow.

407
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,600
 - Yeah.

408
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,440
 - And so that's true.

409
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,280
 - That's it, yeah, that's it.

410
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,120
 - There we go, yeah.

411
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,560
 - Do we think any of these are gonna come in handy

412
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,920
 at Weight Witchers' Meetings?

413
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,120
 (audience laughing)

414
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,200
 - Maybe, yeah.

415
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,520
 - You've lost a rontogram this week, that really is, wow.

416
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,200
 Well, actually on the Earth, an universe,

417
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,720
 worrying news this year is that our days are getting longer

418
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,000
 and we don't really know why.

419
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,320
 So there's this quite confusing thing

420
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,800
 where in the very, very long term,

421
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,720
 the days are getting slightly longer

422
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,080
 'cause the Earth's rotation is slowing

423
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,880
 'cause the moon's moving away from us.

424
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,240
 That's over millions of years.

425
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,280
 You don't need to worry about that.

426
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,600
 But in the short term, like the last 50 years,

427
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
 weirdly counterbalancing that,

428
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,200
 they've been getting shorter,

429
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,440
 which we haven't really known why.

430
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,000
 And now suddenly, the last couple of years,

431
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,840
 they've gradually started getting longer,

432
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,200
 don't know if anyone's noticed here.

433
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,040
 The extra--

434
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,080
 - It's felt like during Andy's tiny bit, actually.

435
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,080
 (audience laughing)

436
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,520
 - So there's a new measure of time,

437
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,720
 the Andy Graham is, before.

438
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,160
 - It's only a matter of minutes, but you will age.

439
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,960
 (audience laughing)

440
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,120
 - But yeah, we think it might be

441
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,960
 because of the Chandler wobble.

442
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,440
 (laughing)

443
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,280
 - The Chandler wobble.

444
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,880
 - Could that be any more weird?

445
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,440
 (audience laughing)

446
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,800
 - Lovely, for someone who I know

447
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,320
 has never seen an episode of Friends.

448
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,760
 (audience laughing)

449
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,640
 - Someone who's read the Wikipedia page of Friends.

450
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,600
 (audience laughing)

451
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,960
 - Halfway through, I was thinking I'm out of my depth here.

452
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,960
 (audience laughing)

453
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,840
 - Oh, you nailed it.

454
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,420
 (upbeat music)

455
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:17,160
 - Do you know whose time on Earth has been made longer

456
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,640
 by one to two years, as of six months from now?

457
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,840
 - Oh, yes, I think, I mean,

458
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,520
 despite the way you phrase that, yeah.

459
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,360
 (audience laughing)

460
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,520
 I think I actually do.

461
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,920
 - So it's South Koreans.

462
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,760
 - Right.

463
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,760
 - South Koreans have just extended their life

464
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,160
 by one to two years,

465
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,960
 and that's gonna happen between June of next year

466
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,560
 because they usually, in South Korea,

467
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,600
 the way that they measure your age is when you're born,

468
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,240
 you were born one years old.

469
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,640
 So they say that nine months is rounded up to

470
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,840
 12 months, you are one, and if you're born,

471
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,480
 I think it's like close to December,

472
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,360
 then you become two because it just is a new year.

473
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,480
 So you go, you're two, quite quickly,

474
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,760
 if you're born in, let's say, November.

475
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,320
 So that's been a thing where people have always found

476
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,640
 confusing if they go overseas,

477
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,840
 because their birth certificate or the passports,

478
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,400
 we all carry our birth certificates, right?

479
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,240
 (audience laughing)

480
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,280
 Their passport will say an age,

481
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,840
 but they'll say a different age,

482
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,880
 and it's really confusing.

483
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,960
 So now South Korea has decided to abandon

484
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,480
 the whole thing of saying you're one or two when you're born,

485
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,800
 and they're gonna be like the rest of the world's metric

486
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,640
 or I guess the majority.

487
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,480
 - Are they?

488
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,320
 - Yeah, it's really sad.

489
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,160
 It's a real shame.

490
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,000
 - That's so sad.

491
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,120
 - Well, I just think it's a cool, interesting thing to do.

492
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,600
 - Yeah, it's an interesting cultural difference.

493
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,760
 Yeah, don't do it, Korea.

494
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,600
 Go back.

495
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,640
 'Cause it would be cool if, as you claimed,

496
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,600
 they're adding two years to their life,

497
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,360
 and if that's how they've tricked them into it, then yeah.

498
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,840
 - Oh, I think if I could, I'm 38,

499
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,120
 if I could be like, I'm now 36,

500
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,040
 I think that would make my day.

501
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,960
 You wouldn't be, you would have--

502
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,480
 - You're still gonna die on the same day.

503
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,320
 - Yeah.

504
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,000
 (laughter)

505
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,840
 - Well, yeah, but--

506
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,160
 - And it's soon, sooner than you think.

507
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,760
 - But I will have died two years younger.

508
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,760
 - Also, people, more people will say, "Such a shame."

509
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,600
 - Yeah, yeah.

510
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,880
 - They were too soon.

511
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,200
 - There were only 100,000 people older than Dan Shriver.

512
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,920
 (laughter)

513
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,680
 - Can I drag us quickly back to sport?

514
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,520
 - Oh, yeah.

515
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,360
 - Oh, yeah.

516
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,280
 - And well, actually, one thing I just wanted to say

517
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,240
 about Southgate, which, go with Southgate.

518
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,760
 - Sorry, yes, I'm not familiar.

519
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,600
 I'd like to know a little bit.

520
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,440
 - You were thinking the Tube station, weren't you?

521
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,840
 - I was actually thinking a scandal.

522
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,680
 (laughter)

523
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,500
 - Southgate.

524
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,640
 - Did you hear about Southgate?

525
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,400
 - So, football manager for England.

526
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,440
 - England's football manager,

527
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,160
 and everyone thinks he's a really great guy now,

528
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,040
 so obviously he was the bad guy in the '90s

529
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,400
 because for international listeners,

530
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,240
 he missed a penalty at the Euros,

531
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,680
 bit of a crisis for his popularity.

532
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,560
 Everyone loves him now 'cause he wears waistcoats

533
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,160
 and England's a quite good team,

534
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,200
 but I found out how he met his wife,

535
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,560
 I mean, his ropey.

536
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,080
 - Oh, what do you mean with ropes?

537
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,560
 (laughter)

538
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,120
 - It's actually not that bad,

539
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,640
 but he saw a woman he fancied who worked in a shop in Croydon,

540
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,000
 and so he, first of all, would like,

541
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,840
 loiter around the shop pretending he was looking

542
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,680
 at the clothes there a lot to try and talk to her.

543
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,520
 - What sort of shop?

544
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,360
 - Clothes shop, I reckon.

545
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,200
 - Oh, yeah.

546
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,440
 (laughter)

547
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,720
 - A hardware store, he gets picked up.

548
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,360
 He's picking up padlocks and going,

549
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,200
 "I love this t-shirt."

550
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,000
 - "I love this high-vis jacket."

551
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,640
 (laughter)

552
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,040
 - Okay, sorry, so he's hanging around the shop.

553
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,880
 - He's hanging around the shop.

554
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,320
 He finds out she's got a very serious live-in boyfriend,

555
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,080
 but it happens, he goes to a restaurant one day

556
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,680
 and her and her boyfriend are sitting nearby at the table,

557
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,920
 and he senses that they're having a bad time together.

558
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,720
 He senses this relationship on the rocks,

559
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,400
 so when the boyfriend's not looking,

560
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,920
 he sneaks over to her and drops a letter in her hand

561
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,760
 with his number on it.

562
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,600
 - A letter?

563
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,760
 - A full review, yeah, yeah, 18 pages.

564
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,120
 A note, I suppose a note,

565
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,880
 and saying, you know, when this cocks up,

566
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,040
 which clearly it's going to,

567
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,520
 why don't you give me a call?

568
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,360
 And she did.

569
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,200
 - And she did.

570
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,800
 - And they had their dates in Tesco Carpac for a long time,

571
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,440
 'cause they had to be secret, I think.

572
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,640
 - Oh, so she hadn't left,

573
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,080
 they just started dating secretly?

574
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,960
 - Yeah, yeah.

575
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,760
 - Wow, this is a gossipy story, isn't it?

576
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,960
 (laughter)

577
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,840
 - A Tesco Carpac is not a very secret place, either.

578
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,560
 It's actually open to anyone who wants to go there.

579
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,960
 - I assume her boyfriend shopped at Sainsbury's.

580
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess so, yeah.

581
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,000
 - It's the only safe place for them.

582
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,080
 Anyway, so that is some hot goss from 30 years ago.

583
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,920
 - 30 years.

584
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,920
 - About Gagasasky.

585
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,320
 - Are they still together?

586
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,800
 - Yeah, the art's very sweet, actually.

587
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
 - Oh, that's nice, well done, Gareth.

588
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,520
 I got sports news here as well.

589
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,560
 This is to do with the world of Badminton.

590
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,400
 You'll all know this, I'm sure.

591
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,440
 But just to remind you, four Chinese Badminton players

592
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,480
 were put on probation for two years this year

593
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,680
 after failing to try their best to win in 2018.

594
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,600
 So the match happened in 2018, they finally had the thing.

595
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,320
 Basically, the people that were watching the match

596
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,840
 noticed that either side were sort of not really giving it,

597
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,600
 they were just sort of like dicking about,

598
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,880
 and that apparently is illegal in Badminton.

599
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,160
 - They did it for a very good strategic reason, right?

600
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,000
 - What, both sides?

601
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,840
 - Yeah.

602
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,680
 - Is it so they can play a different team

603
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,520
 in the next round?

604
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,480
 - Yeah, exactly.

605
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,320
 - I thought you were gonna say

606
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,000
 maybe they'd been paid to throw the match.

607
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,600
 - No, I think it was because they,

608
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,440
 if whoever won would be playing the better team,

609
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,080
 and I believe it was two Chinese team, wasn't it?

610
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,280
 Who, if they won,

611
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,880
 were gonna end up playing the other Chinese team.

612
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,480
 And so that was silly, 'cause they want China to win.

613
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,480
 So it's pointless China playing China,

614
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,800
 'cause they're gonna knock one of them out.

615
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,920
 - Right. - And so they all won,

616
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,560
 and then I think was the other one Korean.

617
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,960
 - I don't know, apparently you know this way better than me.

618
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,800
 - I'm just guessing.

619
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,480
 I'm just like crystal ball.

620
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,880
 Yeah, I think then the other team were like,

621
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,440
 hang on, you're trying to lose.

622
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,960
 We're gonna try and lose as well.

623
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,240
 And then they got picked up,

624
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,320
 and then the second half they kind of went for it properly,

625
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,320
 'cause I think they realized we've been caught out.

626
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,720
 - But now they're banned, yeah, for playing shit.

627
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,560
 (laughing)

628
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,680
 Which is amazing.

629
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,440
 - In 2024, the Olympics are gonna be in Paris.

630
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,040
 This is the fact about next year, I should say.

631
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,040
 Because this year they unveiled the mascot

632
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,080
 they're gonna have.

633
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,840
 And everyone said the same thing,

634
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,040
 that it looks rather like a clitoris.

635
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,600
 - Oh.

636
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,000
 - The woman who designed it, when they said to her,

637
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,120
 you know, it's a bit weird

638
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,040
 that your mascot looks like a clitoris.

639
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,240
 She said, "I'm so happy after everything

640
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,840
 "that's happened with feminism,

641
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,520
 "that people can now recognize the clitoris."

642
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,760
 (laughing)

643
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,160
 - I saw the mascot, I didn't think it looked like,

644
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,640
 (laughing)

645
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,480
 I don't think at all.

646
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,560
 - And they did find, I'm sure everyone saw this today,

647
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,800
 they found the snakes clitoris for the first time, haven't they?

648
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,640
 - Yeah.

649
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,480
 - It's got two.

650
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,320
 - It's got two.

651
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,160
 - Two.

652
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,320
 - Yeah, 'cause they have hemi-penis, don't they,

653
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,480
 like, double penises, so they have double clitorises as well.

654
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
 - Oh, good for them.

655
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,080
 (laughing)

656
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,280
 - I got a few records.

657
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,120
 - Oh yeah.

658
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,280
 - Do you want a little quiz?

659
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,120
 - Yeah.

660
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,520
 - Okay, right, this record was broken in January.

661
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,920
 By Laura Noonan of Sydney,

662
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,760
 it's the most cartoon characters identified in one minute.

663
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,040
 How many?

664
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
 - 20.

665
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,880
 - Okay.

666
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,720
 - In one minute, 40.

667
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,040
 - 106, come on.

668
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,880
 - Wow.

669
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,720
 - Imagine that.

670
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,560
 - That's a lot.

671
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,380
 - Yeah.

672
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,040
 - How, identify what, like, by photos, or?

673
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,880
 (laughing)

674
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,800
 - I mean, yeah, some kind of pictorial.

675
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,640
 (laughing)

676
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,480
 - I thought it was a voice, I guess.

677
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,080
 - Oh, yeah, I thought a voice maybe.

678
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,400
 - No, I think it was pictures, you know,

679
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,760
 Popeye, Betty Boop, Donald Duck, that one, you know.

680
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,960
 - Question two, question two.

681
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,880
 - All right, all right, all right.

682
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,760
 February record, Franz Huber from Milan,

683
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,800
 most swords swallowed while hanging upside down.

684
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,800
 - Okay, I've seen, I reckon,

685
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,480
 I've seen people swallowing around six or seven,

686
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,120
 so I'll go for that, six.

687
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,320
 - Okay, one.

688
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,160
 - 100.

689
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,840
 (laughing)

690
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,680
 - Sorry, you didn't let me finish, 100.

691
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,120
 (laughing)

692
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,680
 - You're both right, it's 100 swords.

693
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,920
 No, of course it's not, it's nine.

694
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,280
 - Oh, okay.

695
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,720
 - Although, is that, if you're upside down,

696
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,800
 is it still swallowing or something?

697
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,640
 - Yes.

698
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,900
 (laughing)

699
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,800
 - What is it, if it's not?

700
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,720
 - It's just like, it's just sort of

701
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,800
 pushing something up, isn't it?

702
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,080
 You know, swallowing is where you swallow something down

703
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,440
 and it goes into your stomach.

704
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,680
 - It still ends up in your stomach though,

705
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,480
 no matter which way you're orientated.

706
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,960
 - Yeah, I think you've forgotten the definition

707
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,800
 of the word swallow.

708
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,640
 - Okay, well.

709
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,300
 - You can't say, oh, I didn't swallow those diamonds,

710
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,840
 officer, because I was upside down at the time.

711
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,800
 (laughing)

712
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,320
 - Please go on your way, sir.

713
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,160
 (laughing)

714
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
 We legally can't arrest you.

715
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,000
 Okay, fine, fine, fine.

716
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,960
 All right, final one, final one.

717
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,060
 March record, this is Miyabi Kugimachi of Tokyo,

718
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,020
 most socks sorted with one foot in one minute.

719
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,860
 (laughing)

720
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,500
 And I want an answer in pairs, please.

721
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,700
 How many pairs of socks sorted?

722
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,040
 - Half.

723
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,880
 - Half of one pair?

724
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,800
 (laughing)

725
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,980
 James has low ball there.

726
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,160
 - 30, 25.

727
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,000
 - Pairs?

728
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,840
 - 400.

729
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,680
 - 12 points.

730
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,480
 - Four, again, 400 pairs of socks.

731
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,000
 - I half listened to the question.

732
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,760
 - Eight pairs of socks per second.

733
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,900
 (laughing)

734
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,740
 - Final answer.

735
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,000
 (laughing)

736
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,900
 - I don't know or care who got it right.

737
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,340
 I think it was Anna, I think it was 15 pairs.

738
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,420
 - You think?

739
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,300
 - No, no, no, I know, I just can't remember what everyone said.

740
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,140
 - Oh, right, I know.

741
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,980
 - I was so angry with you for guessing 400,

742
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,120
 but I kind of forgot Anna's answer.

743
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,240
 I think you guessed sort of--

744
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,080
 - 25.

745
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,920
 - 25.

746
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,760
 - Oh, there we go.

747
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,460
 - Yeah, but I meant singles, so 12.5, I thought.

748
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,020
 (laughing)

749
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,220
 Wasn't this, I think I saw this,

750
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,340
 and wasn't she known on YouTube for foot-related content,

751
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,220
 anyway, I believe the person who won?

752
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,420
 (laughing)

753
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,220
 Or maybe I came across her in a different walk of my life,

754
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,060
 but--

755
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,900
 - Oh, right, okay.

756
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,860
 - What is foot-related content?

757
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,820
 I know it means sexual stuff, but what does that mean?

758
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,100
 I actually don't know what that means.

759
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,260
 Just sexy photos of feet?

760
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,540
 - I don't know, I guess it's sorting socks with your feet.

761
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,380
 I don't know, I've never--

762
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,180
 - Sorting socks with your feet?

763
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,860
 - Yeah, well, that's what she's doing.

764
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,660
 - That's what this lady was doing.

765
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,860
 - I didn't hear the question.

766
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,900
 (laughing)

767
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,100
 - Okay, I have a related fact on these kind of people.

768
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,420
 It's about influencers who do strange things.

769
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,260
 - Oh, okay.

770
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,100
 - And this is Stephanie Matto, who sold farts in a jar.

771
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,460
 - Oh, yeah.

772
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,020
 - And she managed to get very, very sick

773
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,820
 because she was trying to fart too many times,

774
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,540
 'cause she got so many orders,

775
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,620
 she was trying to make as much as possible.

776
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,100
 And what that meant, because I found another story

777
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,180
 in the same week, is that you can end up in hospital

778
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,100
 if you fart too much, and if you don't fart enough.

779
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,980
 Because there was a woman called Cara Clark,

780
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,700
 who got extreme stomach pain

781
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,220
 when she'd been holding in her farts too much.

782
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,500
 And then this influencer, Stephanie Matto,

783
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,140
 had been farting too much,

784
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,780
 and she ended up in hospital as well.

785
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,500
 - Were they in the waiting room at the same time?

786
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,540
 (laughing)

787
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,940
 - Well, what that says to me is there's an optimum amount.

788
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,780
 - Yeah, well, if you read the uncut version of Goldilocks,

789
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:39,540
 there is that scene where one of the bears in hospital--

790
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,020
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

791
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,740
 Why was the second woman holding in her farts?

792
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,940
 - Because she had a new boyfriend.

793
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,260
 - Oh, no.

794
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,620
 - Yeah, she's fine now, they had a laugh about it.

795
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,700
 - Okay, that's pretty good.

796
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,820
 - So what you're saying is we're all walking

797
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,220
 a kind of, quite a thick line of--

798
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,740
 - Yes, I think so.

799
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,220
 But Stephanie has now retired from selling farts and jars.

800
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,060
 You'll be glad to hear.

801
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,220
 Her family are glad to hear.

802
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,980
 But she is now selling her fart jars as NFTs.

803
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,820
 - Okay.

804
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,420
 (laughing)

805
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,420
 There's, can I mention one of the big stories of the year?

806
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,260
 - Yeah, go on.

807
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,820
 - The very infamous Chris Rock Will Smith moment.

808
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,660
 - Oh, yeah.

809
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,020
 - The slap at the Oscars.

810
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,060
 I fell in love with this story because it was just

811
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,780
 a very good example of how very quickly we all jumped

812
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,660
 to insane theories to sort of justify

813
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,820
 why it may have happened.

814
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,380
 So there were two theories that came out immediately

815
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,340
 after it happened.

816
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,340
 One was that someone said that the slap is much less

817
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,340
 interesting when you realize that Will Smith almost

818
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,940
 certainly went through the Scientology courses

819
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,700
 that tell you to unapologetically use slaps

820
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,260
 and physical force to let a fellow Scientologist know

821
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,500
 they've done something wrong.

822
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,220
 So the idea is that in the training,

823
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,260
 they just go kwa-pang on the side of your face

824
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,460
 because they're bored or whatever.

825
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,980
 And that's them letting you know that they don't want it.

826
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,900
 - Can we introduce that to the podcast?

827
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,500
 - Please, please no, please no.

828
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,620
 (laughing)

829
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,600
 I won't last one.

830
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,140
 - Tell us some more unit facts, Andy.

831
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:02,980
 - Pow!

832
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,660
 (laughing)

833
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,420
 - But yeah, so but then Scientologists,

834
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,780
 including Ex-Scientologists,

835
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,140
 jumped to the immediately saying, no, no,

836
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,980
 that's not a thing.

837
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,500
 My favorite one though of all the theories that came out

838
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,260
 is that someone noticed just before Will Smith

839
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,140
 came up to slap him on stage,

840
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,820
 that Chris Rock had dared to say the word Macbeth on stage,

841
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,180
 which you should never do.

842
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,380
 The curse of Macbeth.

843
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,700
 Oh, shit.

844
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,780
 (laughing)

845
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,060
 - Anna, you know what to do.

846
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,980
 - But so just a few moments before he congratulated

847
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,540
 Denzel Washington on his performance

848
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,140
 on the tragedy of Macbeth.

849
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,660
 And so now if you go to the Wikipedia page

850
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,900
 for incidences after invoking the word Macbeth,

851
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,380
 you will find Will Smith slapping Chris Rock.

852
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,180
 - But isn't that only a viable theory?

853
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,540
 And I can't remember his wife's name.

854
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,500
 Maybe it is Macbeth.

855
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,340
 - It's not Lady Macbeth.

856
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,460
 - But it's basically what Will Smith's wife

857
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,180
 would have to be called Macbeth.

858
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,380
 'Cause I believe it was accompanied

859
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,940
 with an explanatory words, wasn't it, by Will Smith?

860
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,860
 He didn't want to leave us in the dark.

861
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,700
 Didn't he say get--

862
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,500
 - Keep my wife's name out of your mouth please.

863
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,020
 - Oh, I see what you're saying.

864
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,980
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

865
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,300
 And his wife's not called Macbeth.

866
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,260
 So that's where that theory completely falls down.

867
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,100
 But aside from that.

868
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,420
 Well, that's the only reason he'd be annoyed

869
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,220
 about him saying Macbeth.

870
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,180
 - No, the whole idea of the Macbeth curse

871
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,420
 is that it's out of your control what then happens.

872
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,860
 So then he goes on to tell a joke

873
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,900
 he thinks is gonna be fine and the curse takes over there.

874
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,860
 - Oh, you're not saying Will Smith was furious

875
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,020
 'cause he broke our rule.

876
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,860
 - I thought that, yeah.

877
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,860
 - The way you told it, it did sound like--

878
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,700
 - Was it Will Smith?

879
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,540
 - Oh, really?

880
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,380
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

881
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,220
 - The Scottish Blair, you dickhead.

882
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,500
 Oh, the garb and tell him.

883
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,080
 (upbeat music)

884
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,180
 - On celebrities, another celebrity of the year

885
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,660
 was Liz Truss.

886
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,500
 - Mmm.

887
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,140
 - And a chair of slight recognition in the room, wasn't it?

888
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,140
 - Can you just, for any international listeners,

889
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,260
 can you just say who?

890
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,820
 - Yes, so she was the short-lived,

891
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,540
 five minutes of fame Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

892
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,380
 - She still lives.

893
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,220
 - She's still alive.

894
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,060
 - She lives.

895
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,380
 - Yeah, Liz Truss lives.

896
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,540
 - She wasn't Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

897
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,260
 For God, how long was it, 37 days?

898
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,100
 - 49 days.

899
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,460
 - 49 days, actually, that's not too bad, is it?

900
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,780
 (audience laughing)

901
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,660
 But she, I learned this year that she was often

902
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,300
 compared to Margaret Thatcher, obviously,

903
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,580
 because she tried to compare herself

904
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,220
 to Margaret Thatcher quite a lot,

905
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,220
 and she actually played Margaret Thatcher

906
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,780
 in a school play when she was eight years old.

907
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,620
 - Oh, really?

908
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,500
 So what was the school play, Macbeth?

909
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,500
 (audience laughing)

910
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,780
 Like, I was in a couple of plays at school,

911
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,380
 and none of them featured a book without your character.

912
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,700
 - It was a nativity.

913
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,780
 - Nativity, yeah.

914
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,060
 (audience laughing)

915
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,060
 - It was, the school play was the 1983 election, so.

916
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,500
 (audience laughing)

917
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,820
 - Wow.

918
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,820
 - It was a weird, they did things differently

919
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,620
 and paisley in the '80s.

920
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,540
 I think that Thatcher election was going on at the time,

921
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,420
 and so they re-enacted it, and they asked people

922
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,940
 if they wanted to be certain candidates,

923
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,020
 and they said, would you like to be Margaret Thatcher

924
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,900
 and try to get people on your side,

925
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,540
 and then everyone would vote for who they liked best,

926
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,340
 who was pitching their political theories,

927
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,060
 and Liz Truss actually got zero votes,

928
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,820
 not even voting for herself.

929
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,940
 (audience laughing)

930
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,500
 - Oh, because she was left-wing at the time,

931
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,620
 because her parents were quite left-wing,

932
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,500
 and she wouldn't have been a Thatcher supporter

933
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,180
 until much later, even at uni, she was in a damn.

934
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,620
 - Yeah, that probably was it.

935
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,140
 What she said was she knew the Tories

936
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,740
 were so unpopular and paisley at the time

937
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,900
 that she couldn't be seen voting for Margaret Thatcher,

938
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,020
 even though it was her in this instance.

939
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,020
 - My school did the 1997 election,

940
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,820
 and it's a good, fun thing to do.

941
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,140
 - Yeah, yeah.

942
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,980
 - Who did you play?

943
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,820
 - Chubb Prescott?

944
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,660
 - Well, we didn't do it as a play.

945
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,500
 - Aw.

946
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,340
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

947
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,460
 - Actually, Michael Gove wasn't around then.

948
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,380
 (audience laughing)

949
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,700
 - Who were you?

950
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,540
 - I was-

951
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,380
 - I was-

952
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,220
 - No.

953
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,060
 (audience laughing)

954
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,580
 We weren't playing individual people,

955
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,940
 it was just like it was done as like,

956
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,020
 I can't remember, there was a talk about it or something.

957
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,140
 - You played people talking about the election.

958
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,380
 - No, it wasn't a play, for fuck's sake.

959
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,540
 (audience laughing)

960
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,380
 - It's not a play.

961
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,220
 - It's not a play.

962
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,040
 - It's not a play.

963
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,880
 - We got to talk about the letters.

964
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,720
 - The trust letters.

965
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,380
 - The first letters, the letters that lasted longer

966
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,940
 than this trust, but of course there's a big argument

967
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,900
 between left and right on Twitter, like there always is,

968
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,860
 with the right-wing saying that actually

969
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,860
 there was some discoloration in the letters,

970
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,300
 and maybe it hadn't lasted as long as Liz Truss,

971
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,540
 but the Atlantic said that it was still usable in a salad.

972
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,380
 (audience laughing)

973
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,220
 So that counts.

974
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,300
 - Do you know what happened to it in the end?

975
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,580
 - Yeah, straight afterwards, for the next month,

976
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,860
 it was doing personalized messages on Cameo

977
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,700
 and it was 13 times.

978
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,540
 (audience laughing)

979
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,380
 - Are you serious?

980
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,700
 - I'm serious, sorry, fine.

981
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,300
 - That's really good.

982
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,020
 - There was a really good quote about Boris Johnson

983
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,900
 in The Times this year.

984
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,020
 Boris Johnson for International List

985
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,020
 is another Prime Minister that we've had this year.

986
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,380
 (audience laughing)

987
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,460
 This is around about the time when he was flying back

988
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,680
 from his holiday to claim the title of Prime Minister again

989
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,180
 and then decided against it.

990
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,340
 And there was a school report written

991
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,940
 by one of his teachers when he was 18,

992
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,860
 and it was just so good and prescient.

993
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,460
 So the school report said,

994
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,420
 "Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticized

995
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,380
 "for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility."

996
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,500
 (audience laughing)

997
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,020
 And surprised at the same time

998
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,140
 that he was not appointed captain of school for next term.

999
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,740
 I think he honestly believes that it is churlish of us

1000
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,020
 not to regard him as an exception,

1001
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,620
 one who should be free of the network of obligation

1002
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,180
 which binds everyone else.

1003
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,700
 (audience laughing)

1004
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,540
 - All right.

1005
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,380
 - Cookie.

1006
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,200
 We were talking just before the show.

1007
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,880
 Do you guys remember the Sue Gray report?

1008
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,260
 This time last year, that wasn't out yet.

1009
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,420
 That's all happened this year.

1010
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,260
 - Oh, wow.

1011
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,100
 - We're getting some nose over there.

1012
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,300
 So we're gonna have to refresh people.

1013
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,140
 - Nah.

1014
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,380
 (audience laughing)

1015
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,700
 It's very boring.

1016
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,260
 - Another Boris-like person, Chair Bolsonaro, in Brazil.

1017
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,660
 He's been away from the public eye

1018
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,140
 for the last couple of months.

1019
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,620
 And no one's really known what's happening.

1020
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,420
 There's been a lot of rumors.

1021
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,540
 - What since the election?

1022
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,380
 - 'Cause he lost, didn't he?

1023
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,580
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1024
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,780
 The vice president said that he'd had COVID three times

1025
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,660
 even though he denied it existed.

1026
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,820
 (audience laughing)

1027
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,300
 And he had a skin disease

1028
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,180
 which stopped him from being able to pot on his trousers.

1029
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,980
 (audience laughing)

1030
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,820
 And so he couldn't do any public events.

1031
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,660
 - Oh, enough.

1032
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,260
 - You can still do Zoom calls, though, can't you?

1033
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,260
 (audience laughing)

1034
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,780
 - That's amazing.

1035
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,880
 - We should think of wrapping up in very,

1036
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,340
 not just yet, but sooner.

1037
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,700
 - Can I say a science fact?

1038
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,540
 - Yeah, of course.

1039
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,180
 - So one thing that we've just been getting this year,

1040
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,420
 it's been in the works for years and years,

1041
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,940
 the James Webb Space Telescope,

1042
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,020
 which was launched, I think,

1043
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,420
 at the very, very end of last year.

1044
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,420
 And we've just got the first photos back this year.

1045
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,820
 It's amazingly exciting,

1046
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,700
 'cause we're seeing lots and lots of the universe

1047
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,420
 in completely new ways.

1048
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,860
 And I've just been reading a bit about it.

1049
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,060
 It's so sensitive, the James Webb Space Telescope.

1050
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:43,020
 It could detect the warmth of a single bee

1051
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,580
 that was on the moon from Earth.

1052
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,420
 - Okay.

1053
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,260
 - Wow.

1054
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,100
 - Isn't that good?

1055
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,940
 - Well, we don't have bees on the moon, though.

1056
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,780
 (audience laughing)

1057
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,980
 - Well, maybe now we'll find out

1058
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,540
 if we do have bees on the moon, then.

1059
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,380
 - Yeah.

1060
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,220
 - And do we?

1061
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,040
 - Well, no.

1062
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,860
 (audience laughing)

1063
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,700
 - That is quite amazing.

1064
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,880
 - Yeah, it's taking these pictures,

1065
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,780
 they get called the baby pictures of the universe,

1066
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,160
 because it's photographing light

1067
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,380
 from 30 and a half billion years ago,

1068
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,820
 really, really long time ago.

1069
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,300
 - So you can see what was happening

1070
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,460
 just after the universe was spawned.

1071
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,300
 - Exactly.

1072
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,900
 Well, that made me think that all of our baby photos

1073
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,900
 are still traveling out into space.

1074
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,000
 As in if you were far enough away,

1075
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,860
 you'd be able to see yourself as a baby,

1076
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,940
 you know, what you were up to.

1077
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,780
 - Yeah, as well.

1078
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,740
 - You'd be able to see your own baby photos happening.

1079
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,580
 - I guess so.

1080
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,420
 - James, you're a physicist.

1081
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,740
 - You'd have to be firing them out

1082
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,580
 somehow.

1083
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,680
 Like, for instance, broadcast stuff.

1084
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,520
 - Yeah.

1085
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,400
 - Something that's broadcast over the airwaves,

1086
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,560
 that would go into space,

1087
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,640
 and that could be seen for a long time.

1088
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,800
 So technically, no such thing as the news is still on.

1089
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,200
 (audience laughing)

1090
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,560
 We got cancelled on Earth,

1091
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,200
 but if you're on Alpha Centurion,

1092
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,680
 you can watch it live.

1093
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,520
 - Oh, wow.

1094
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,960
 - Do you think the owner of,

1095
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,640
 or the originator of the James Webb Space Telescope

1096
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,840
 spams their friends on WhatsApp constantly

1097
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,920
 with annoying photos of the baby universe?

1098
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
 - Yeah, almost certainly.

1099
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,980
 (audience laughing)

1100
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,100
 - Quite ugly, but they have to say something nice.

1101
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,540
 (audience laughing)

1102
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,580
 - I've got a bit of a silly story here,

1103
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,980
 which I just loved.

1104
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,700
 There's a guy in China, two guys in China,

1105
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,980
 that were picking pine nuts from a tree recently,

1106
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,660
 and the tree was a bit high,

1107
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,460
 so they thought the way we'll get to it is,

1108
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,700
 let's just fill up a hydrogen balloon,

1109
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,020
 and we'll attach ourselves to that.

1110
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,900
 So they go up in it,

1111
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,620
 and they're picking their pine nuts,

1112
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,140
 but then the balloon becomes untethered.

1113
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,220
 One of the guys jumps out.

1114
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,860
 The other one's too afraid to.

1115
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,520
 And he disappeared for two days into the air.

1116
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,560
 (audience laughing)

1117
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,880
 He went on a 200-mile-long journey,

1118
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,840
 really high in the sky.

1119
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,400
 They were monitoring as he went.

1120
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,080
 Fortunately, he had his mobile phone,

1121
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,560
 and he was constantly calling,

1122
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,960
 and running low on battery, going, "What do I do?"

1123
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,960
 And they had to navigate him to slowly let air out

1124
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,400
 over somewhere that was landable,

1125
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,640
 but for two days, he just fucked up, yeah.

1126
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,200
 - Wow, what an adventure.

1127
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,600
 - So funny, it's like up.

1128
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,800
 - So great, yeah.

1129
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,660
 - Have we got any last stories?

1130
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,400
 - In Nigeria, they seized thousands of donkey penises

1131
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,300
 because they were mislabeled as cow penises.

1132
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,580
 - Okay.

1133
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,820
 - There's a romance novelist who wrote an online essay

1134
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,540
 called "How to Murder Your Husband",

1135
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,180
 and she was sentenced to life for murdering her husband.

1136
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,260
 (audience laughing)

1137
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,340
 - The old double bluff.

1138
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,440
 It doesn't always work.

1139
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,860
 - And according to a recent study

1140
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,180
 at the University of Singapore,

1141
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,740
 the three funniest word pairs in the English language

1142
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,240
 are played by Parrot, Weasel, Penis, and Spam Skroton.

1143
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,440
 (audience laughing)

1144
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,520
 - We'll try them in the next episode.

1145
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,840
 (audience laughing)

1146
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,420
 (upbeat music)

1147
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:39,320
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts from the year.

1148
