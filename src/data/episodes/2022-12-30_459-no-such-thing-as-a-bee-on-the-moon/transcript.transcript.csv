00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:19,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:19,00:00:21,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:21,00:00:24,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live
00:00:24,00:00:26,"from Up the Creek in Greenwich, London."
00:00:26,00:00:29,(audience cheering)
00:00:30,00:00:32,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:32,00:00:34,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:34,00:00:36,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:36,00:00:38,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones,"
00:00:38,00:00:41,"but not with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:41,00:00:44,but with some of our favorite facts from the last 12 months.
00:00:44,00:00:47,This is No Such Thing as the news meets the book of the year
00:00:47,00:00:48,"that we didn't get to do,"
00:00:48,00:00:51,all smashed into a 30 minute podcast.
00:00:51,00:00:55,"So, in no particular order, here we go,"
00:00:55,00:00:57,starting with a fact.
00:00:57,00:00:58,(laughing)
00:00:58,00:00:59,- How's the jump in?
00:00:59,00:01:01,- I can jump in because we're recording this
00:01:01,00:01:05,at the same time as the World Cup semi-final is happening
00:01:05,00:01:07,between France and Morocco.
00:01:07,00:01:12,"And I have a fact where 40,000 people in France"
00:01:12,00:01:14,"thought they were watching a World Cup match,"
00:01:14,00:01:16,"Germany versus Japan on YouTube,"
00:01:16,00:01:20,but they were actually watching someone playing FIFA 23.
00:01:20,00:01:22,(laughing)
00:01:22,00:01:26,"And apparently this is a group of people in Vietnam,"
00:01:26,00:01:27,this is what they do.
00:01:27,00:01:29,"They play FIFA, they pixelate it"
00:01:29,00:01:31,so that someone watching the game
00:01:31,00:01:32,thinks that maybe they're watching
00:01:32,00:01:35,a pixelated version of the actual match.
00:01:35,00:01:36,And they make hundreds and hundreds of pounds
00:01:36,00:01:37,by just getting people to watch.
00:01:37,00:01:38,"- Oh, 'cause people are, right, right,"
00:01:38,00:01:40,"'cause they add money or whatever, wow."
00:01:40,00:01:41,"- That's the thing, they're genuinely,"
00:01:41,00:01:43,"I read this too, and it's amazing."
00:01:43,00:01:46,"And what a letdown when you find out that it's not,"
00:01:46,00:01:47,and how foolish you are.
00:01:47,00:01:48,I saw some pictures of the pixelated
00:01:48,00:01:50,"and it does kind of look right,"
00:01:50,00:01:52,"but when they clean it up, it's very much a video game."
00:01:52,00:01:53,- Really?
00:01:53,00:01:55,"- Oh yeah, I mean, it is a video game."
00:01:55,00:01:58,"But I thought, I haven't played FIFA almost ever."
00:01:58,00:02:00,"So I assumed it's like, could we do that"
00:02:00,00:02:02,with the podcast?
00:02:02,00:02:04,Like if we sort of play a kind of slightly garbled version.
00:02:04,00:02:08,"So it's like, there it is, there it is, like that."
00:02:08,00:02:09,- Yeah.
00:02:09,00:02:09,- People might listen to that.
00:02:09,00:02:11,- Does that mean there are people out there
00:02:11,00:02:14,"who might think that, like, Wales won the World Cup?"
00:02:14,00:02:16,"- Oh yeah, 'cause you could totally rig it."
00:02:16,00:02:19,"- Apparently they're not that gullible, it says."
00:02:19,00:02:20,(laughing)
00:02:20,00:02:22,"Sorry, sorry."
00:02:22,00:02:24,"- But they did, that's James who was pointing out,"
00:02:24,00:02:26,they matched up the right match.
00:02:26,00:02:27,So everything was fine.
00:02:27,00:02:28,The thing that was the kicker
00:02:28,00:02:30,"was it was a Vietnamese commentary, as you say."
00:02:30,00:02:33,"And that's, but I don't think I would have noticed."
00:02:33,00:02:35,"- But actually, that added sort of realism to it."
00:02:35,00:02:36,- Yeah.
00:02:36,00:02:36,- 'Cause when you go onto YouTube
00:02:36,00:02:38,"and you're watching some hucky channel,"
00:02:38,00:02:39,it might be in a different language.
00:02:39,00:02:41,So it kind of gave realism to it.
00:02:41,00:02:44,"- Yeah, but another news story from the year,"
00:02:44,00:02:45,"the queen, queen died."
00:02:45,00:02:46,- Oh.
00:02:46,00:02:47,- What?
00:02:47,00:02:49,"- Oh wow, way to bring her down on it."
00:02:49,00:02:52,"- So just to cheer us all up,"
00:02:52,00:02:56,"let's remember the greatest tribute paid to Her Majesty,"
00:02:56,00:02:58,"which was by the London tourist attraction,"
00:02:58,00:02:59,Shrek's Adventure.
00:02:59,00:03:01,Do you guys remember this?
00:03:01,00:03:03,A lot of companies jumped on the bandwagon.
00:03:03,00:03:06,Domino's Pizza said everyone at Domino's
00:03:06,00:03:08,joins the nation and the world in mourning.
00:03:08,00:03:10,"Pizza Express went for a slightly different message,"
00:03:10,00:03:12,but they also said the same kind of thing.
00:03:12,00:03:13,"And Shrek's Adventure London said,"
00:03:13,00:03:15,"""Shrek's Adventure London joins millions of mourners"
00:03:15,00:03:19,"""around the UK and world in paying tribute to HM QE2."""
00:03:19,00:03:20,Yeah.
00:03:20,00:03:22,- I went to Shrek's Adventure this year.
00:03:22,00:03:24,I thought you guys thought you went to see the queen.
00:03:24,00:03:27,"- Oh no, the queue was shorted by just a bit"
00:03:27,00:03:29,at the Shrek Adventure on the South Bank of London.
00:03:29,00:03:30,- Wow.
00:03:30,00:03:32,"- Actually, I remember a few weeks ago,"
00:03:32,00:03:34,"I never used this on the podcast,"
00:03:34,00:03:37,but I found out that the longest ever theme park ride
00:03:37,00:03:39,was eight hours long.
00:03:39,00:03:41,So you could have done that ride three times
00:03:41,00:03:42,in the time you'd have got to see the queen.
00:03:42,00:03:43,"- Really, what was it?"
00:03:43,00:03:44,What was the ride?
00:03:44,00:03:46,- It was the Hogwarts one at Universal in America.
00:03:46,00:03:47,- There's an eight hour long Hogwarts ride.
00:03:47,00:03:49,- It was when it first opened.
00:03:49,00:03:51,- What was like a broken motor or something?
00:03:51,00:03:53,"Like what was the, why was it eight hours long?"
00:03:53,00:03:54,- Everyone wanted to go there.
00:03:54,00:03:56,"- Sorry, the queue was eight hours long."
00:03:56,00:03:58,Sorry.
00:03:58,00:03:59,You said the ride.
00:03:59,00:04:01,You said the ride was eight hours long.
00:04:01,00:04:03,- You said you could go on it three times.
00:04:03,00:04:05,"- Well, let's see if I said that by the time"
00:04:05,00:04:07,"the edit goes out, shall we?"
00:04:07,00:04:10,(audience laughing)
00:04:10,00:04:12,- Not knowing it was an eight hour ride when it got on.
00:04:12,00:04:14,(audience laughing)
00:04:14,00:04:15,- Ah.
00:04:15,00:04:18,"- Sorry, I'm the queen."
00:04:18,00:04:19,"- The queeny thing, yeah."
00:04:19,00:04:22,"- So, you know, so you remember for the day"
00:04:22,00:04:24,"of the funeral itself, the queen's coffin"
00:04:24,00:04:25,"was carried on a gun carriage, you know,"
00:04:25,00:04:26,"that was the thing, and it was pulled"
00:04:26,00:04:28,"by lots of naval ratings, that was the thing,"
00:04:28,00:04:31,hundreds of them all pulling it in front and behind
00:04:31,00:04:32,to get it exactly the right speed.
00:04:32,00:04:35,"So that carriage, this is just an interesting thing."
00:04:35,00:04:40,That carriage has been kept in a sort of storage room.
00:04:40,00:04:41,That's not the interesting bit.
00:04:41,00:04:42,(audience laughing)
00:04:42,00:04:44,"It's been kept there for 40 years,"
00:04:44,00:04:47,and every single week its wheels have been oiled
00:04:47,00:04:51,"and turned around one quarter, just in case gravity"
00:04:51,00:04:55,"affected and misshaped the wheels,"
00:04:55,00:04:56,and then they wouldn't work properly
00:04:56,00:04:57,on the day of the funeral.
00:04:57,00:05:00,"- But 'cause, I mean, gravity doesn't do that."
00:05:00,00:05:02,"We've got other wheels in the world, haven't we?"
00:05:02,00:05:03,(audience laughing)
00:05:03,00:05:05,"And we don't turn them a quarter, I think."
00:05:05,00:05:07,"- Yeah, it's not like I come back to my car"
00:05:07,00:05:08,after I haven't driven it for a month
00:05:08,00:05:09,and they're all square.
00:05:09,00:05:11,(audience laughing)
00:05:11,00:05:13,"- What's gravity doing to it, sorry?"
00:05:13,00:05:15,"- It's just, well, it's making it flat."
00:05:15,00:05:16,"- It's a heavy carriage, it weighs tons, you know."
00:05:16,00:05:17,"- I get that, yeah."
00:05:17,00:05:20,"- Yeah, yeah, and the wheels are obviously quite sensitive,"
00:05:20,00:05:21,"and you just want to, you just--"
00:05:21,00:05:22,"- So what, by shifting your wheel,"
00:05:22,00:05:24,that's effectively an anti-gravity machine.
00:05:24,00:05:26,- It's not anti-gravity.
00:05:26,00:05:28,"- No, 'cause you even out the effect of gravity over here."
00:05:28,00:05:29,"- If you flatten out this bit,"
00:05:29,00:05:30,"if you shift it round a quarter turn,"
00:05:30,00:05:32,"you flatten out that bit, and then you flatten out that."
00:05:32,00:05:34,"But it's like doing something culinary,"
00:05:34,00:05:36,like dough or something.
00:05:36,00:05:37,"There's a culinary metaphor in there,"
00:05:37,00:05:40,"which if I cooks, I'd be able to give you right now."
00:05:40,00:05:41,- Right.
00:05:41,00:05:42,Domino's pizza actually had--
00:05:42,00:05:44,(audience laughing)
00:05:44,00:05:45,- In anticipation.
00:05:45,00:05:47,- I just think that's an interesting example
00:05:47,00:05:49,of the extreme thought and preparation
00:05:49,00:05:51,"that had gone into it over decades, you know?"
00:05:51,00:05:53,- You were talking about the different things
00:05:53,00:05:54,that different brands did.
00:05:54,00:05:57,"So Morrison's, apparently, it was said"
00:05:57,00:06:01,that they turned off the beeps in their checkouts
00:06:01,00:06:03,in deference to the Queen dyeing.
00:06:03,00:06:05,"But they denied it, and they said"
00:06:05,00:06:08,they merely turned down the sound.
00:06:08,00:06:08,"- Oh, okay."
00:06:08,00:06:12,"- So instead of going, ""beep,"" it went, ""beep."""
00:06:12,00:06:13,(audience laughing)
00:06:13,00:06:16,"Although for someone who's dyeing, going, ""beep,"""
00:06:16,00:06:18,"""beep,"" ""beep,"" you don't really want that, do you?"
00:06:18,00:06:20,- They should have replaced it with the Big Ben Bongs.
00:06:20,00:06:21,That would have been nice.
00:06:21,00:06:22,- That would have been great.
00:06:22,00:06:23,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:23,00:06:24,- Bong.
00:06:24,00:06:26,(audience laughing)
00:06:26,00:06:29,- She caused confusion as a result of her death in Canada.
00:06:29,00:06:31,"Don't know if you saw this, but in Canada,"
00:06:31,00:06:34,"there was not long after she died, like quite soon,"
00:06:34,00:06:36,there was a citizen ceremony going on
00:06:36,00:06:38,where there were anointing new citizens of Canada
00:06:38,00:06:40,and doing the pledge and so on.
00:06:40,00:06:42,"And it was all done virtually,"
00:06:42,00:06:44,and there was 140 people there or so.
00:06:44,00:06:46,"And they started doing the ceremony,"
00:06:46,00:06:47,"and they had to stop it and say,"
00:06:47,00:06:48,"""Sorry, we can't make you Canadians."
00:06:48,00:06:50,"""We don't know who you're pledging to."
00:06:50,00:06:53,"""Is it the Queen or is it to the King Charles?"
00:06:53,00:06:55,"""So they had to like go off and find out"
00:06:55,00:06:55,"""who the fuck's in charge."""
00:06:55,00:06:57,- Does that mean it doesn't count?
00:06:57,00:06:59,"If they said the Queen instead of the King,"
00:06:59,00:07:00,it doesn't count?
00:07:00,00:07:00,"- I think so, yeah."
00:07:00,00:07:03,"- Really, 'cause quite a lot of the England team"
00:07:03,00:07:05,in the World Cup matches would sing
00:07:05,00:07:07,"""God Save the Queen"" instead of ""God Save the King."""
00:07:07,00:07:09,So do you think we could get a rematch against them?
00:07:09,00:07:11,(audience laughing)
00:07:11,00:07:12,"- Hey, here's a crazy stat that I read,"
00:07:12,00:07:14,"is that the Queen was,"
00:07:14,00:07:15,"she was obviously very old,"
00:07:15,00:07:17,but was she 96 years old when she passed.
00:07:17,00:07:21,"So that means that of all the people alive in the country,"
00:07:21,00:07:25,"only 100,000 people had been around longer than her."
00:07:25,00:07:28,So everyone else of us had her in our lives.
00:07:28,00:07:30,"- That's still quite a lot, I think."
00:07:30,00:07:31,"- 100,000?"
00:07:31,00:07:33,"I can't believe 100,000 people are older than 96."
00:07:33,00:07:33,"- Yeah, it's filled a lot."
00:07:33,00:07:35,"- Okay, it's gone the wrong way."
00:07:35,00:07:37,(audience laughing)
00:07:37,00:07:39,- You just needed to present that with a different term.
00:07:39,00:07:39,"- Yeah, sorry."
00:07:39,00:07:43,"- 100,000 people have been around longer than the Queen."
00:07:43,00:07:44,"- Wow, that's a great fact."
00:07:44,00:07:45,"- Oh, great fact."
00:07:45,00:07:47,(audience laughing)
00:07:47,00:07:48,- And that will make the edit.
00:07:48,00:07:49,- That will make the edit.
00:07:49,00:07:51,(audience laughing)
00:07:51,00:07:54,"- Just on royals, we're not the only royal family"
00:07:54,00:07:57,"in the world, obviously the Saudi Arabian royal family"
00:07:57,00:08:01,forgave Thailand this year for a really interesting thing.
00:08:01,00:08:04,"I had no idea they'd been having this feud for 30 years,"
00:08:04,00:08:06,but like there haven't been any flights
00:08:06,00:08:09,from Saudi Arabia to Thailand for 30 years.
00:08:09,00:08:11,"There have been no ambassadors, anything like that."
00:08:11,00:08:14,"And it was caused because 30 years ago,"
00:08:14,00:08:17,a Thai cleaner who was employed as a servant
00:08:17,00:08:20,"at the Royal Palace, the Saudi Arabian Royal Palace,"
00:08:20,00:08:23,he was called Krankrai Tekhamon.
00:08:23,00:08:27,"He stole $20 million worth of gems, and diamonds,"
00:08:27,00:08:29,and precious stones. - Wow.
00:08:29,00:08:31,"- Hid them in some vacuum cleaner bags,"
00:08:31,00:08:33,"'cause you use what you've got,"
00:08:33,00:08:35,and like duct tape them to himself.
00:08:35,00:08:36,"- Oh, he didn't accidentally suck them up,"
00:08:36,00:08:38,and then... (audience laughing)
00:08:38,00:08:41,"- That may have been his excuse in court, I don't know."
00:08:41,00:08:42,"And he smuggled them out of the country,"
00:08:42,00:08:44,"and I love this, the way he smuggled them out was,"
00:08:44,00:08:46,he got them to Thailand by putting them
00:08:46,00:08:48,"in a big box of cargo, and then he knew"
00:08:48,00:08:49,that the Thai officials at the other end
00:08:49,00:08:52,"would check them at customs, unless he did something."
00:08:52,00:08:54,"So he bribed them with an envelope,"
00:08:54,00:08:56,"stuffed with some cash, and with a note saying,"
00:08:56,00:09:00,"""Hey, in my cargo, I've got loads of really bad porn,"
00:09:00,00:09:02,"and I'd really rather you didn't search it,"
00:09:02,00:09:03,"'cause that would be really awkward for me,"
00:09:03,00:09:04,"so can you not?"""
00:09:04,00:09:05,And they didn't.
00:09:05,00:09:08,- I really... - I would have thought
00:09:08,00:09:10,you'd go for something slightly less tempting
00:09:10,00:09:12,than that wouldn't you?
00:09:12,00:09:15,"- You're right, they're very respectful,"
00:09:15,00:09:16,the Thai officials at customs.
00:09:16,00:09:20,"Anyway, this year, finally, Saudi Arabia forgave Thailand,"
00:09:20,00:09:22,"'cause it became this huge diplomatic incident,"
00:09:22,00:09:24,people were shot dead because of it.
00:09:24,00:09:26,"- Yeah, there were lots of back and forth, yeah."
00:09:26,00:09:27,"- Yeah, that's terrible."
00:09:27,00:09:29,"- But the blue diamond's still missing,"
00:09:29,00:09:31,so check under your seats before you go.
00:09:31,00:09:33,"- It's not Oprah, we're not Oprah."
00:09:33,00:09:34,(audience laughing)
00:09:34,00:09:36,"- Just while we're talking about porn,"
00:09:36,00:09:38,"even though it was just a word,"
00:09:38,00:09:41,I'm just gonna quickly grab that
00:09:41,00:09:43,and bring it over here.
00:09:43,00:09:45,"There was a news story which in Manhattan,"
00:09:45,00:09:48,"a congressional candidate called Mike Itkis,"
00:09:48,00:09:51,he's running and he has a sex positive approach
00:09:51,00:09:52,as part of his campaign.
00:09:52,00:09:54,"So he thought, ""I'd like to demonstrate"
00:09:54,00:09:56,"how positive I am about sex."""
00:09:56,00:09:59,He released a 13 minute long porn video with himself
00:09:59,00:10:02,and a porn star that he filmed and put out
00:10:02,00:10:04,"to say, ""I'm a man of my words."""
00:10:04,00:10:06,That's called Bucket List Bonanza
00:10:06,00:10:09,"and it's with Nicole Sage, the porn star."
00:10:09,00:10:11,And yeah.
00:10:11,00:10:13,"- Sorry, what party is he from?"
00:10:13,00:10:14,"- I would say wherever he is,"
00:10:14,00:10:17,there's a bit of a party going on there.
00:10:17,00:10:19,There was someone called Alexandra Hunt
00:10:19,00:10:22,who ran in the third district for Congress
00:10:22,00:10:25,and she was a former exotic dancer.
00:10:25,00:10:28,"But rather than hiding it, she decided to embrace it"
00:10:28,00:10:32,and one of her campaign slogans was just elect hose.
00:10:33,00:10:35,"The other one said, ""I may have danced for money,"
00:10:35,00:10:38,"but I'm no corporate whore."""
00:10:38,00:10:40,"- Wow. - Isn't that good, isn't it?"
00:10:40,00:10:41,"- Yeah, it's quite good, yeah."
00:10:41,00:10:44,"- There was a guy in Nebraska, Bruce Bostleman,"
00:10:44,00:10:46,who apologized for repeating the rumour
00:10:46,00:10:48,that schools are accommodating children
00:10:48,00:10:50,who self-identify as cats
00:10:50,00:10:54,by putting litter trays in the corner of the classroom.
00:10:54,00:10:55,- Why are they putting litter trays in the corner?
00:10:55,00:10:58,"- Oh, no, they're not."
00:10:58,00:10:59,"- All right, okay."
00:10:59,00:11:01,So the premise of his accusation is flawed.
00:11:01,00:11:03,"- Yes, he accused them of doing something"
00:11:03,00:11:05,that definitely did not happen.
00:11:05,00:11:06,- Right.
00:11:06,00:11:09,"- I've got a fact that was sent in by someone, actually,"
00:11:09,00:11:10,like a couple of weeks ago.
00:11:10,00:11:13,"Someone called Brain Blobs on Twitter,"
00:11:13,00:11:15,"so thank you, Brain Blobs."
00:11:15,00:11:17,"This is a really thrilling thing, guys,"
00:11:17,00:11:20,"so this doesn't sound thrilling,"
00:11:20,00:11:23,but there's been a general conference
00:11:23,00:11:26,"on weights and measures and some scientists,"
00:11:26,00:11:29,"no, stay with it, because some scientists"
00:11:29,00:11:32,from the National Physical Laboratory in the UK
00:11:32,00:11:34,attended that conference on weights and measures.
00:11:34,00:11:36,"And obviously, I don't need to tell you"
00:11:36,00:11:38,that that's the authority of the International Bureau
00:11:38,00:11:39,of Weights and Measures.
00:11:39,00:11:44,"And so, anyway, we've got some new units to celebrate,"
00:11:44,00:11:45,and that's really good.
00:11:45,00:11:48,"So a measure of weight, a ronogram."
00:11:48,00:11:49,A ronogram is...
00:11:49,00:11:52,- It sounds like it's someone's birthday.
00:11:52,00:11:54,(laughter)
00:11:54,00:11:56,And you just send someone a run-around.
00:11:56,00:11:57,- Hello.
00:11:57,00:11:58,- What is it?
00:11:58,00:11:59,- A run.
00:11:59,00:12:00,Happy birthday.
00:12:00,00:12:02,"- Oh, that's so much better than what I've got here."
00:12:02,00:12:04,(laughter)
00:12:04,00:12:07,"So a ronogram is a one followed by 20 zeros, okay?"
00:12:07,00:12:10,"And I think the earth weighs six ronograms,"
00:12:10,00:12:11,"which is really good,"
00:12:11,00:12:12,'cause previously we had to say it weighs
00:12:12,00:12:14,"like 250 million blars,"
00:12:14,00:12:16,and even that was the previous biggest unit.
00:12:16,00:12:17,- Okay.
00:12:17,00:12:18,- So you see what I mean?
00:12:18,00:12:19,"Now we can just say it's six ronograms,"
00:12:19,00:12:21,and that's a much more convenient way of putting it.
00:12:21,00:12:22,- Great.
00:12:22,00:12:23,"- Yeah, that's good."
00:12:23,00:12:23,- That's very handy.
00:12:23,00:12:25,"Yeah, 'cause people often ask how much is the earth weigh,"
00:12:25,00:12:28,and you don't know any more units.
00:12:28,00:12:29,"- Well, there's the ronometer."
00:12:29,00:12:30,"- Oh, yeah."
00:12:30,00:12:31,- And the universe is--
00:12:31,00:12:32,"- It's how you measure runs, isn't it?"
00:12:32,00:12:33,(laughter)
00:12:33,00:12:36,- The entire universe is just one ronometer across.
00:12:36,00:12:37,- What?
00:12:37,00:12:38,"- Oh, that's great."
00:12:38,00:12:39,"- 'Cause it's very big, it's huge."
00:12:39,00:12:40,"- You sound surprised,"
00:12:40,00:12:42,but you haven't just heard that a ronogram is a large thing.
00:12:42,00:12:43,- It's massive.
00:12:43,00:12:44,- It's bigger than a gram.
00:12:44,00:12:46,- But I don't think that then helps you understand--
00:12:46,00:12:47,- Okay.
00:12:47,00:12:48,- Anything.
00:12:48,00:12:49,"- All right, Dan, okay, Dan."
00:12:49,00:12:50,"No, no, no, that's fair enough."
00:12:50,00:12:51,"All right, it's fair enough."
00:12:51,00:12:54,"- Correct me if I'm wrong, it's an expanding universe."
00:12:54,00:12:57,"- Well, eventually it'll be two ronometers."
00:12:57,00:12:59,"- Okay, here's, okay, better example, better example."
00:12:59,00:13:00,"The other end of the scale,"
00:13:00,00:13:02,"they've added some very, very small things as well."
00:13:02,00:13:03,- Yeah.
00:13:03,00:13:06,"- Right, so what about a quectogram?"
00:13:06,00:13:07,Okay?
00:13:07,00:13:08,- Okay.
00:13:08,00:13:10,"- There's a rontogram, which is the weight of an electron."
00:13:10,00:13:13,"- Oh, this'll be the weight of a quark or something like that."
00:13:13,00:13:14,"- Is the weight of something even,"
00:13:14,00:13:16,so the weight added to your phone
00:13:16,00:13:19,if you get one extra byte of data on your phone.
00:13:19,00:13:20,"- Oh, okay, right."
00:13:20,00:13:22,- That is one quectogram.
00:13:22,00:13:24,"- Right, so that has actual weight?"
00:13:24,00:13:25,- Yeah.
00:13:25,00:13:27,"- I swear to God, I emptied my phone"
00:13:27,00:13:28,"some hours the other day, and..."
00:13:28,00:13:31,(audience laughing)
00:13:31,00:13:33,- And it floated away.
00:13:33,00:13:35,"- I'm not kidding, it felt so much lighter."
00:13:35,00:13:36,"I was like, wow."
00:13:36,00:13:37,- Yeah.
00:13:37,00:13:38,- And so that's true.
00:13:38,00:13:39,"- That's it, yeah, that's it."
00:13:39,00:13:40,"- There we go, yeah."
00:13:40,00:13:41,- Do we think any of these are gonna come in handy
00:13:41,00:13:42,at Weight Witchers' Meetings?
00:13:42,00:13:44,(audience laughing)
00:13:44,00:13:45,"- Maybe, yeah."
00:13:45,00:13:48,"- You've lost a rontogram this week, that really is, wow."
00:13:48,00:13:52,"Well, actually on the Earth, an universe,"
00:13:53,00:13:57,worrying news this year is that our days are getting longer
00:13:57,00:14:00,and we don't really know why.
00:14:00,00:14:02,So there's this quite confusing thing
00:14:02,00:14:04,"where in the very, very long term,"
00:14:04,00:14:06,the days are getting slightly longer
00:14:06,00:14:08,'cause the Earth's rotation is slowing
00:14:08,00:14:09,'cause the moon's moving away from us.
00:14:09,00:14:11,That's over millions of years.
00:14:11,00:14:13,You don't need to worry about that.
00:14:13,00:14:15,"But in the short term, like the last 50 years,"
00:14:15,00:14:17,"weirdly counterbalancing that,"
00:14:17,00:14:19,"they've been getting shorter,"
00:14:19,00:14:21,which we haven't really known why.
00:14:21,00:14:24,"And now suddenly, the last couple of years,"
00:14:24,00:14:25,"they've gradually started getting longer,"
00:14:25,00:14:28,don't know if anyone's noticed here.
00:14:28,00:14:29,The extra--
00:14:29,00:14:31,"- It's felt like during Andy's tiny bit, actually."
00:14:31,00:14:34,(audience laughing)
00:14:34,00:14:37,"- So there's a new measure of time,"
00:14:37,00:14:40,"the Andy Graham is, before."
00:14:40,00:14:44,"- It's only a matter of minutes, but you will age."
00:14:44,00:14:46,(audience laughing)
00:14:46,00:14:48,"- But yeah, we think it might be"
00:14:48,00:14:49,because of the Chandler wobble.
00:14:49,00:14:51,(laughing)
00:14:51,00:14:52,- The Chandler wobble.
00:14:52,00:14:53,- Could that be any more weird?
00:14:53,00:14:55,(audience laughing)
00:14:55,00:14:56,"- Lovely, for someone who I know"
00:14:56,00:14:58,has never seen an episode of Friends.
00:14:58,00:14:59,(audience laughing)
00:14:59,00:15:02,- Someone who's read the Wikipedia page of Friends.
00:15:02,00:15:03,(audience laughing)
00:15:03,00:15:05,"- Halfway through, I was thinking I'm out of my depth here."
00:15:05,00:15:07,(audience laughing)
00:15:07,00:15:08,"- Oh, you nailed it."
00:15:08,00:15:11,(upbeat music)
00:15:11,00:15:17,- Do you know whose time on Earth has been made longer
00:15:17,00:15:20,"by one to two years, as of six months from now?"
00:15:20,00:15:22,"- Oh, yes, I think, I mean,"
00:15:22,00:15:24,"despite the way you phrase that, yeah."
00:15:24,00:15:25,(audience laughing)
00:15:25,00:15:26,I think I actually do.
00:15:26,00:15:28,- So it's South Koreans.
00:15:28,00:15:29,- Right.
00:15:29,00:15:31,- South Koreans have just extended their life
00:15:31,00:15:33,"by one to two years,"
00:15:33,00:15:35,and that's gonna happen between June of next year
00:15:35,00:15:38,"because they usually, in South Korea,"
00:15:38,00:15:41,"the way that they measure your age is when you're born,"
00:15:41,00:15:43,you were born one years old.
00:15:43,00:15:46,So they say that nine months is rounded up to
00:15:46,00:15:48,"12 months, you are one, and if you're born,"
00:15:48,00:15:50,"I think it's like close to December,"
00:15:50,00:15:53,then you become two because it just is a new year.
00:15:53,00:15:55,"So you go, you're two, quite quickly,"
00:15:55,00:15:57,"if you're born in, let's say, November."
00:15:57,00:16:00,So that's been a thing where people have always found
00:16:00,00:16:01,"confusing if they go overseas,"
00:16:01,00:16:03,"because their birth certificate or the passports,"
00:16:03,00:16:05,"we all carry our birth certificates, right?"
00:16:05,00:16:06,(audience laughing)
00:16:06,00:16:07,"Their passport will say an age,"
00:16:07,00:16:08,"but they'll say a different age,"
00:16:08,00:16:09,and it's really confusing.
00:16:09,00:16:11,So now South Korea has decided to abandon
00:16:11,00:16:14,"the whole thing of saying you're one or two when you're born,"
00:16:14,00:16:16,and they're gonna be like the rest of the world's metric
00:16:16,00:16:17,or I guess the majority.
00:16:17,00:16:18,- Are they?
00:16:18,00:16:19,"- Yeah, it's really sad."
00:16:19,00:16:20,It's a real shame.
00:16:20,00:16:21,- That's so sad.
00:16:21,00:16:24,"- Well, I just think it's a cool, interesting thing to do."
00:16:24,00:16:26,"- Yeah, it's an interesting cultural difference."
00:16:26,00:16:28,"Yeah, don't do it, Korea."
00:16:28,00:16:29,Go back.
00:16:29,00:16:31,"'Cause it would be cool if, as you claimed,"
00:16:31,00:16:33,"they're adding two years to their life,"
00:16:33,00:16:36,"and if that's how they've tricked them into it, then yeah."
00:16:36,00:16:37,"- Oh, I think if I could, I'm 38,"
00:16:37,00:16:40,"if I could be like, I'm now 36,"
00:16:40,00:16:42,I think that would make my day.
00:16:42,00:16:43,"You wouldn't be, you would have--"
00:16:43,00:16:45,- You're still gonna die on the same day.
00:16:45,00:16:46,- Yeah.
00:16:46,00:16:48,(laughter)
00:16:48,00:16:48,"- Well, yeah, but--"
00:16:48,00:16:51,"- And it's soon, sooner than you think."
00:16:51,00:16:53,- But I will have died two years younger.
00:16:53,00:16:56,"- Also, people, more people will say, ""Such a shame."""
00:16:56,00:16:57,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:16:57,00:16:58,- They were too soon.
00:16:58,00:17:02,"- There were only 100,000 people older than Dan Shriver."
00:17:02,00:17:04,(laughter)
00:17:04,00:17:07,- Can I drag us quickly back to sport?
00:17:07,00:17:08,"- Oh, yeah."
00:17:08,00:17:09,"- Oh, yeah."
00:17:09,00:17:11,"- And well, actually, one thing I just wanted to say"
00:17:11,00:17:14,"about Southgate, which, go with Southgate."
00:17:14,00:17:15,"- Sorry, yes, I'm not familiar."
00:17:15,00:17:16,I'd like to know a little bit.
00:17:16,00:17:17,"- You were thinking the Tube station, weren't you?"
00:17:17,00:17:18,- I was actually thinking a scandal.
00:17:18,00:17:20,(laughter)
00:17:20,00:17:21,- Southgate.
00:17:21,00:17:22,- Did you hear about Southgate?
00:17:22,00:17:24,"- So, football manager for England."
00:17:24,00:17:25,"- England's football manager,"
00:17:25,00:17:28,"and everyone thinks he's a really great guy now,"
00:17:28,00:17:30,so obviously he was the bad guy in the '90s
00:17:30,00:17:31,"because for international listeners,"
00:17:31,00:17:33,"he missed a penalty at the Euros,"
00:17:33,00:17:35,bit of a crisis for his popularity.
00:17:35,00:17:37,Everyone loves him now 'cause he wears waistcoats
00:17:37,00:17:39,"and England's a quite good team,"
00:17:39,00:17:43,"but I found out how he met his wife,"
00:17:43,00:17:44,"I mean, his ropey."
00:17:44,00:17:47,"- Oh, what do you mean with ropes?"
00:17:47,00:17:48,(laughter)
00:17:48,00:17:50,"- It's actually not that bad,"
00:17:50,00:17:53,"but he saw a woman he fancied who worked in a shop in Croydon,"
00:17:53,00:17:55,"and so he, first of all, would like,"
00:17:55,00:17:56,loiter around the shop pretending he was looking
00:17:56,00:17:58,at the clothes there a lot to try and talk to her.
00:17:58,00:17:59,- What sort of shop?
00:17:59,00:18:00,"- Clothes shop, I reckon."
00:18:00,00:18:01,"- Oh, yeah."
00:18:01,00:18:03,(laughter)
00:18:03,00:18:08,"- A hardware store, he gets picked up."
00:18:08,00:18:10,"He's picking up padlocks and going,"
00:18:10,00:18:11,"""I love this t-shirt."""
00:18:11,00:18:13,"- ""I love this high-vis jacket."""
00:18:13,00:18:14,(laughter)
00:18:14,00:18:16,"- Okay, sorry, so he's hanging around the shop."
00:18:16,00:18:16,- He's hanging around the shop.
00:18:16,00:18:20,"He finds out she's got a very serious live-in boyfriend,"
00:18:20,00:18:22,"but it happens, he goes to a restaurant one day"
00:18:22,00:18:24,"and her and her boyfriend are sitting nearby at the table,"
00:18:24,00:18:27,and he senses that they're having a bad time together.
00:18:27,00:18:30,"He senses this relationship on the rocks,"
00:18:30,00:18:32,"so when the boyfriend's not looking,"
00:18:32,00:18:35,he sneaks over to her and drops a letter in her hand
00:18:35,00:18:36,with his number on it.
00:18:36,00:18:37,- A letter?
00:18:37,00:18:40,"- A full review, yeah, yeah, 18 pages."
00:18:40,00:18:44,"A note, I suppose a note,"
00:18:44,00:18:46,"and saying, you know, when this cocks up,"
00:18:46,00:18:48,"which clearly it's going to,"
00:18:48,00:18:49,why don't you give me a call?
00:18:49,00:18:50,And she did.
00:18:50,00:18:51,- And she did.
00:18:51,00:18:53,"- And they had their dates in Tesco Carpac for a long time,"
00:18:53,00:18:55,"'cause they had to be secret, I think."
00:18:55,00:18:56,"- Oh, so she hadn't left,"
00:18:56,00:18:58,they just started dating secretly?
00:18:58,00:18:58,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:18:58,00:19:01,"- Wow, this is a gossipy story, isn't it?"
00:19:01,00:19:02,(laughter)
00:19:02,00:19:05,"- A Tesco Carpac is not a very secret place, either."
00:19:05,00:19:09,It's actually open to anyone who wants to go there.
00:19:09,00:19:11,- I assume her boyfriend shopped at Sainsbury's.
00:19:11,00:19:13,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess so, yeah."
00:19:13,00:19:16,- It's the only safe place for them.
00:19:16,00:19:19,"Anyway, so that is some hot goss from 30 years ago."
00:19:19,00:19:19,- 30 years.
00:19:19,00:19:21,- About Gagasasky.
00:19:21,00:19:23,- Are they still together?
00:19:23,00:19:24,"- Yeah, the art's very sweet, actually."
00:19:24,00:19:26,"- Oh, that's nice, well done, Gareth."
00:19:26,00:19:28,I got sports news here as well.
00:19:28,00:19:30,This is to do with the world of Badminton.
00:19:30,00:19:34,"You'll all know this, I'm sure."
00:19:34,00:19:37,"But just to remind you, four Chinese Badminton players"
00:19:37,00:19:39,were put on probation for two years this year
00:19:39,00:19:43,after failing to try their best to win in 2018.
00:19:43,00:19:46,"So the match happened in 2018, they finally had the thing."
00:19:46,00:19:49,"Basically, the people that were watching the match"
00:19:49,00:19:52,"noticed that either side were sort of not really giving it,"
00:19:52,00:19:54,"they were just sort of like dicking about,"
00:19:54,00:19:56,and that apparently is illegal in Badminton.
00:19:56,00:20:00,"- They did it for a very good strategic reason, right?"
00:20:00,00:20:01,"- What, both sides?"
00:20:01,00:20:01,- Yeah.
00:20:01,00:20:02,- Is it so they can play a different team
00:20:02,00:20:03,in the next round?
00:20:03,00:20:04,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:20:04,00:20:05,- I thought you were gonna say
00:20:05,00:20:07,maybe they'd been paid to throw the match.
00:20:07,00:20:10,"- No, I think it was because they,"
00:20:10,00:20:12,"if whoever won would be playing the better team,"
00:20:12,00:20:15,"and I believe it was two Chinese team, wasn't it?"
00:20:15,00:20:16,"Who, if they won,"
00:20:16,00:20:18,were gonna end up playing the other Chinese team.
00:20:18,00:20:21,"And so that was silly, 'cause they want China to win."
00:20:21,00:20:23,"So it's pointless China playing China,"
00:20:23,00:20:24,'cause they're gonna knock one of them out.
00:20:24,00:20:25,"- Right. - And so they all won,"
00:20:25,00:20:28,and then I think was the other one Korean.
00:20:28,00:20:30,"- I don't know, apparently you know this way better than me."
00:20:30,00:20:31,- I'm just guessing.
00:20:31,00:20:33,I'm just like crystal ball.
00:20:33,00:20:35,"Yeah, I think then the other team were like,"
00:20:35,00:20:37,"hang on, you're trying to lose."
00:20:37,00:20:39,We're gonna try and lose as well.
00:20:39,00:20:42,"And then they got picked up,"
00:20:42,00:20:44,"and then the second half they kind of went for it properly,"
00:20:44,00:20:47,'cause I think they realized we've been caught out.
00:20:47,00:20:49,"- But now they're banned, yeah, for playing shit."
00:20:49,00:20:50,(laughing)
00:20:50,00:20:51,Which is amazing.
00:20:51,00:20:54,"- In 2024, the Olympics are gonna be in Paris."
00:20:54,00:20:57,"This is the fact about next year, I should say."
00:20:57,00:21:00,Because this year they unveiled the mascot
00:21:00,00:21:01,they're gonna have.
00:21:01,00:21:02,"And everyone said the same thing,"
00:21:02,00:21:05,that it looks rather like a clitoris.
00:21:05,00:21:06,- Oh.
00:21:06,00:21:09,"- The woman who designed it, when they said to her,"
00:21:09,00:21:10,"you know, it's a bit weird"
00:21:10,00:21:12,that your mascot looks like a clitoris.
00:21:12,00:21:14,"She said, ""I'm so happy after everything"
00:21:14,00:21:15,"""that's happened with feminism,"
00:21:15,00:21:18,"""that people can now recognize the clitoris."""
00:21:18,00:21:20,(laughing)
00:21:20,00:21:24,"- I saw the mascot, I didn't think it looked like,"
00:21:24,00:21:25,(laughing)
00:21:25,00:21:26,I don't think at all.
00:21:26,00:21:28,"- And they did find, I'm sure everyone saw this today,"
00:21:28,00:21:31,"they found the snakes clitoris for the first time, haven't they?"
00:21:31,00:21:32,- Yeah.
00:21:32,00:21:33,- It's got two.
00:21:33,00:21:34,- It's got two.
00:21:34,00:21:35,- Two.
00:21:35,00:21:37,"- Yeah, 'cause they have hemi-penis, don't they,"
00:21:37,00:21:40,"like, double penises, so they have double clitorises as well."
00:21:40,00:21:41,"- Oh, good for them."
00:21:41,00:21:43,(laughing)
00:21:43,00:21:44,- I got a few records.
00:21:44,00:21:45,- Oh yeah.
00:21:45,00:21:46,- Do you want a little quiz?
00:21:46,00:21:47,- Yeah.
00:21:47,00:21:49,"- Okay, right, this record was broken in January."
00:21:49,00:21:50,"By Laura Noonan of Sydney,"
00:21:50,00:21:53,it's the most cartoon characters identified in one minute.
00:21:53,00:21:55,How many?
00:21:55,00:21:56,- 20.
00:21:56,00:21:56,- Okay.
00:21:56,00:21:57,"- In one minute, 40."
00:21:57,00:22:00,"- 106, come on."
00:22:00,00:22:00,- Wow.
00:22:00,00:22:01,- Imagine that.
00:22:01,00:22:02,- That's a lot.
00:22:02,00:22:03,- Yeah.
00:22:03,00:22:06,"- How, identify what, like, by photos, or?"
00:22:06,00:22:06,(laughing)
00:22:06,00:22:08,"- I mean, yeah, some kind of pictorial."
00:22:08,00:22:09,(laughing)
00:22:09,00:22:10,"- I thought it was a voice, I guess."
00:22:10,00:22:12,"- Oh, yeah, I thought a voice maybe."
00:22:12,00:22:13,"- No, I think it was pictures, you know,"
00:22:13,00:22:15,"Popeye, Betty Boop, Donald Duck, that one, you know."
00:22:15,00:22:16,"- Question two, question two."
00:22:16,00:22:17,"- All right, all right, all right."
00:22:17,00:22:20,"February record, Franz Huber from Milan,"
00:22:20,00:22:23,most swords swallowed while hanging upside down.
00:22:23,00:22:26,"- Okay, I've seen, I reckon,"
00:22:26,00:22:29,"I've seen people swallowing around six or seven,"
00:22:29,00:22:31,"so I'll go for that, six."
00:22:31,00:22:32,"- Okay, one."
00:22:32,00:22:33,- 100.
00:22:33,00:22:34,(laughing)
00:22:34,00:22:36,"- Sorry, you didn't let me finish, 100."
00:22:36,00:22:38,(laughing)
00:22:38,00:22:39,"- You're both right, it's 100 swords."
00:22:39,00:22:41,"No, of course it's not, it's nine."
00:22:41,00:22:43,"- Oh, okay."
00:22:43,00:22:44,"- Although, is that, if you're upside down,"
00:22:44,00:22:45,is it still swallowing or something?
00:22:45,00:22:46,- Yes.
00:22:46,00:22:48,(laughing)
00:22:48,00:22:52,"- What is it, if it's not?"
00:22:52,00:22:54,"- It's just like, it's just sort of"
00:22:54,00:22:56,"pushing something up, isn't it?"
00:22:56,00:22:59,"You know, swallowing is where you swallow something down"
00:22:59,00:23:00,and it goes into your stomach.
00:23:00,00:23:01,"- It still ends up in your stomach though,"
00:23:01,00:23:03,no matter which way you're orientated.
00:23:03,00:23:04,"- Yeah, I think you've forgotten the definition"
00:23:04,00:23:05,of the word swallow.
00:23:05,00:23:06,"- Okay, well."
00:23:06,00:23:09,"- You can't say, oh, I didn't swallow those diamonds,"
00:23:09,00:23:11,"officer, because I was upside down at the time."
00:23:11,00:23:12,(laughing)
00:23:12,00:23:14,"- Please go on your way, sir."
00:23:14,00:23:15,(laughing)
00:23:15,00:23:17,We legally can't arrest you.
00:23:17,00:23:18,"Okay, fine, fine, fine."
00:23:18,00:23:18,"All right, final one, final one."
00:23:18,00:23:23,"March record, this is Miyabi Kugimachi of Tokyo,"
00:23:23,00:23:27,most socks sorted with one foot in one minute.
00:23:27,00:23:27,(laughing)
00:23:27,00:23:29,"And I want an answer in pairs, please."
00:23:29,00:23:31,How many pairs of socks sorted?
00:23:31,00:23:33,- Half.
00:23:33,00:23:33,- Half of one pair?
00:23:33,00:23:35,(laughing)
00:23:35,00:23:36,James has low ball there.
00:23:36,00:23:40,"- 30, 25."
00:23:40,00:23:41,- Pairs?
00:23:41,00:23:41,- 400.
00:23:41,00:23:42,- 12 points.
00:23:42,00:23:45,"- Four, again, 400 pairs of socks."
00:23:45,00:23:47,- I half listened to the question.
00:23:47,00:23:49,- Eight pairs of socks per second.
00:23:49,00:23:50,(laughing)
00:23:50,00:23:51,- Final answer.
00:23:51,00:23:54,(laughing)
00:23:54,00:23:56,- I don't know or care who got it right.
00:23:56,00:23:59,"I think it was Anna, I think it was 15 pairs."
00:23:59,00:24:00,- You think?
00:24:00,00:24:02,"- No, no, no, I know, I just can't remember what everyone said."
00:24:02,00:24:03,"- Oh, right, I know."
00:24:03,00:24:04,"- I was so angry with you for guessing 400,"
00:24:04,00:24:06,but I kind of forgot Anna's answer.
00:24:06,00:24:07,I think you guessed sort of--
00:24:07,00:24:08,- 25.
00:24:08,00:24:08,- 25.
00:24:08,00:24:09,"- Oh, there we go."
00:24:09,00:24:11,"- Yeah, but I meant singles, so 12.5, I thought."
00:24:11,00:24:13,(laughing)
00:24:13,00:24:14,"Wasn't this, I think I saw this,"
00:24:14,00:24:17,"and wasn't she known on YouTube for foot-related content,"
00:24:17,00:24:19,"anyway, I believe the person who won?"
00:24:19,00:24:20,(laughing)
00:24:20,00:24:23,"Or maybe I came across her in a different walk of my life,"
00:24:23,00:24:24,but--
00:24:24,00:24:24,"- Oh, right, okay."
00:24:24,00:24:25,- What is foot-related content?
00:24:25,00:24:28,"I know it means sexual stuff, but what does that mean?"
00:24:28,00:24:30,I actually don't know what that means.
00:24:30,00:24:31,Just sexy photos of feet?
00:24:31,00:24:33,"- I don't know, I guess it's sorting socks with your feet."
00:24:33,00:24:34,"I don't know, I've never--"
00:24:34,00:24:36,- Sorting socks with your feet?
00:24:36,00:24:37,"- Yeah, well, that's what she's doing."
00:24:37,00:24:39,- That's what this lady was doing.
00:24:39,00:24:40,- I didn't hear the question.
00:24:40,00:24:42,(laughing)
00:24:42,00:24:47,"- Okay, I have a related fact on these kind of people."
00:24:47,00:24:49,It's about influencers who do strange things.
00:24:49,00:24:50,"- Oh, okay."
00:24:50,00:24:54,"- And this is Stephanie Matto, who sold farts in a jar."
00:24:54,00:24:55,"- Oh, yeah."
00:24:55,00:24:58,"- And she managed to get very, very sick"
00:24:58,00:25:00,"because she was trying to fart too many times,"
00:25:00,00:25:02,"'cause she got so many orders,"
00:25:02,00:25:04,she was trying to make as much as possible.
00:25:04,00:25:07,"And what that meant, because I found another story"
00:25:07,00:25:10,"in the same week, is that you can end up in hospital"
00:25:10,00:25:14,"if you fart too much, and if you don't fart enough."
00:25:14,00:25:16,"Because there was a woman called Cara Clark,"
00:25:16,00:25:18,who got extreme stomach pain
00:25:18,00:25:21,when she'd been holding in her farts too much.
00:25:21,00:25:23,"And then this influencer, Stephanie Matto,"
00:25:23,00:25:25,"had been farting too much,"
00:25:25,00:25:26,and she ended up in hospital as well.
00:25:26,00:25:28,- Were they in the waiting room at the same time?
00:25:28,00:25:29,(laughing)
00:25:29,00:25:31,"- Well, what that says to me is there's an optimum amount."
00:25:31,00:25:34,"- Yeah, well, if you read the uncut version of Goldilocks,"
00:25:34,00:25:39,there is that scene where one of the bears in hospital--
00:25:39,00:25:41,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:41,00:25:43,Why was the second woman holding in her farts?
00:25:43,00:25:45,- Because she had a new boyfriend.
00:25:45,00:25:47,"- Oh, no."
00:25:47,00:25:49,"- Yeah, she's fine now, they had a laugh about it."
00:25:49,00:25:50,"- Okay, that's pretty good."
00:25:50,00:25:51,- So what you're saying is we're all walking
00:25:51,00:25:54,"a kind of, quite a thick line of--"
00:25:54,00:25:55,"- Yes, I think so."
00:25:55,00:25:59,But Stephanie has now retired from selling farts and jars.
00:25:59,00:26:00,You'll be glad to hear.
00:26:00,00:26:02,Her family are glad to hear.
00:26:02,00:26:05,But she is now selling her fart jars as NFTs.
00:26:05,00:26:06,- Okay.
00:26:06,00:26:08,(laughing)
00:26:08,00:26:12,"There's, can I mention one of the big stories of the year?"
00:26:12,00:26:13,"- Yeah, go on."
00:26:13,00:26:16,- The very infamous Chris Rock Will Smith moment.
00:26:16,00:26:17,"- Oh, yeah."
00:26:17,00:26:19,- The slap at the Oscars.
00:26:19,00:26:21,I fell in love with this story because it was just
00:26:21,00:26:23,a very good example of how very quickly we all jumped
00:26:23,00:26:26,to insane theories to sort of justify
00:26:26,00:26:27,why it may have happened.
00:26:27,00:26:30,So there were two theories that came out immediately
00:26:30,00:26:31,after it happened.
00:26:31,00:26:34,One was that someone said that the slap is much less
00:26:34,00:26:36,interesting when you realize that Will Smith almost
00:26:36,00:26:38,certainly went through the Scientology courses
00:26:38,00:26:41,that tell you to unapologetically use slaps
00:26:41,00:26:44,and physical force to let a fellow Scientologist know
00:26:44,00:26:45,they've done something wrong.
00:26:45,00:26:47,"So the idea is that in the training,"
00:26:47,00:26:49,they just go kwa-pang on the side of your face
00:26:49,00:26:50,because they're bored or whatever.
00:26:50,00:26:52,And that's them letting you know that they don't want it.
00:26:52,00:26:54,- Can we introduce that to the podcast?
00:26:54,00:26:57,"- Please, please no, please no."
00:26:57,00:26:58,(laughing)
00:26:58,00:26:59,I won't last one.
00:26:59,00:27:02,"- Tell us some more unit facts, Andy."
00:27:02,00:27:02,- Pow!
00:27:02,00:27:04,(laughing)
00:27:04,00:27:06,"- But yeah, so but then Scientologists,"
00:27:06,00:27:07,"including Ex-Scientologists,"
00:27:07,00:27:10,"jumped to the immediately saying, no, no,"
00:27:10,00:27:10,that's not a thing.
00:27:10,00:27:13,My favorite one though of all the theories that came out
00:27:13,00:27:16,is that someone noticed just before Will Smith
00:27:16,00:27:18,"came up to slap him on stage,"
00:27:18,00:27:22,"that Chris Rock had dared to say the word Macbeth on stage,"
00:27:22,00:27:24,which you should never do.
00:27:24,00:27:25,The curse of Macbeth.
00:27:25,00:27:26,"Oh, shit."
00:27:26,00:27:28,(laughing)
00:27:28,00:27:31,"- Anna, you know what to do."
00:27:31,00:27:33,- But so just a few moments before he congratulated
00:27:33,00:27:35,Denzel Washington on his performance
00:27:35,00:27:37,on the tragedy of Macbeth.
00:27:37,00:27:39,And so now if you go to the Wikipedia page
00:27:39,00:27:43,"for incidences after invoking the word Macbeth,"
00:27:43,00:27:46,you will find Will Smith slapping Chris Rock.
00:27:46,00:27:48,- But isn't that only a viable theory?
00:27:48,00:27:49,And I can't remember his wife's name.
00:27:49,00:27:50,Maybe it is Macbeth.
00:27:50,00:27:51,- It's not Lady Macbeth.
00:27:51,00:27:53,- But it's basically what Will Smith's wife
00:27:53,00:27:55,would have to be called Macbeth.
00:27:55,00:27:56,'Cause I believe it was accompanied
00:27:56,00:28:00,"with an explanatory words, wasn't it, by Will Smith?"
00:28:00,00:28:01,He didn't want to leave us in the dark.
00:28:01,00:28:02,Didn't he say get--
00:28:02,00:28:05,- Keep my wife's name out of your mouth please.
00:28:05,00:28:07,"- Oh, I see what you're saying."
00:28:07,00:28:07,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:28:07,00:28:10,And his wife's not called Macbeth.
00:28:10,00:28:12,So that's where that theory completely falls down.
00:28:12,00:28:13,But aside from that.
00:28:13,00:28:14,"Well, that's the only reason he'd be annoyed"
00:28:14,00:28:16,about him saying Macbeth.
00:28:16,00:28:18,"- No, the whole idea of the Macbeth curse"
00:28:18,00:28:20,is that it's out of your control what then happens.
00:28:20,00:28:21,So then he goes on to tell a joke
00:28:21,00:28:23,he thinks is gonna be fine and the curse takes over there.
00:28:23,00:28:25,"- Oh, you're not saying Will Smith was furious"
00:28:25,00:28:27,'cause he broke our rule.
00:28:27,00:28:27,"- I thought that, yeah."
00:28:27,00:28:29,"- The way you told it, it did sound like--"
00:28:29,00:28:30,- Was it Will Smith?
00:28:30,00:28:31,"- Oh, really?"
00:28:31,00:28:32,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:28:32,00:28:34,"- The Scottish Blair, you dickhead."
00:28:34,00:28:36,"Oh, the garb and tell him."
00:28:37,00:28:40,(upbeat music)
00:28:40,00:28:46,"- On celebrities, another celebrity of the year"
00:28:46,00:28:47,was Liz Truss.
00:28:47,00:28:48,- Mmm.
00:28:48,00:28:52,"- And a chair of slight recognition in the room, wasn't it?"
00:28:52,00:28:54,"- Can you just, for any international listeners,"
00:28:54,00:28:55,can you just say who?
00:28:55,00:28:57,"- Yes, so she was the short-lived,"
00:28:57,00:29:00,five minutes of fame Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
00:29:00,00:29:01,- She still lives.
00:29:01,00:29:02,- She's still alive.
00:29:02,00:29:03,- She lives.
00:29:03,00:29:05,"- Yeah, Liz Truss lives."
00:29:05,00:29:06,- She wasn't Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
00:29:06,00:29:08,"For God, how long was it, 37 days?"
00:29:08,00:29:09,- 49 days.
00:29:09,00:29:11,"- 49 days, actually, that's not too bad, is it?"
00:29:11,00:29:12,(audience laughing)
00:29:12,00:29:15,"But she, I learned this year that she was often"
00:29:15,00:29:17,"compared to Margaret Thatcher, obviously,"
00:29:17,00:29:18,because she tried to compare herself
00:29:18,00:29:20,"to Margaret Thatcher quite a lot,"
00:29:20,00:29:23,and she actually played Margaret Thatcher
00:29:23,00:29:25,in a school play when she was eight years old.
00:29:25,00:29:26,"- Oh, really?"
00:29:26,00:29:28,"So what was the school play, Macbeth?"
00:29:28,00:29:31,(audience laughing)
00:29:31,00:29:34,"Like, I was in a couple of plays at school,"
00:29:34,00:29:37,and none of them featured a book without your character.
00:29:37,00:29:38,- It was a nativity.
00:29:38,00:29:39,"- Nativity, yeah."
00:29:39,00:29:41,(audience laughing)
00:29:41,00:29:45,"- It was, the school play was the 1983 election, so."
00:29:45,00:29:47,(audience laughing)
00:29:47,00:29:48,- Wow.
00:29:48,00:29:51,"- It was a weird, they did things differently"
00:29:51,00:29:53,and paisley in the '80s.
00:29:53,00:29:57,"I think that Thatcher election was going on at the time,"
00:29:57,00:29:59,"and so they re-enacted it, and they asked people"
00:29:59,00:30:00,"if they wanted to be certain candidates,"
00:30:00,00:30:03,"and they said, would you like to be Margaret Thatcher"
00:30:03,00:30:04,"and try to get people on your side,"
00:30:04,00:30:07,"and then everyone would vote for who they liked best,"
00:30:07,00:30:09,"who was pitching their political theories,"
00:30:09,00:30:12,"and Liz Truss actually got zero votes,"
00:30:12,00:30:13,not even voting for herself.
00:30:13,00:30:14,(audience laughing)
00:30:14,00:30:17,"- Oh, because she was left-wing at the time,"
00:30:17,00:30:18,"because her parents were quite left-wing,"
00:30:18,00:30:20,and she wouldn't have been a Thatcher supporter
00:30:20,00:30:23,"until much later, even at uni, she was in a damn."
00:30:23,00:30:24,"- Yeah, that probably was it."
00:30:24,00:30:26,What she said was she knew the Tories
00:30:26,00:30:27,were so unpopular and paisley at the time
00:30:27,00:30:29,"that she couldn't be seen voting for Margaret Thatcher,"
00:30:29,00:30:32,even though it was her in this instance.
00:30:32,00:30:34,"- My school did the 1997 election,"
00:30:34,00:30:36,"and it's a good, fun thing to do."
00:30:36,00:30:38,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:30:38,00:30:38,- Who did you play?
00:30:38,00:30:39,- Chubb Prescott?
00:30:39,00:30:40,"- Well, we didn't do it as a play."
00:30:40,00:30:41,- Aw.
00:30:41,00:30:42,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:30:42,00:30:43,"- Actually, Michael Gove wasn't around then."
00:30:43,00:30:45,(audience laughing)
00:30:45,00:30:46,- Who were you?
00:30:46,00:30:47,- I was-
00:30:47,00:30:48,- I was-
00:30:48,00:30:49,- No.
00:30:49,00:30:50,(audience laughing)
00:30:50,00:30:51,"We weren't playing individual people,"
00:30:51,00:30:52,"it was just like it was done as like,"
00:30:52,00:30:55,"I can't remember, there was a talk about it or something."
00:30:55,00:30:57,- You played people talking about the election.
00:30:57,00:30:59,"- No, it wasn't a play, for fuck's sake."
00:30:59,00:31:00,(audience laughing)
00:31:00,00:31:01,- It's not a play.
00:31:01,00:31:02,- It's not a play.
00:31:02,00:31:03,- It's not a play.
00:31:03,00:31:03,- We got to talk about the letters.
00:31:03,00:31:04,- The trust letters.
00:31:04,00:31:06,"- The first letters, the letters that lasted longer"
00:31:06,00:31:08,"than this trust, but of course there's a big argument"
00:31:08,00:31:11,"between left and right on Twitter, like there always is,"
00:31:11,00:31:13,with the right-wing saying that actually
00:31:13,00:31:16,"there was some discoloration in the letters,"
00:31:16,00:31:20,"and maybe it hadn't lasted as long as Liz Truss,"
00:31:20,00:31:23,but the Atlantic said that it was still usable in a salad.
00:31:23,00:31:24,(audience laughing)
00:31:24,00:31:25,So that counts.
00:31:25,00:31:26,- Do you know what happened to it in the end?
00:31:26,00:31:28,"- Yeah, straight afterwards, for the next month,"
00:31:28,00:31:30,it was doing personalized messages on Cameo
00:31:30,00:31:31,and it was 13 times.
00:31:31,00:31:32,(audience laughing)
00:31:32,00:31:33,- Are you serious?
00:31:33,00:31:34,"- I'm serious, sorry, fine."
00:31:34,00:31:36,- That's really good.
00:31:36,00:31:38,- There was a really good quote about Boris Johnson
00:31:38,00:31:39,in The Times this year.
00:31:39,00:31:41,Boris Johnson for International List
00:31:41,00:31:43,is another Prime Minister that we've had this year.
00:31:43,00:31:45,(audience laughing)
00:31:45,00:31:47,This is around about the time when he was flying back
00:31:47,00:31:50,from his holiday to claim the title of Prime Minister again
00:31:50,00:31:52,and then decided against it.
00:31:52,00:31:54,And there was a school report written
00:31:54,00:31:55,"by one of his teachers when he was 18,"
00:31:55,00:31:57,and it was just so good and prescient.
00:31:57,00:31:59,"So the school report said,"
00:31:59,00:32:02,"""Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticized"
00:32:02,00:32:05,"""for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility."""
00:32:05,00:32:06,(audience laughing)
00:32:06,00:32:08,And surprised at the same time
00:32:08,00:32:11,that he was not appointed captain of school for next term.
00:32:11,00:32:13,I think he honestly believes that it is churlish of us
00:32:13,00:32:16,"not to regard him as an exception,"
00:32:16,00:32:18,one who should be free of the network of obligation
00:32:18,00:32:20,which binds everyone else.
00:32:20,00:32:21,(audience laughing)
00:32:21,00:32:22,- All right.
00:32:22,00:32:23,- Cookie.
00:32:23,00:32:24,We were talking just before the show.
00:32:24,00:32:26,Do you guys remember the Sue Gray report?
00:32:26,00:32:29,"This time last year, that wasn't out yet."
00:32:29,00:32:30,That's all happened this year.
00:32:30,00:32:31,"- Oh, wow."
00:32:31,00:32:32,- We're getting some nose over there.
00:32:32,00:32:33,So we're gonna have to refresh people.
00:32:33,00:32:34,- Nah.
00:32:34,00:32:35,(audience laughing)
00:32:35,00:32:36,It's very boring.
00:32:36,00:32:40,"- Another Boris-like person, Chair Bolsonaro, in Brazil."
00:32:40,00:32:41,He's been away from the public eye
00:32:41,00:32:43,for the last couple of months.
00:32:43,00:32:44,And no one's really known what's happening.
00:32:44,00:32:46,There's been a lot of rumors.
00:32:46,00:32:47,- What since the election?
00:32:47,00:32:48,"- 'Cause he lost, didn't he?"
00:32:48,00:32:49,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:32:49,00:32:53,The vice president said that he'd had COVID three times
00:32:53,00:32:55,even though he denied it existed.
00:32:55,00:32:56,(audience laughing)
00:32:56,00:32:58,And he had a skin disease
00:32:58,00:33:01,which stopped him from being able to pot on his trousers.
00:33:01,00:33:03,(audience laughing)
00:33:03,00:33:06,And so he couldn't do any public events.
00:33:06,00:33:07,"- Oh, enough."
00:33:07,00:33:09,"- You can still do Zoom calls, though, can't you?"
00:33:09,00:33:12,(audience laughing)
00:33:12,00:33:13,- That's amazing.
00:33:13,00:33:15,"- We should think of wrapping up in very,"
00:33:15,00:33:17,"not just yet, but sooner."
00:33:17,00:33:18,- Can I say a science fact?
00:33:18,00:33:19,"- Yeah, of course."
00:33:19,00:33:21,"- So one thing that we've just been getting this year,"
00:33:21,00:33:22,"it's been in the works for years and years,"
00:33:22,00:33:23,"the James Webb Space Telescope,"
00:33:23,00:33:26,"which was launched, I think,"
00:33:26,00:33:27,"at the very, very end of last year."
00:33:27,00:33:29,And we've just got the first photos back this year.
00:33:29,00:33:30,"It's amazingly exciting,"
00:33:30,00:33:32,'cause we're seeing lots and lots of the universe
00:33:32,00:33:34,in completely new ways.
00:33:34,00:33:35,And I've just been reading a bit about it.
00:33:35,00:33:39,"It's so sensitive, the James Webb Space Telescope."
00:33:39,00:33:43,It could detect the warmth of a single bee
00:33:43,00:33:46,that was on the moon from Earth.
00:33:46,00:33:47,- Okay.
00:33:47,00:33:48,- Wow.
00:33:48,00:33:49,- Isn't that good?
00:33:49,00:33:49,"- Well, we don't have bees on the moon, though."
00:33:49,00:33:50,(audience laughing)
00:33:50,00:33:51,"- Well, maybe now we'll find out"
00:33:51,00:33:53,"if we do have bees on the moon, then."
00:33:53,00:33:54,- Yeah.
00:33:54,00:33:55,- And do we?
00:33:55,00:33:56,"- Well, no."
00:33:56,00:33:56,(audience laughing)
00:33:56,00:33:57,- That is quite amazing.
00:33:57,00:33:58,"- Yeah, it's taking these pictures,"
00:33:58,00:34:00,"they get called the baby pictures of the universe,"
00:34:00,00:34:02,because it's photographing light
00:34:02,00:34:04,"from 30 and a half billion years ago,"
00:34:04,00:34:05,"really, really long time ago."
00:34:05,00:34:07,- So you can see what was happening
00:34:07,00:34:08,just after the universe was spawned.
00:34:08,00:34:09,- Exactly.
00:34:09,00:34:10,"Well, that made me think that all of our baby photos"
00:34:10,00:34:15,are still traveling out into space.
00:34:15,00:34:18,"As in if you were far enough away,"
00:34:18,00:34:19,"you'd be able to see yourself as a baby,"
00:34:19,00:34:20,"you know, what you were up to."
00:34:20,00:34:21,"- Yeah, as well."
00:34:21,00:34:22,- You'd be able to see your own baby photos happening.
00:34:22,00:34:23,- I guess so.
00:34:23,00:34:24,"- James, you're a physicist."
00:34:24,00:34:25,- You'd have to be firing them out
00:34:25,00:34:26,somehow.
00:34:26,00:34:28,"Like, for instance, broadcast stuff."
00:34:28,00:34:29,- Yeah.
00:34:29,00:34:31,"- Something that's broadcast over the airwaves,"
00:34:31,00:34:32,"that would go into space,"
00:34:32,00:34:33,and that could be seen for a long time.
00:34:33,00:34:36,"So technically, no such thing as the news is still on."
00:34:36,00:34:38,(audience laughing)
00:34:38,00:34:39,"We got cancelled on Earth,"
00:34:39,00:34:41,"but if you're on Alpha Centurion,"
00:34:41,00:34:42,you can watch it live.
00:34:42,00:34:43,"- Oh, wow."
00:34:43,00:34:45,"- Do you think the owner of,"
00:34:45,00:34:48,or the originator of the James Webb Space Telescope
00:34:48,00:34:50,spams their friends on WhatsApp constantly
00:34:50,00:34:52,with annoying photos of the baby universe?
00:34:52,00:34:53,"- Yeah, almost certainly."
00:34:53,00:34:55,(audience laughing)
00:34:55,00:34:58,"- Quite ugly, but they have to say something nice."
00:34:58,00:35:00,(audience laughing)
00:35:00,00:35:02,"- I've got a bit of a silly story here,"
00:35:02,00:35:03,which I just loved.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"There's a guy in China, two guys in China,"
00:35:05,00:35:07,"that were picking pine nuts from a tree recently,"
00:35:07,00:35:09,"and the tree was a bit high,"
00:35:09,00:35:11,"so they thought the way we'll get to it is,"
00:35:11,00:35:13,"let's just fill up a hydrogen balloon,"
00:35:13,00:35:16,and we'll attach ourselves to that.
00:35:16,00:35:16,"So they go up in it,"
00:35:16,00:35:18,"and they're picking their pine nuts,"
00:35:18,00:35:21,but then the balloon becomes untethered.
00:35:21,00:35:22,One of the guys jumps out.
00:35:22,00:35:23,The other one's too afraid to.
00:35:23,00:35:26,And he disappeared for two days into the air.
00:35:26,00:35:27,(audience laughing)
00:35:27,00:35:29,"He went on a 200-mile-long journey,"
00:35:29,00:35:32,really high in the sky.
00:35:32,00:35:34,They were monitoring as he went.
00:35:34,00:35:36,"Fortunately, he had his mobile phone,"
00:35:36,00:35:37,"and he was constantly calling,"
00:35:37,00:35:39,"and running low on battery, going, ""What do I do?"""
00:35:39,00:35:42,And they had to navigate him to slowly let air out
00:35:42,00:35:44,"over somewhere that was landable,"
00:35:44,00:35:46,"but for two days, he just fucked up, yeah."
00:35:46,00:35:49,"- Wow, what an adventure."
00:35:49,00:35:51,"- So funny, it's like up."
00:35:51,00:35:53,"- So great, yeah."
00:35:53,00:35:55,- Have we got any last stories?
00:35:55,00:35:59,"- In Nigeria, they seized thousands of donkey penises"
00:35:59,00:36:02,because they were mislabeled as cow penises.
00:36:02,00:36:03,- Okay.

00:36:07,00:36:10,and she was sentenced to life for murdering her husband.
00:36:10,00:36:12,(audience laughing)
00:36:12,00:36:13,- The old double bluff.
00:36:13,00:36:14,It doesn't always work.
