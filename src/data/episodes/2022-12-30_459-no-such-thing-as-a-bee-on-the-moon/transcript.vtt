00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.060
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.220
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.540
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.700
 from Up the Creek in Greenwich, London.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.700
 (audience cheering)

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.500
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.100
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.020
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.180
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.120
 but not with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.620
 but with some of our favorite facts from the last 12 months.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.760
 This is No Such Thing as the news meets the book of the year

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.900
 that we didn't get to do,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.100
 all smashed into a 30 minute podcast.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.420
 So, in no particular order, here we go,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.480
 starting with a fact.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.400
 (laughing)

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.620
 - How's the jump in?

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.980
 - I can jump in because we're recording this

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.980
 at the same time as the World Cup semi-final is happening

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.580
 between France and Morocco.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.060
 And I have a fact where 40,000 people in France

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.380
 thought they were watching a World Cup match,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.660
 Germany versus Japan on YouTube,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.000
 but they were actually watching someone playing FIFA 23.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.260
 (laughing)

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.000
 And apparently this is a group of people in Vietnam,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.060
 this is what they do.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.560
 They play FIFA, they pixelate it

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.080
 so that someone watching the game

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.400
 thinks that maybe they're watching

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.040
 a pixelated version of the actual match.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.920
 And they make hundreds and hundreds of pounds

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.760
 by just getting people to watch.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.600
 - Oh, 'cause people are, right, right,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.640
 'cause they add money or whatever, wow.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.840
 - That's the thing, they're genuinely,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.480
 I read this too, and it's amazing.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.280
 And what a letdown when you find out that it's not,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.200
 and how foolish you are.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.920
 I saw some pictures of the pixelated

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.480
 and it does kind of look right,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.920
 but when they clean it up, it's very much a video game.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.760
 - Really?

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.680
 - Oh yeah, I mean, it is a video game.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.740
 But I thought, I haven't played FIFA almost ever.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.900
 So I assumed it's like, could we do that

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.100
 with the podcast?

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.980
 Like if we sort of play a kind of slightly garbled version.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.180
 So it's like, there it is, there it is, like that.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.020
 - Yeah.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.860
 - People might listen to that.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.420
 - Does that mean there are people out there

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.580
 who might think that, like, Wales won the World Cup?

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.700
 - Oh yeah, 'cause you could totally rig it.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.020
 - Apparently they're not that gullible, it says.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.540
 (laughing)

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.220
 Sorry, sorry.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.500
 - But they did, that's James who was pointing out,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.080
 they matched up the right match.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.260
 So everything was fine.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.560
 The thing that was the kicker

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.680
 was it was a Vietnamese commentary, as you say.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.080
 And that's, but I don't think I would have noticed.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.280
 - But actually, that added sort of realism to it.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.120
 - Yeah.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.960
 - 'Cause when you go onto YouTube

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.200
 and you're watching some hucky channel,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.640
 it might be in a different language.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.360
 So it kind of gave realism to it.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.120
 - Yeah, but another news story from the year,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.800
 the queen, queen died.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.640
 - Oh.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.480
 - What?

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.900
 - Oh wow, way to bring her down on it.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.960
 - So just to cheer us all up,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.260
 let's remember the greatest tribute paid to Her Majesty,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.320
 which was by the London tourist attraction,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.660
 Shrek's Adventure.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.260
 Do you guys remember this?

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.740
 A lot of companies jumped on the bandwagon.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.300
 Domino's Pizza said everyone at Domino's

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.220
 joins the nation and the world in mourning.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.020
 Pizza Express went for a slightly different message,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.100
 but they also said the same kind of thing.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.840
 And Shrek's Adventure London said,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.820
 "Shrek's Adventure London joins millions of mourners

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.380
 "around the UK and world in paying tribute to HM QE2."

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.220
 Yeah.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.600
 - I went to Shrek's Adventure this year.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.380
 I thought you guys thought you went to see the queen.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.060
 - Oh no, the queue was shorted by just a bit

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.860
 at the Shrek Adventure on the South Bank of London.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.700
 - Wow.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.380
 - Actually, I remember a few weeks ago,

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.060
 I never used this on the podcast,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.140
 but I found out that the longest ever theme park ride

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.060
 was eight hours long.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.220
 So you could have done that ride three times

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.620
 in the time you'd have got to see the queen.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.460
 - Really, what was it?

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.300
 What was the ride?

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.420
 - It was the Hogwarts one at Universal in America.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.980
 - There's an eight hour long Hogwarts ride.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.420
 - It was when it first opened.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.300
 - What was like a broken motor or something?

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.360
 Like what was the, why was it eight hours long?

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.480
 - Everyone wanted to go there.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.920
 - Sorry, the queue was eight hours long.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.560
 Sorry.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.400
 You said the ride.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.400
 You said the ride was eight hours long.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.280
 - You said you could go on it three times.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.880
 - Well, let's see if I said that by the time

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.180
 the edit goes out, shall we?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.120
 (audience laughing)

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.640
 - Not knowing it was an eight hour ride when it got on.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.840
 (audience laughing)

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.680
 - Ah.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.520
 - Sorry, I'm the queen.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.360
 - The queeny thing, yeah.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.100
 - So, you know, so you remember for the day

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.060
 of the funeral itself, the queen's coffin

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.660
 was carried on a gun carriage, you know,

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.540
 that was the thing, and it was pulled

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.460
 by lots of naval ratings, that was the thing,

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.060
 hundreds of them all pulling it in front and behind

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.340
 to get it exactly the right speed.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.680
 So that carriage, this is just an interesting thing.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.060
 That carriage has been kept in a sort of storage room.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.420
 That's not the interesting bit.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.700
 (audience laughing)

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.420
 It's been kept there for 40 years,

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.380
 and every single week its wheels have been oiled

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.820
 and turned around one quarter, just in case gravity

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.240
 affected and misshaped the wheels,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.720
 and then they wouldn't work properly

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.880
 on the day of the funeral.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.200
 - But 'cause, I mean, gravity doesn't do that.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.160
 We've got other wheels in the world, haven't we?

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.000
 (audience laughing)

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.360
 And we don't turn them a quarter, I think.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.080
 - Yeah, it's not like I come back to my car

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.320
 after I haven't driven it for a month

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.360
 and they're all square.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.440
 (audience laughing)

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.080
 - What's gravity doing to it, sorry?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.280
 - It's just, well, it's making it flat.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.960
 - It's a heavy carriage, it weighs tons, you know.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.800
 - I get that, yeah.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.100
 - Yeah, yeah, and the wheels are obviously quite sensitive,

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.440
 and you just want to, you just--

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.500
 - So what, by shifting your wheel,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.720
 that's effectively an anti-gravity machine.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.060
 - It's not anti-gravity.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.460
 - No, 'cause you even out the effect of gravity over here.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.460
 - If you flatten out this bit,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.580
 if you shift it round a quarter turn,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.580
 you flatten out that bit, and then you flatten out that.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.620
 But it's like doing something culinary,

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.300
 like dough or something.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.740
 There's a culinary metaphor in there,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.460
 which if I cooks, I'd be able to give you right now.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.460
 - Right.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.780
 Domino's pizza actually had--

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.820
 (audience laughing)

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.660
 - In anticipation.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.160
 - I just think that's an interesting example

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.480
 of the extreme thought and preparation

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.720
 that had gone into it over decades, you know?

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.240
 - You were talking about the different things

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.960
 that different brands did.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.960
 So Morrison's, apparently, it was said

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.240
 that they turned off the beeps in their checkouts

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.480
 in deference to the Queen dyeing.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.320
 But they denied it, and they said

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.000
 they merely turned down the sound.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.840
 - Oh, okay.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.660
 - So instead of going, "beep," it went, "beep."

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.760
 (audience laughing)

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.000
 Although for someone who's dyeing, going, "beep,"

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.560
 "beep," "beep," you don't really want that, do you?

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.840
 - They should have replaced it with the Big Ben Bongs.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.800
 That would have been nice.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.800
 - That would have been great.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.720
 - Bong.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.400
 (audience laughing)

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.960
 - She caused confusion as a result of her death in Canada.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.720
 Don't know if you saw this, but in Canada,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.440
 there was not long after she died, like quite soon,

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.280
 there was a citizen ceremony going on

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.800
 where there were anointing new citizens of Canada

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.800
 and doing the pledge and so on.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.720
 And it was all done virtually,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.680
 and there was 140 people there or so.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.320
 And they started doing the ceremony,

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.360
 and they had to stop it and say,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.920
 "Sorry, we can't make you Canadians.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.400
 "We don't know who you're pledging to.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.040
 "Is it the Queen or is it to the King Charles?

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.120
 "So they had to like go off and find out

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.960
 "who the fuck's in charge."

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.280
 - Does that mean it doesn't count?

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.160
 If they said the Queen instead of the King,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.000
 it doesn't count?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.960
 - I think so, yeah.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.560
 - Really, 'cause quite a lot of the England team

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.040
 in the World Cup matches would sing

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.760
 "God Save the Queen" instead of "God Save the King."

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.520
 So do you think we could get a rematch against them?

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.120
 (audience laughing)

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.760
 - Hey, here's a crazy stat that I read,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.440
 is that the Queen was,

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.360
 she was obviously very old,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.320
 but was she 96 years old when she passed.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.360
 So that means that of all the people alive in the country,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.680
 only 100,000 people had been around longer than her.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.920
 So everyone else of us had her in our lives.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.320
 - That's still quite a lot, I think.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.240
 - 100,000?

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.080
 I can't believe 100,000 people are older than 96.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.920
 - Yeah, it's filled a lot.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.240
 - Okay, it's gone the wrong way.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.000
 (audience laughing)

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.120
 - You just needed to present that with a different term.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.960
 - Yeah, sorry.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.360
 - 100,000 people have been around longer than the Queen.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.520
 - Wow, that's a great fact.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.360
 - Oh, great fact.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.240
 (audience laughing)

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.280
 - And that will make the edit.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.320
 - That will make the edit.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.120
 (audience laughing)

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.400
 - Just on royals, we're not the only royal family

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.440
 in the world, obviously the Saudi Arabian royal family

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.520
 forgave Thailand this year for a really interesting thing.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.720
 I had no idea they'd been having this feud for 30 years,

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.720
 but like there haven't been any flights

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.000
 from Saudi Arabia to Thailand for 30 years.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.160
 There have been no ambassadors, anything like that.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.800
 And it was caused because 30 years ago,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.560
 a Thai cleaner who was employed as a servant

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.720
 at the Royal Palace, the Saudi Arabian Royal Palace,

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.120
 he was called Krankrai Tekhamon.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.400
 He stole $20 million worth of gems, and diamonds,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.320
 and precious stones. - Wow.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.760
 - Hid them in some vacuum cleaner bags,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.360
 'cause you use what you've got,

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.040
 and like duct tape them to himself.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.840
 - Oh, he didn't accidentally suck them up,

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.680
 and then... (audience laughing)

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.720
 - That may have been his excuse in court, I don't know.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.920
 And he smuggled them out of the country,

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.800
 and I love this, the way he smuggled them out was,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.240
 he got them to Thailand by putting them

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.400
 in a big box of cargo, and then he knew

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.920
 that the Thai officials at the other end

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.280
 would check them at customs, unless he did something.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.040
 So he bribed them with an envelope,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.520
 stuffed with some cash, and with a note saying,

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.160
 "Hey, in my cargo, I've got loads of really bad porn,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.200
 and I'd really rather you didn't search it,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.760
 'cause that would be really awkward for me,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.840
 so can you not?"

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.680
 And they didn't.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.440
 - I really... - I would have thought

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.880
 you'd go for something slightly less tempting

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.440
 than that wouldn't you?

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.080
 - You're right, they're very respectful,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.840
 the Thai officials at customs.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.120
 Anyway, this year, finally, Saudi Arabia forgave Thailand,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.080
 'cause it became this huge diplomatic incident,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.400
 people were shot dead because of it.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.200
 - Yeah, there were lots of back and forth, yeah.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.600
 - Yeah, that's terrible.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.000
 - But the blue diamond's still missing,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.520
 so check under your seats before you go.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.360
 - It's not Oprah, we're not Oprah.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.560
 (audience laughing)

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.440
 - Just while we're talking about porn,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.400
 even though it was just a word,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.280
 I'm just gonna quickly grab that

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.120
 and bring it over here.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.120
 There was a news story which in Manhattan,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.240
 a congressional candidate called Mike Itkis,

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.040
 he's running and he has a sex positive approach

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.480
 as part of his campaign.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.760
 So he thought, "I'd like to demonstrate

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.560
 how positive I am about sex."

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.920
 He released a 13 minute long porn video with himself

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.120
 and a porn star that he filmed and put out

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.280
 to say, "I'm a man of my words."

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.000
 That's called Bucket List Bonanza

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.280
 and it's with Nicole Sage, the porn star.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.160
 And yeah.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.640
 - Sorry, what party is he from?

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.920
 - I would say wherever he is,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.360
 there's a bit of a party going on there.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.440
 There was someone called Alexandra Hunt

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.600
 who ran in the third district for Congress

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.880
 and she was a former exotic dancer.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.560
 But rather than hiding it, she decided to embrace it

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.360
 and one of her campaign slogans was just elect hose.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.720
 The other one said, "I may have danced for money,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.560
 but I'm no corporate whore."

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.240
 - Wow. - Isn't that good, isn't it?

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.480
 - Yeah, it's quite good, yeah.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.160
 - There was a guy in Nebraska, Bruce Bostleman,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.720
 who apologized for repeating the rumour

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.640
 that schools are accommodating children

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.800
 who self-identify as cats

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.520
 by putting litter trays in the corner of the classroom.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.960
 - Why are they putting litter trays in the corner?

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.080
 - Oh, no, they're not.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.360
 - All right, okay.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.800
 So the premise of his accusation is flawed.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.960
 - Yes, he accused them of doing something

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.280
 that definitely did not happen.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.120
 - Right.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.080
 - I've got a fact that was sent in by someone, actually,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.320
 like a couple of weeks ago.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.440
 Someone called Brain Blobs on Twitter,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.120
 so thank you, Brain Blobs.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.280
 This is a really thrilling thing, guys,

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.760
 so this doesn't sound thrilling,

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.320
 but there's been a general conference

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.360
 on weights and measures and some scientists,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.040
 no, stay with it, because some scientists

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.200
 from the National Physical Laboratory in the UK

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.320
 attended that conference on weights and measures.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.040
 And obviously, I don't need to tell you

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.400
 that that's the authority of the International Bureau

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.800
 of Weights and Measures.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.480
 And so, anyway, we've got some new units to celebrate,

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.320
 and that's really good.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.840
 So a measure of weight, a ronogram.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.880
 A ronogram is...

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.440
 - It sounds like it's someone's birthday.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.280
 (laughter)

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.720
 And you just send someone a run-around.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.560
 - Hello.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.400
 - What is it?

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.240
 - A run.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.560
 Happy birthday.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.800
 - Oh, that's so much better than what I've got here.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.720
 (laughter)

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.120
 So a ronogram is a one followed by 20 zeros, okay?

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.440
 And I think the earth weighs six ronograms,

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.280
 which is really good,

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.640
 'cause previously we had to say it weighs

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.640
 like 250 million blars,

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.680
 and even that was the previous biggest unit.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.520
 - Okay.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.360
 - So you see what I mean?

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.600
 Now we can just say it's six ronograms,

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.400
 and that's a much more convenient way of putting it.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.240
 - Great.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.080
 - Yeah, that's good.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.920
 - That's very handy.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.680
 Yeah, 'cause people often ask how much is the earth weigh,

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.040
 and you don't know any more units.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.480
 - Well, there's the ronometer.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.320
 - Oh, yeah.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.160
 - And the universe is--

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.560
 - It's how you measure runs, isn't it?

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.760
 (laughter)

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.720
 - The entire universe is just one ronometer across.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.560
 - What?

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.400
 - Oh, that's great.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.240
 - 'Cause it's very big, it's huge.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.080
 - You sound surprised,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.560
 but you haven't just heard that a ronogram is a large thing.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.400
 - It's massive.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.400
 - It's bigger than a gram.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.960
 - But I don't think that then helps you understand--

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.800
 - Okay.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.640
 - Anything.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.480
 - All right, Dan, okay, Dan.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.440
 No, no, no, that's fair enough.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.480
 All right, it's fair enough.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.960
 - Correct me if I'm wrong, it's an expanding universe.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.480
 - Well, eventually it'll be two ronometers.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.880
 - Okay, here's, okay, better example, better example.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.800
 The other end of the scale,

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.920
 they've added some very, very small things as well.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.760
 - Yeah.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.400
 - Right, so what about a quectogram?

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.240
 Okay?

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.080
 - Okay.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.200
 - There's a rontogram, which is the weight of an electron.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.120
 - Oh, this'll be the weight of a quark or something like that.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.360
 - Is the weight of something even,

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.200
 so the weight added to your phone

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.520
 if you get one extra byte of data on your phone.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.360
 - Oh, okay, right.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.560
 - That is one quectogram.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.840
 - Right, so that has actual weight?

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.680
 - Yeah.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.440
 - I swear to God, I emptied my phone

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.760
 some hours the other day, and...

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.400
 (audience laughing)

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.640
 - And it floated away.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.560
 - I'm not kidding, it felt so much lighter.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.760
 I was like, wow.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.600
 - Yeah.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.440
 - And so that's true.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.280
 - That's it, yeah, that's it.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.120
 - There we go, yeah.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.560
 - Do we think any of these are gonna come in handy

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.920
 at Weight Witchers' Meetings?

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.120
 (audience laughing)

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.200
 - Maybe, yeah.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.520
 - You've lost a rontogram this week, that really is, wow.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.200
 Well, actually on the Earth, an universe,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.720
 worrying news this year is that our days are getting longer

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.000
 and we don't really know why.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.320
 So there's this quite confusing thing

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.800
 where in the very, very long term,

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.720
 the days are getting slightly longer

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.080
 'cause the Earth's rotation is slowing

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.880
 'cause the moon's moving away from us.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.240
 That's over millions of years.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.280
 You don't need to worry about that.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.600
 But in the short term, like the last 50 years,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.600
 weirdly counterbalancing that,

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.200
 they've been getting shorter,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.440
 which we haven't really known why.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.000
 And now suddenly, the last couple of years,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.840
 they've gradually started getting longer,

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.200
 don't know if anyone's noticed here.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.040
 The extra--

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.080
 - It's felt like during Andy's tiny bit, actually.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.080
 (audience laughing)

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.520
 - So there's a new measure of time,

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.720
 the Andy Graham is, before.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.160
 - It's only a matter of minutes, but you will age.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.960
 (audience laughing)

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.120
 - But yeah, we think it might be

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.960
 because of the Chandler wobble.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.440
 (laughing)

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.280
 - The Chandler wobble.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.880
 - Could that be any more weird?

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.440
 (audience laughing)

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.800
 - Lovely, for someone who I know

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.320
 has never seen an episode of Friends.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.760
 (audience laughing)

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.640
 - Someone who's read the Wikipedia page of Friends.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.600
 (audience laughing)

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.960
 - Halfway through, I was thinking I'm out of my depth here.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.960
 (audience laughing)

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.840
 - Oh, you nailed it.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.420
 (upbeat music)

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:17.160
 - Do you know whose time on Earth has been made longer

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.640
 by one to two years, as of six months from now?

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.840
 - Oh, yes, I think, I mean,

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.520
 despite the way you phrase that, yeah.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.360
 (audience laughing)

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.520
 I think I actually do.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.920
 - So it's South Koreans.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.760
 - Right.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.760
 - South Koreans have just extended their life

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.160
 by one to two years,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.960
 and that's gonna happen between June of next year

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.560
 because they usually, in South Korea,

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.600
 the way that they measure your age is when you're born,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.240
 you were born one years old.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.640
 So they say that nine months is rounded up to

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.840
 12 months, you are one, and if you're born,

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.480
 I think it's like close to December,

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.360
 then you become two because it just is a new year.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.480
 So you go, you're two, quite quickly,

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.760
 if you're born in, let's say, November.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.320
 So that's been a thing where people have always found

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.640
 confusing if they go overseas,

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.840
 because their birth certificate or the passports,

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.400
 we all carry our birth certificates, right?

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.240
 (audience laughing)

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.280
 Their passport will say an age,

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.840
 but they'll say a different age,

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.880
 and it's really confusing.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.960
 So now South Korea has decided to abandon

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.480
 the whole thing of saying you're one or two when you're born,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.800
 and they're gonna be like the rest of the world's metric

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.640
 or I guess the majority.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.480
 - Are they?

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.320
 - Yeah, it's really sad.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.160
 It's a real shame.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.000
 - That's so sad.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.120
 - Well, I just think it's a cool, interesting thing to do.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.600
 - Yeah, it's an interesting cultural difference.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.760
 Yeah, don't do it, Korea.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.600
 Go back.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.640
 'Cause it would be cool if, as you claimed,

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.600
 they're adding two years to their life,

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.360
 and if that's how they've tricked them into it, then yeah.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.840
 - Oh, I think if I could, I'm 38,

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.120
 if I could be like, I'm now 36,

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.040
 I think that would make my day.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.960
 You wouldn't be, you would have--

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.480
 - You're still gonna die on the same day.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.320
 - Yeah.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.000
 (laughter)

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.840
 - Well, yeah, but--

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.160
 - And it's soon, sooner than you think.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.760
 - But I will have died two years younger.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.760
 - Also, people, more people will say, "Such a shame."

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.600
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.880
 - They were too soon.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.200
 - There were only 100,000 people older than Dan Shriver.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.920
 (laughter)

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.680
 - Can I drag us quickly back to sport?

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.520
 - Oh, yeah.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.360
 - Oh, yeah.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.280
 - And well, actually, one thing I just wanted to say

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.240
 about Southgate, which, go with Southgate.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.760
 - Sorry, yes, I'm not familiar.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.600
 I'd like to know a little bit.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.440
 - You were thinking the Tube station, weren't you?

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.840
 - I was actually thinking a scandal.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.680
 (laughter)

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.500
 - Southgate.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.640
 - Did you hear about Southgate?

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.400
 - So, football manager for England.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.440
 - England's football manager,

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.160
 and everyone thinks he's a really great guy now,

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.040
 so obviously he was the bad guy in the '90s

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.400
 because for international listeners,

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.240
 he missed a penalty at the Euros,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.680
 bit of a crisis for his popularity.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.560
 Everyone loves him now 'cause he wears waistcoats

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.160
 and England's a quite good team,

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.200
 but I found out how he met his wife,

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.560
 I mean, his ropey.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.080
 - Oh, what do you mean with ropes?

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.560
 (laughter)

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.120
 - It's actually not that bad,

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.640
 but he saw a woman he fancied who worked in a shop in Croydon,

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.000
 and so he, first of all, would like,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.840
 loiter around the shop pretending he was looking

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.680
 at the clothes there a lot to try and talk to her.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.520
 - What sort of shop?

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.360
 - Clothes shop, I reckon.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.200
 - Oh, yeah.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.440
 (laughter)

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.720
 - A hardware store, he gets picked up.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.360
 He's picking up padlocks and going,

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.200
 "I love this t-shirt."

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.000
 - "I love this high-vis jacket."

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.640
 (laughter)

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.040
 - Okay, sorry, so he's hanging around the shop.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:16.880
 - He's hanging around the shop.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.320
 He finds out she's got a very serious live-in boyfriend,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.080
 but it happens, he goes to a restaurant one day

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.680
 and her and her boyfriend are sitting nearby at the table,

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.920
 and he senses that they're having a bad time together.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.720
 He senses this relationship on the rocks,

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.400
 so when the boyfriend's not looking,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.920
 he sneaks over to her and drops a letter in her hand

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.760
 with his number on it.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.600
 - A letter?

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.760
 - A full review, yeah, yeah, 18 pages.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.120
 A note, I suppose a note,

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.880
 and saying, you know, when this cocks up,

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.040
 which clearly it's going to,

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.520
 why don't you give me a call?

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.360
 And she did.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.200
 - And she did.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.800
 - And they had their dates in Tesco Carpac for a long time,

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.440
 'cause they had to be secret, I think.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.640
 - Oh, so she hadn't left,

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.080
 they just started dating secretly?

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:58.960
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.760
 - Wow, this is a gossipy story, isn't it?

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.960
 (laughter)

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.840
 - A Tesco Carpac is not a very secret place, either.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.560
 It's actually open to anyone who wants to go there.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.960
 - I assume her boyfriend shopped at Sainsbury's.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess so, yeah.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.000
 - It's the only safe place for them.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.080
 Anyway, so that is some hot goss from 30 years ago.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:19.920
 - 30 years.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.920
 - About Gagasasky.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.320
 - Are they still together?

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.800
 - Yeah, the art's very sweet, actually.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.800
 - Oh, that's nice, well done, Gareth.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.520
 I got sports news here as well.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.560
 This is to do with the world of Badminton.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.400
 You'll all know this, I'm sure.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.440
 But just to remind you, four Chinese Badminton players

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.480
 were put on probation for two years this year

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.680
 after failing to try their best to win in 2018.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.600
 So the match happened in 2018, they finally had the thing.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.320
 Basically, the people that were watching the match

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.840
 noticed that either side were sort of not really giving it,

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.600
 they were just sort of like dicking about,

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.880
 and that apparently is illegal in Badminton.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.160
 - They did it for a very good strategic reason, right?

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.000
 - What, both sides?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.840
 - Yeah.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:02.680
 - Is it so they can play a different team

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.520
 in the next round?

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.480
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.320
 - I thought you were gonna say

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.000
 maybe they'd been paid to throw the match.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.600
 - No, I think it was because they,

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.440
 if whoever won would be playing the better team,

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.080
 and I believe it was two Chinese team, wasn't it?

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.280
 Who, if they won,

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.880
 were gonna end up playing the other Chinese team.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.480
 And so that was silly, 'cause they want China to win.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.480
 So it's pointless China playing China,

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.800
 'cause they're gonna knock one of them out.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.920
 - Right. - And so they all won,

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.560
 and then I think was the other one Korean.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.960
 - I don't know, apparently you know this way better than me.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.800
 - I'm just guessing.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.480
 I'm just like crystal ball.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.880
 Yeah, I think then the other team were like,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.440
 hang on, you're trying to lose.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.960
 We're gonna try and lose as well.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.240
 And then they got picked up,

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.320
 and then the second half they kind of went for it properly,

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.320
 'cause I think they realized we've been caught out.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.720
 - But now they're banned, yeah, for playing shit.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.560
 (laughing)

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.680
 Which is amazing.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.440
 - In 2024, the Olympics are gonna be in Paris.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.040
 This is the fact about next year, I should say.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.040
 Because this year they unveiled the mascot

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.080
 they're gonna have.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.840
 And everyone said the same thing,

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.040
 that it looks rather like a clitoris.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.600
 - Oh.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.000
 - The woman who designed it, when they said to her,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.120
 you know, it's a bit weird

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.040
 that your mascot looks like a clitoris.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.240
 She said, "I'm so happy after everything

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.840
 "that's happened with feminism,

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.520
 "that people can now recognize the clitoris."

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.760
 (laughing)

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.160
 - I saw the mascot, I didn't think it looked like,

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.640
 (laughing)

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.480
 I don't think at all.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.560
 - And they did find, I'm sure everyone saw this today,

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.800
 they found the snakes clitoris for the first time, haven't they?

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.640
 - Yeah.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.480
 - It's got two.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.320
 - It's got two.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.160
 - Two.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.320
 - Yeah, 'cause they have hemi-penis, don't they,

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.480
 like, double penises, so they have double clitorises as well.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.480
 - Oh, good for them.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.080
 (laughing)

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.280
 - I got a few records.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.120
 - Oh yeah.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.280
 - Do you want a little quiz?

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.120
 - Yeah.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.520
 - Okay, right, this record was broken in January.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.920
 By Laura Noonan of Sydney,

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.760
 it's the most cartoon characters identified in one minute.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.040
 How many?

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.040
 - 20.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:56.880
 - Okay.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.720
 - In one minute, 40.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.040
 - 106, come on.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.880
 - Wow.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.720
 - Imagine that.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.560
 - That's a lot.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.380
 - Yeah.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.040
 - How, identify what, like, by photos, or?

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:06.880
 (laughing)

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.800
 - I mean, yeah, some kind of pictorial.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.640
 (laughing)

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.480
 - I thought it was a voice, I guess.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.080
 - Oh, yeah, I thought a voice maybe.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.400
 - No, I think it was pictures, you know,

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.760
 Popeye, Betty Boop, Donald Duck, that one, you know.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.960
 - Question two, question two.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.880
 - All right, all right, all right.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.760
 February record, Franz Huber from Milan,

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.800
 most swords swallowed while hanging upside down.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.800
 - Okay, I've seen, I reckon,

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.480
 I've seen people swallowing around six or seven,

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.120
 so I'll go for that, six.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.320
 - Okay, one.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.160
 - 100.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.840
 (laughing)

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.680
 - Sorry, you didn't let me finish, 100.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.120
 (laughing)

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.680
 - You're both right, it's 100 swords.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.920
 No, of course it's not, it's nine.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.280
 - Oh, okay.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.720
 - Although, is that, if you're upside down,

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.800
 is it still swallowing or something?

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.640
 - Yes.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.900
 (laughing)

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.800
 - What is it, if it's not?

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.720
 - It's just like, it's just sort of

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.800
 pushing something up, isn't it?

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.080
 You know, swallowing is where you swallow something down

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.440
 and it goes into your stomach.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.680
 - It still ends up in your stomach though,

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.480
 no matter which way you're orientated.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.960
 - Yeah, I think you've forgotten the definition

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.800
 of the word swallow.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.640
 - Okay, well.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.300
 - You can't say, oh, I didn't swallow those diamonds,

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.840
 officer, because I was upside down at the time.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.800
 (laughing)

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.320
 - Please go on your way, sir.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.160
 (laughing)

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.160
 We legally can't arrest you.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.000
 Okay, fine, fine, fine.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:18.960
 All right, final one, final one.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.060
 March record, this is Miyabi Kugimachi of Tokyo,

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:27.020
 most socks sorted with one foot in one minute.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:27.860
 (laughing)

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.500
 And I want an answer in pairs, please.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.700
 How many pairs of socks sorted?

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.040
 - Half.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.880
 - Half of one pair?

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.800
 (laughing)

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.980
 James has low ball there.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.160
 - 30, 25.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.000
 - Pairs?

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.840
 - 400.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.680
 - 12 points.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.480
 - Four, again, 400 pairs of socks.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.000
 - I half listened to the question.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.760
 - Eight pairs of socks per second.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.900
 (laughing)

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.740
 - Final answer.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.000
 (laughing)

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.900
 - I don't know or care who got it right.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.340
 I think it was Anna, I think it was 15 pairs.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.420
 - You think?

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.300
 - No, no, no, I know, I just can't remember what everyone said.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.140
 - Oh, right, I know.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.980
 - I was so angry with you for guessing 400,

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.120
 but I kind of forgot Anna's answer.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.240
 I think you guessed sort of--

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.080
 - 25.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:08.920
 - 25.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.760
 - Oh, there we go.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.460
 - Yeah, but I meant singles, so 12.5, I thought.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.020
 (laughing)

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.220
 Wasn't this, I think I saw this,

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.340
 and wasn't she known on YouTube for foot-related content,

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.220
 anyway, I believe the person who won?

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.420
 (laughing)

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.220
 Or maybe I came across her in a different walk of my life,

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.060
 but--

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:24.900
 - Oh, right, okay.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.860
 - What is foot-related content?

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.820
 I know it means sexual stuff, but what does that mean?

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.100
 I actually don't know what that means.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.260
 Just sexy photos of feet?

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.540
 - I don't know, I guess it's sorting socks with your feet.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.380
 I don't know, I've never--

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.180
 - Sorting socks with your feet?

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.860
 - Yeah, well, that's what she's doing.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.660
 - That's what this lady was doing.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:40.860
 - I didn't hear the question.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.900
 (laughing)

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:47.100
 - Okay, I have a related fact on these kind of people.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.420
 It's about influencers who do strange things.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.260
 - Oh, okay.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.100
 - And this is Stephanie Matto, who sold farts in a jar.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.460
 - Oh, yeah.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.020
 - And she managed to get very, very sick

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.820
 because she was trying to fart too many times,

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.540
 'cause she got so many orders,

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.620
 she was trying to make as much as possible.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.100
 And what that meant, because I found another story

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.180
 in the same week, is that you can end up in hospital

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:14.100
 if you fart too much, and if you don't fart enough.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.980
 Because there was a woman called Cara Clark,

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.700
 who got extreme stomach pain

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.220
 when she'd been holding in her farts too much.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.500
 And then this influencer, Stephanie Matto,

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.140
 had been farting too much,

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.780
 and she ended up in hospital as well.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.500
 - Were they in the waiting room at the same time?

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.540
 (laughing)

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.940
 - Well, what that says to me is there's an optimum amount.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.780
 - Yeah, well, if you read the uncut version of Goldilocks,

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:39.540
 there is that scene where one of the bears in hospital--

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.020
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.740
 Why was the second woman holding in her farts?

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.940
 - Because she had a new boyfriend.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.260
 - Oh, no.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.620
 - Yeah, she's fine now, they had a laugh about it.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.700
 - Okay, that's pretty good.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.820
 - So what you're saying is we're all walking

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.220
 a kind of, quite a thick line of--

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.740
 - Yes, I think so.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.220
 But Stephanie has now retired from selling farts and jars.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.060
 You'll be glad to hear.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.220
 Her family are glad to hear.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.980
 But she is now selling her fart jars as NFTs.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:06.820
 - Okay.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.420
 (laughing)

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.420
 There's, can I mention one of the big stories of the year?

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:13.260
 - Yeah, go on.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.820
 - The very infamous Chris Rock Will Smith moment.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:17.660
 - Oh, yeah.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.020
 - The slap at the Oscars.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.060
 I fell in love with this story because it was just

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.780
 a very good example of how very quickly we all jumped

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.660
 to insane theories to sort of justify

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.820
 why it may have happened.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.380
 So there were two theories that came out immediately

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.340
 after it happened.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.340
 One was that someone said that the slap is much less

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.340
 interesting when you realize that Will Smith almost

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.940
 certainly went through the Scientology courses

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.700
 that tell you to unapologetically use slaps

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.260
 and physical force to let a fellow Scientologist know

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.500
 they've done something wrong.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.220
 So the idea is that in the training,

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.260
 they just go kwa-pang on the side of your face

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.460
 because they're bored or whatever.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.980
 And that's them letting you know that they don't want it.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.900
 - Can we introduce that to the podcast?

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.500
 - Please, please no, please no.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.620
 (laughing)

00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.600
 I won't last one.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.140
 - Tell us some more unit facts, Andy.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:02.980
 - Pow!

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.660
 (laughing)

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.420
 - But yeah, so but then Scientologists,

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.780
 including Ex-Scientologists,

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.140
 jumped to the immediately saying, no, no,

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:10.980
 that's not a thing.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.500
 My favorite one though of all the theories that came out

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.260
 is that someone noticed just before Will Smith

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.140
 came up to slap him on stage,

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:22.820
 that Chris Rock had dared to say the word Macbeth on stage,

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.180
 which you should never do.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.380
 The curse of Macbeth.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.700
 Oh, shit.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.780
 (laughing)

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.060
 - Anna, you know what to do.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.980
 - But so just a few moments before he congratulated

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.540
 Denzel Washington on his performance

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.140
 on the tragedy of Macbeth.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.660
 And so now if you go to the Wikipedia page

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.900
 for incidences after invoking the word Macbeth,

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.380
 you will find Will Smith slapping Chris Rock.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.180
 - But isn't that only a viable theory?

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.540
 And I can't remember his wife's name.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.500
 Maybe it is Macbeth.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.340
 - It's not Lady Macbeth.

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.460
 - But it's basically what Will Smith's wife

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.180
 would have to be called Macbeth.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.380
 'Cause I believe it was accompanied

00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:00.940
 with an explanatory words, wasn't it, by Will Smith?

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:01.860
 He didn't want to leave us in the dark.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.700
 Didn't he say get--

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.500
 - Keep my wife's name out of your mouth please.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.020
 - Oh, I see what you're saying.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:07.980
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.300
 And his wife's not called Macbeth.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.260
 So that's where that theory completely falls down.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.100
 But aside from that.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.420
 Well, that's the only reason he'd be annoyed

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.220
 about him saying Macbeth.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.180
 - No, the whole idea of the Macbeth curse

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.420
 is that it's out of your control what then happens.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.860
 So then he goes on to tell a joke

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.900
 he thinks is gonna be fine and the curse takes over there.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.860
 - Oh, you're not saying Will Smith was furious

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.020
 'cause he broke our rule.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:27.860
 - I thought that, yeah.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.860
 - The way you told it, it did sound like--

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:30.700
 - Was it Will Smith?

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:31.540
 - Oh, really?

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:32.380
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.220
 - The Scottish Blair, you dickhead.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.500
 Oh, the garb and tell him.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.080
 (upbeat music)

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:46.180
 - On celebrities, another celebrity of the year

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.660
 was Liz Truss.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.500
 - Mmm.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:52.140
 - And a chair of slight recognition in the room, wasn't it?

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.140
 - Can you just, for any international listeners,

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.260
 can you just say who?

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.820
 - Yes, so she was the short-lived,

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.540
 five minutes of fame Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:01.380
 - She still lives.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.220
 - She's still alive.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.060
 - She lives.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.380
 - Yeah, Liz Truss lives.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.540
 - She wasn't Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.260
 For God, how long was it, 37 days?

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.100
 - 49 days.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.460
 - 49 days, actually, that's not too bad, is it?

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.780
 (audience laughing)

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.660
 But she, I learned this year that she was often

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.300
 compared to Margaret Thatcher, obviously,

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.580
 because she tried to compare herself

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.220
 to Margaret Thatcher quite a lot,

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.220
 and she actually played Margaret Thatcher

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.780
 in a school play when she was eight years old.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.620
 - Oh, really?

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.500
 So what was the school play, Macbeth?

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.500
 (audience laughing)

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.780
 Like, I was in a couple of plays at school,

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.380
 and none of them featured a book without your character.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.700
 - It was a nativity.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.780
 - Nativity, yeah.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.060
 (audience laughing)

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:45.060
 - It was, the school play was the 1983 election, so.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.500
 (audience laughing)

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.820
 - Wow.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.820
 - It was a weird, they did things differently

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.620
 and paisley in the '80s.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:57.540
 I think that Thatcher election was going on at the time,

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.420
 and so they re-enacted it, and they asked people

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.940
 if they wanted to be certain candidates,

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.020
 and they said, would you like to be Margaret Thatcher

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.900
 and try to get people on your side,

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.540
 and then everyone would vote for who they liked best,

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.340
 who was pitching their political theories,

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.060
 and Liz Truss actually got zero votes,

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.820
 not even voting for herself.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:14.940
 (audience laughing)

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.500
 - Oh, because she was left-wing at the time,

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.620
 because her parents were quite left-wing,

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.500
 and she wouldn't have been a Thatcher supporter

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.180
 until much later, even at uni, she was in a damn.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.620
 - Yeah, that probably was it.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.140
 What she said was she knew the Tories

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.740
 were so unpopular and paisley at the time

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.900
 that she couldn't be seen voting for Margaret Thatcher,

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.020
 even though it was her in this instance.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.020
 - My school did the 1997 election,

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.820
 and it's a good, fun thing to do.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.140
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:38.980
 - Who did you play?

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:39.820
 - Chubb Prescott?

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:40.660
 - Well, we didn't do it as a play.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.500
 - Aw.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.340
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.460
 - Actually, Michael Gove wasn't around then.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.380
 (audience laughing)

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.700
 - Who were you?

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.540
 - I was-

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.380
 - I was-

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.220
 - No.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.060
 (audience laughing)

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.580
 We weren't playing individual people,

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:52.940
 it was just like it was done as like,

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.020
 I can't remember, there was a talk about it or something.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.140
 - You played people talking about the election.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.380
 - No, it wasn't a play, for fuck's sake.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.540
 (audience laughing)

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.380
 - It's not a play.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.220
 - It's not a play.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.040
 - It's not a play.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:03.880
 - We got to talk about the letters.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.720
 - The trust letters.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.380
 - The first letters, the letters that lasted longer

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.940
 than this trust, but of course there's a big argument

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.900
 between left and right on Twitter, like there always is,

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.860
 with the right-wing saying that actually

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.860
 there was some discoloration in the letters,

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:20.300
 and maybe it hadn't lasted as long as Liz Truss,

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.540
 but the Atlantic said that it was still usable in a salad.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.380
 (audience laughing)

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.220
 So that counts.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.300
 - Do you know what happened to it in the end?

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.580
 - Yeah, straight afterwards, for the next month,

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.860
 it was doing personalized messages on Cameo

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.700
 and it was 13 times.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.540
 (audience laughing)

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.380
 - Are you serious?

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.700
 - I'm serious, sorry, fine.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.300
 - That's really good.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.020
 - There was a really good quote about Boris Johnson

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.900
 in The Times this year.

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.020
 Boris Johnson for International List

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.020
 is another Prime Minister that we've had this year.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.380
 (audience laughing)

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.460
 This is around about the time when he was flying back

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.680
 from his holiday to claim the title of Prime Minister again

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.180
 and then decided against it.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.340
 And there was a school report written

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.940
 by one of his teachers when he was 18,

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.860
 and it was just so good and prescient.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.460
 So the school report said,

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:02.420
 "Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticized

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.380
 "for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility."

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.500
 (audience laughing)

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.020
 And surprised at the same time

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.140
 that he was not appointed captain of school for next term.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.740
 I think he honestly believes that it is churlish of us

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.020
 not to regard him as an exception,

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.620
 one who should be free of the network of obligation

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:20.180
 which binds everyone else.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.700
 (audience laughing)

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:22.540
 - All right.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.380
 - Cookie.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.200
 We were talking just before the show.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.880
 Do you guys remember the Sue Gray report?

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.260
 This time last year, that wasn't out yet.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.420
 That's all happened this year.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.260
 - Oh, wow.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.100
 - We're getting some nose over there.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.300
 So we're gonna have to refresh people.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.140
 - Nah.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.380
 (audience laughing)

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.700
 It's very boring.

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:40.260
 - Another Boris-like person, Chair Bolsonaro, in Brazil.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.660
 He's been away from the public eye

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.140
 for the last couple of months.

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.620
 And no one's really known what's happening.

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.420
 There's been a lot of rumors.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:47.540
 - What since the election?

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.380
 - 'Cause he lost, didn't he?

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.580
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:53.780
 The vice president said that he'd had COVID three times

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.660
 even though he denied it existed.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:56.820
 (audience laughing)

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.300
 And he had a skin disease

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.180
 which stopped him from being able to pot on his trousers.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.980
 (audience laughing)

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.820
 And so he couldn't do any public events.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:07.660
 - Oh, enough.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.260
 - You can still do Zoom calls, though, can't you?

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.260
 (audience laughing)

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.780
 - That's amazing.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.880
 - We should think of wrapping up in very,

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.340
 not just yet, but sooner.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:18.700
 - Can I say a science fact?

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:19.540
 - Yeah, of course.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.180
 - So one thing that we've just been getting this year,

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:22.420
 it's been in the works for years and years,

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.940
 the James Webb Space Telescope,

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.020
 which was launched, I think,

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.420
 at the very, very end of last year.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.420
 And we've just got the first photos back this year.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.820
 It's amazingly exciting,

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.700
 'cause we're seeing lots and lots of the universe

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.420
 in completely new ways.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.860
 And I've just been reading a bit about it.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.060
 It's so sensitive, the James Webb Space Telescope.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:43.020
 It could detect the warmth of a single bee

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.580
 that was on the moon from Earth.

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:47.420
 - Okay.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.260
 - Wow.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.100
 - Isn't that good?

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:49.940
 - Well, we don't have bees on the moon, though.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.780
 (audience laughing)

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.980
 - Well, maybe now we'll find out

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.540
 if we do have bees on the moon, then.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.380
 - Yeah.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.220
 - And do we?

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.040
 - Well, no.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:56.860
 (audience laughing)

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:57.700
 - That is quite amazing.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:58.880
 - Yeah, it's taking these pictures,

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.780
 they get called the baby pictures of the universe,

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.160
 because it's photographing light

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.380
 from 30 and a half billion years ago,

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:05.820
 really, really long time ago.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.300
 - So you can see what was happening

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.460
 just after the universe was spawned.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.300
 - Exactly.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.900
 Well, that made me think that all of our baby photos

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:15.900
 are still traveling out into space.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.000
 As in if you were far enough away,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.860
 you'd be able to see yourself as a baby,

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:20.940
 you know, what you were up to.

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:21.780
 - Yeah, as well.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.740
 - You'd be able to see your own baby photos happening.

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:23.580
 - I guess so.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.420
 - James, you're a physicist.

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.740
 - You'd have to be firing them out

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:26.580
 somehow.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.680
 Like, for instance, broadcast stuff.

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.520
 - Yeah.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.400
 - Something that's broadcast over the airwaves,

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.560
 that would go into space,

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:33.640
 and that could be seen for a long time.

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.800
 So technically, no such thing as the news is still on.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.200
 (audience laughing)

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.560
 We got cancelled on Earth,

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.200
 but if you're on Alpha Centurion,

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.680
 you can watch it live.

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.520
 - Oh, wow.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.960
 - Do you think the owner of,

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.640
 or the originator of the James Webb Space Telescope

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.840
 spams their friends on WhatsApp constantly

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.920
 with annoying photos of the baby universe?

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.920
 - Yeah, almost certainly.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.980
 (audience laughing)

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.100
 - Quite ugly, but they have to say something nice.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.540
 (audience laughing)

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.580
 - I've got a bit of a silly story here,

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:03.980
 which I just loved.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.700
 There's a guy in China, two guys in China,

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.980
 that were picking pine nuts from a tree recently,

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.660
 and the tree was a bit high,

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.460
 so they thought the way we'll get to it is,

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.700
 let's just fill up a hydrogen balloon,

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.020
 and we'll attach ourselves to that.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:16.900
 So they go up in it,

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.620
 and they're picking their pine nuts,

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.140
 but then the balloon becomes untethered.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.220
 One of the guys jumps out.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.860
 The other one's too afraid to.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.520
 And he disappeared for two days into the air.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.560
 (audience laughing)

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.880
 He went on a 200-mile-long journey,

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.840
 really high in the sky.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.400
 They were monitoring as he went.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.080
 Fortunately, he had his mobile phone,

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.560
 and he was constantly calling,

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.960
 and running low on battery, going, "What do I do?"

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.960
 And they had to navigate him to slowly let air out

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.400
 over somewhere that was landable,

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.640
 but for two days, he just fucked up, yeah.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.200
 - Wow, what an adventure.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.600
 - So funny, it's like up.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.800
 - So great, yeah.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.660
 - Have we got any last stories?

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:59.400
 - In Nigeria, they seized thousands of donkey penises

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.300
 because they were mislabeled as cow penises.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.580
 - Okay.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.820
 - There's a romance novelist who wrote an online essay

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.540
 called "How to Murder Your Husband",

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.180
 and she was sentenced to life for murdering her husband.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.260
 (audience laughing)

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.340
 - The old double bluff.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.440
 It doesn't always work.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.860
 - And according to a recent study

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.180
 at the University of Singapore,

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:21.740
 the three funniest word pairs in the English language

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:26.240
 are played by Parrot, Weasel, Penis, and Spam Skroton.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.440
 (audience laughing)

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.520
 - We'll try them in the next episode.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.840
 (audience laughing)

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.420
 (upbeat music)

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:39.320
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts from the year.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.640
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.400
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

 Check it out too.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.860
 Thank you very much Up The Creek

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.420
 for being here for our big end of year.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.780
 NoSearchThing is a new smash

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.740
 with the book of the year, Bonanza.

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.980
 And we'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:16.820
 We'll see you then.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.160
 Goodbye.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.160
 (audience cheering)

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.320
 (audience applauding)
