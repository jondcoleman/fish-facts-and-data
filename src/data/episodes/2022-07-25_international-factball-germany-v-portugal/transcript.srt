00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish Presents, The World Cup

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,060
 of Facts.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,520
 This is the only World Cup podcast out there that makes absolutely no mention of football

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,520
 whatsoever.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,020
 Brought to you by the QI elves and association with Visitingland.com.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,020
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:20,000
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anichesinski, and Andy Murray, and today's match is Germany

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,360
 versus Portugal.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,360
 Okay.

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,680
 I have some general words to kick off.

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,680
 Okay.

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,160
 It's a truchne ball verfa, which is someone who uses gloves to throw its nobles.

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,720
 Why would you need to use that word?

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,980
 It's like a weed, basically.

15
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:41,120
 Another word for weed is a voundusher, which is someone who has warm showers as opposed

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,400
 to icy cold showers in a Bavarian waterfall or something.

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
 Right.

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
 That's hot.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
 That's really good.

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
 Yeah.

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
 Do you know the word "Shatting Parker"?

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
 No.

23
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,920
 It's someone who parks a card in the shade.

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,840
 The Germans occasionally take English words into their language and they have an Anglicism

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,320
 of the Year competition.

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,760
 A couple of years ago, the best English words going to German was "Shit Storm" and last year,

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
 it was "Gate."

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
 "Gate?"

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
 Wow.

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,760
 As in "Watergate" or "Wall."

31
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
 I think it means "Gate."

32
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
 I think it means "Gate."

33
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
 Yeah, yeah.

34
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
 That's brilliant.

35
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,440
 We're taking in new words from different countries, they're actually eliminating words as

36
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,560
 well, one specifically, which is the longest word in the German language and a regional

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,960
 parliament has officially eliminated it.

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
 What is that word?

39
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,440
 I can't wait to hear you say it.

40
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
 It is.

41
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,840
 And that goes the rest of the podcast.

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:50,600
 I think we must put out something about meat.

43
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
 Yeah, it is.

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,200
 It's pertaining to the testing and labeling of beef.

45
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
 Nice.

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
 But it's gone now.

47
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
 It's out.

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
 They're done.

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,680
 But what about all the times you need to use the word that means pertaining to the testing

50
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,960
 and labeling of beef in everyday conversation?

51
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,600
 Well, what happened was that it was a law because of the BSE crisis, and so they didn't want

52
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,200
 the English beef to go in there.

53
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,720
 So they came up with this word that will explain about the testing of it, and then they repealed

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,800
 that law so they don't need it anymore.

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,240
 That's definitely a way to guarantee that BSE returns.

56
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,240
 It's saying, "Well, thank God that's all over.

57
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,400
 We don't need that word anymore."

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,040
 Let's give her the word Ebola, as well, it's asking for trouble.

59
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,120
 I'm moving a bit away from language.

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,120
 In 2008, I really like this, the German poet Friedrich Schiller, I was sent to reminders

61
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,640
 that he should pay his TV and radio license fee, which is fine, except that he's been dead

62
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
 for 200 years.

63
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
 Wow.

64
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
 Just about to say that.

65
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
 I wasn't really a TV watcher.

66
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,720
 Was Schiller the one who kept rotten fruit in his desk to help him write?

67
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
 Wow.

68
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
 That's cool.

69
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
 Why?

70
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
 What, eating it helped him write?

71
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
 No, it was a smell of it, I think.

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,760
 Or if he didn't write any, he had to eat some of the rotten fruit.

73
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
 It might not be Schiller.

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,760
 I'm not sure.

75
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,280
 That's a great fact of so, yeah.

76
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,280
 Germany meant to the Cuckoo Clock.

77
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,280
 Would you have always thought that was in Switzerland?

78
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
 Yeah.

79
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,600
 Yeah, the first Cuckoo clocks throughout the 17th century, all of the mentions of them were

80
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
 in Germany.

81
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,120
 That's a famous quote in a movie that all that Switzerland did was invented the Cuckoo

82
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
 Clock.

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
 That's what it is in the third man.

84
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
 The third man's wheel.

85
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
 And they don't even do that?

86
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
 Didn't even do that.

87
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
 What have you done, Switzerland?

88
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,120
 We'll find out if you're in the World Cup, are you?

89
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
 Best they are.

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
 Yes, they are.

91
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,960
 Should we have done a lot of other great stuff, we'll get to you.

92
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,720
 What I like about Germany is how they like to get naked.

93
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
 Yes, they do.

94
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,200
 They're real natureists, aren't they?

95
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,480
 Even right in the centre of Berlin and Munich, you'll find, yeah, nudists.

96
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,560
 I think it was the tear garden in Berlin.

97
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,040
 Well, one of the leaders of the naked culture movements in the 1920s was called Adolf

98
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
 Cuck.

99
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,240
 And he hadn't changed his name as a publicity, as a PR thing.

100
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,040
 It sounds like I made that up, didn't it?

101
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
 Yeah.

102
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
 No, no, he was called Adolf Cuck.

103
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,040
 He's a film and he's a determinism, it comes back and back.

104
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,960
 How would you guys tell the difference between East and West Berlin from space?

105
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,400
 I would, because the most he's still here, the area will be East.

106
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
 Because of...

107
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,600
 Oh, we smart.

108
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,080
 What if you're disoriented in space and you need to like orient yourself?

109
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,560
 So Chris Houdfield took a picture from space and...

110
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,800
 Chris Houdfield being the former captain of the International Space Station.

111
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,600
 Indeed, so he's on the International Space Station and he took a picture.

112
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,200
 And in East Berlin, it's yellow.

113
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,960
 It's got a yellow hue and in West Berlin, it's got a white hue.

114
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
 Wow.

115
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
 When it was...

116
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,520
 Back when it was separated from West Berlin, then they could only afford sodium.

117
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,840
 It was more budget-friendly to have these sodium lights and they could be yellow line.

118
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,840
 So it was really cool.

119
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
 That is a good fact.

120
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
 Yeah, it is quite cool if you look at the picture.

121
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
 Yeah.

122
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,080
 If I'm ever disoriented in space and can only see Berlin.

123
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
 (Laughter)

124
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,480
 Well, it's a foggy day in the rest of the world.

125
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
 It's a foggy day in the rest of the world.

126
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,800
 The reason you need to know which East.

127
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,840
 It's going to come in handy, I'm telling you, you'll thank me one day.

128
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
 Yeah.

129
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,960
 Remember the thing that they did when they had hyperinflation in Germany in the 1920s?

130
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,800
 Money wheelbarrows, that kind of thing.

131
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,520
 Yeah, the amount that money was going up and they had like 10 million mark notes and things like this.

132
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,440
 And it caused a problem called zero stroke and people would...

133
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,080
 Because they were seeing so many zeros and all that money and when they were paying bills,

134
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,600
 it was trillions and trillions of pounds.

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,000
 They became really confused when they were referring to numbers.

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,800
 And so people would say that they were 10 billion years old

137
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,000
 on the head 40 trillion children.

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 That's great.

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 That's very funny.

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I think it was started by Birthday Cundle and many fighters.

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 (Laughter)

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Okay, that's the halftime whistle there, Germany putting in a stellar performance.

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And now it's time for our halftime show,

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 which comes in the form of a quiz brought to you by VisitingLin.com.

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,800
 So we're going to start with James for the first question of this QI quiz.

146
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,400
 Okay, my question is, what could you not do in Frinton on C until the year 2000?

147
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
 Frinton on C.

148
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
 All right, Andy.

149
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,400
 My question is, which Disney character is buried in Graves and in Kent?

150
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
 What?

151
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,800
 Will it be Ariel? Will it be the Genie?

152
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
 Will it be Mickey Mouse?

153
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
 No guessing, no guessing.

154
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
 Is it one of Monsters Inc?

155
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
 No.

156
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,400
 (Laughter)

157
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
 Is it Simba?

158
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
 Ah, is it Boba Fett?

159
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
 Is it Lassie?

160
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
 No guessing, I'll tell you at the end.

161
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
 Okay, I reckon I know who it is.

162
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
 What? Do you know it, Dan?

163
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
 I think I got it.

164
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
 Yeah, you busted, mate.

165
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
 Okay, question number three, Anna.

166
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,400
 Why did the first Oxford University students not study the Aztec Empire?

167
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
 Dan's looking like you might know that one as well.

168
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
 Is it blue?

169
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
 (Laughter)

170
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,400
 Okay, well, if you want to find out the answers to these quiz questions,

171
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
 I certainly know that I do.

172
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
 The Disney character, I think I know it.

173
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,400
 Stay tuned to the end of the episode where we're going to reveal the answers,

174
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
 but now it's back to the match.

175
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
 Second half, Portugal.

176
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
 So what have we got, Portugal?

177
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,400
 Well, Portugal, biggest country in the world, pretty much in the 16th century.

178
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
 They owned so much of the planet.

179
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
 Wow.

180
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
 They would like the USA of the day.

181
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
 Wow.

182
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
 Who's like Brazil?

183
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,400
 Yeah, well, they had bits they had placed in Africa and placed in Asia

184
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
 and also in Brazil as well.

185
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
 And they were just an absolute world superpower.

186
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,400
 And they invented a lot of the food which we think of as being

187
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
 from that part of the world as not.

188
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,400
 So, for example, you think tempura is Japanese.

189
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
 It's Portuguese.

190
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
 It's Portuguese.

191
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
 Yes, yeah.

192
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
 Portuguese missionaries took it there in the 16th century,

193
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,400
 and then, you know, everyone now thinks it's a Japanese invention.

194
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
 Also, fin de lue is Portuguese.

195
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
 Is it?

196
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
 Yeah.

197
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,400
 Construing the Portuguese, dish, carne, davenia, da loss,

198
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,400
 which is a dish of meat usually parked with wine and garlic.

199
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,400
 So was that, that was in the 16th century that it was the biggest country in the world?

200
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
 Yeah, I would say so.

201
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,400
 I've got a football fact which I, yeah, I know, I know.

202
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,400
 I think it's quite interesting.

203
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,400
 The Portuguese team this year for the World Cup have six bodyguards

204
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
 for them, for now.

205
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
 Oh, really?

206
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
 Yeah.

207
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
 The two are for the rest.

208
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
 And the other two are just reserves.

209
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,400
 In the last couple of days, they've called him the most remarkable footballer in the world.

210
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
 Above Beckham.

211
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
 Yeah.

212
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
 Well, Beckham doesn't play in the world.

213
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
 Otherwise, this is not the football podcast please.

214
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
 Oh, sorry.

215
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
 Yeah, sorry.

216
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
 Sorry.

217
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,400
 Andy, why don't you bring us back to something non-foborrelated?

218
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
 Okay.

219
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,400
 In 1974, Portugal's entry to the Eurovision Song Contest was used as the signal to start a revolution.

220
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
 Wow.

221
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,400
 Which is probably the most significant Eurovision Song of all time.

222
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
 The song was called a de poido adios.

223
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,400
 And it was used as the signal to start the carnation revolution.

224
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
 It was basically, let's go.

225
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
 Let's start fighting.

226
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
 Yeah.

227
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,400
 It's bizarre between 1910 and 1926.

228
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,400
 Portugal had 44 governments, 20 military takeovers and 12 presidents.

229
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
 I read a thing about a Christmas tradition of theirs.

230
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,400
 And it's not only done in Portugal, it's a few other places.

231
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,400
 During Christmas time, they like to build a model village of Bethlehem.

232
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
 Like a Nativity scene.

233
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
 I'm Nativity scene.

234
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,400
 So they have a model village, basically, of the Nativity scene.

235
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,400
 But there's an extra character who joins in into this scene.

236
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,400
 So you have Mary Joseph, baby Jesus, and a guy who's called a Kaganah,

237
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,400
 which roughly translates in English as shitter.

238
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,400
 And the shitter is a little figurine that it's traditionally a man that's placed into this scene.

239
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,400
 And he's in the act of defecating, his pants around his knees.

240
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,400
 He's bending over with a pile of feces at his heels.

241
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,400
 And he's usually placed in the corner, probably because he needs privacy.

242
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,400
 But if anyone wants to Google this, why is he there?

243
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
 I'm not sure.

244
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,400
 They do that in the bass country as well, I think, and in Spain.

245
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
 And in Spain.

246
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,400
 And then sometimes they will get a famous person's face for the little boys.

247
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
 So they might have David Beckham or Cristiano Ronaldo or something like that.

248
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
 What for, baby Jesus?

249
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,400
 What would be terrible for the Kaganah?

250
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
 And terrifying as well.

251
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,400
 If it was Ronaldo, they would have four bodyguards around him.

252
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,400
 What do you think the wise men are allowed to approach?

253
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
 Three henchmen.

254
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,400
 Just very quickly, because you're saying they do this in Spain as well.

255
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,400
 One way of getting into Spain from Portugal is by a zip line.

256
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,400
 It's the only country in the world where you can cross the border via the zip line.

257
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
 It takes less than a minute to travel the whole thing.

258
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
 It's 20.

259
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,400
 Is that including the stop for your passport check along the way?

260
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:26,400
 There's another guy on the zip line next to you who's checking your passport as you go.

261
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,400
 And it's, yeah, it's 2,300 feet long.

262
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,400
 You zip line into a new country.

263
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
 That is fantastic.

264
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
 Does anyone want to include anything else?

265
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:43,400
 The film "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" in Portugal was renamed a nice pair of dot, dot, dot roll escapes.

266
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,400
 I don't know why I haven't seen the film.

267
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,400
 That is the worst name for a film I have ever heard.

268
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,400
 Or the worst euphemism rests I've ever heard.

269
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
 I have one more tiny nugget back to that sample.

270
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:01,400
 The most important Portuguese export is Cork. It accounts for its exports account for 70% of the world's Cork.

271
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,400
 And Cork sales represents 16% of its trade income.

272
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
 Which is a lot.

273
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
 Wow, yeah.

274
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
 Florian, because of all the synthetic corks.

275
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
 I know. They're really in trouble.

276
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
 Okay, that's it. That's full time. That's the end of our match.

277
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:21,400
 But before we find out who has won today's bout, we're going to get the answers to our visitingland.com.

278
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,400
 QI quiz questions that we're at the halftime match. So we're going to start with James.

279
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,400
 Okay, the thing that you couldn't do in Frinton on C until the year 2000 was visit a pub.

280
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:38,400
 The charter explicitly forbade the opening of pubs in Frinton because they didn't want to attract the wrong sort of resident.

281
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
 Okay, question number two, Andy.

282
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
 Do you want to have a guess?

283
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
 Yeah, I do.

284
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
 Have a guess.

285
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
 But can you repeat the question for us?

286
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,400
 It's which Disney character is buried in Gravesend in Kent.

287
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,400
 Okay, so I have two options that I want to throw up. Go on.

288
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,400
 The first one is John Smith. No, the second one is Pocahontas.

289
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
 Yes, it's Pocahontas.

290
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
 Is it Pocahontas?

291
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
 Yeah, because she came back, didn't she?

292
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
 They ended the movie as if she just stuck out there waving goodbye.

293
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
 I know.

294
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
 No, she went back.

295
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,400
 No, someone obviously hasn't seen Pocahontas 2 where she comes back and marries the man who she actually did marry rather than John Smith.

296
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
 That's true. She didn't end up with John Smith.

297
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
 Yeah, but it's all in Pocahontas 2. Watch the sequence.

298
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
 I didn't even know there was Pocahontas 2.

299
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,400
 Pocahontas 3 is a bit dull. It's just her rotting in the ground.

300
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
 Yeah.

301
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
 Yeah.

302
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
 Okay.

303
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,400
 Question number 3, and that is Anna Chazinski.

304
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:33,400
 Yeah, the reason that the first Oxford University students didn't study the Aztec Empire was because the Aztec Empire wouldn't exist for more than another 300 years.

305
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
 That is a great fact.

306
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,400
 Okay, well, there we go. Those are our three answers.

307
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,400
 If you were playing but thought damn it, that would have been good if there was a prize. I got some of those right.

308
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,400
 Why don't you head over to Visitingland.com where there is an actual prize that you can win.

309
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,400
 QI goodies, signed books by the elves and so on, and yeah, have a bash. You might win something.

310
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,400
 Anyway, we're going to find out who the winner now of our match today was, and that was Germany versus Portugal,

311
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
 and we're going to go to James to make the decision.

312
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:05,400
 Okay, I am going to vote with my stomach and go with Portugal because of their Vindaloo and Tempora.

313
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
 Okay, so that's it for this match. I hope you enjoyed it.

314
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,400
 We're going to be back again tomorrow with another brilliant bout between two nations, and they are James.

315
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,400
 They will be Belgium and Algeria. Belgium and Algeria.

316
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,400
 Nice. Okay, if you want to ask us anything about the things that we were talking about in this podcast,

317
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:27,400
 maybe dispute James's stomach, you can get us on our Twitter handles. I'm on @Streiberland. James.

318
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,400
 @Xshaped. Andy. @I'm Drew Hunter M. Adder.

319
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
 You can get me on @Quickipedia.

320
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,400
 @Quickipedia. Okay. And we'll see you again tomorrow for the next match. Good bye.

321
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,560
 next match, goodbye.

322
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:46,760
