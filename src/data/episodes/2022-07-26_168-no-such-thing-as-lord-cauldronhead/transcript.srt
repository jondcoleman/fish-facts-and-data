00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,040
 [nodding sound]

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,020
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,560
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden also coming to you from the morning

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,720
 after the 2017 British General Election.

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,920
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,220
 I'm sitting here with Ani Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter Murray.

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,320
 Andrew Hunter Murray, so I'm tired.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,160
 Andrew Hunter.

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,560
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,760
 I'm sitting here with Ani Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter Murray.

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,400
 from the last night, the evening of the election.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,640
 And in no particular order, here we go.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,560
 Hey Dan, you sound a bit tired.

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,400
 I'm very tired.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,400
 But which one of us stayed up the latest and the longest?

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,880
 Well, the problem was, I didn't watch it on TV.

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,480
 I think all of us stayed watching it on TV.

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,480
 We made the mistake of watching it on plus one, so you got even less sleep than the rest of us.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,640
 We watched it on my iPhone in bed with the lights off.

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,280
 My left eye, which did all the watching, because my right eye was in a pillow, is really

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
 twitching right now.

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,520
 But because it's on the left, it'll be very happy with the results.

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,320
 Okay, starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,800
 Yeah, my fact is the really relevant to this result fact, all forfeited election deposits

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,280
 go straight to the queen.

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,800
 And this is just the thing I found out.

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,380
 I was reading the Electoral Commission Guide for Returning Officers, as you do in an exciting

29
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,380
 time like this.

30
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,320
 You've got to do exciting things.

31
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,240
 And yeah, there was just a rule in it.

32
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,560
 It's like for returning officers.

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,200
 So for anyone, internationally listening returning officers are the people who are responsible

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,080
 in every constituency for like, organising and announcing the election.

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,440
 And this is the long guide, as to exactly how they go about doing that.

36
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,160
 What it says in the guide is, if a candidate does not poll more than 5% of the total number

37
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,080
 of valid votes cast, that deposit will be forfeited, you must send any forfeited deposits

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
 to her majesty.

39
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,760
 So the deposits are £500, that people put up if they want to be an MP, again for international

40
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
 listeners.

41
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,160
 And then if you get under 5%, you fall for the deposit, but I didn't realise it went

42
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
 to her majesty.

43
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160
 I can't find anything else about this online.

44
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
 It's amazing though.

45
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,120
 In 2010, you kept alone lost £229,000 in deposits.

46
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
 No way.

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
 Wow.

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
 And the green party lost £163,500.

49
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
 Of course it is.

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
 No wonder the Queen's so rich.

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
 Yeah, no.

52
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,120
 In 2010, there was about a million pounds in lost deposits.

53
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
 That is a lot.

54
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
 It is a lot.

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
 Wow.

56
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,640
 The idea of this deposit is to stop frivolous campaigns, isn't it?

57
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,640
 Yeah, but it does a very good job.

58
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,960
 I think the Monterey from Looney Party would agree.

59
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,120
 In 1983, they had a look at this, the Home Affairs Committee to see if it was, you know,

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,560
 if it was too much and if it was stopping poorer people from running.

61
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,480
 And they kind of thought, well, maybe it is, but actually it's worth it because for your

62
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,960
 500 quid, even if you lose, you get free postage for your campaign address and you get free

63
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,760
 use of buildings for public meetings and you get a great deal of publicity, they said.

64
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,960
 So almost the 500 quid is worth it.

65
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,400
 And they actually recommended it should be up to £1,000.

66
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
 Oh, really?

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
 But it never was.

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,120
 Well, I might just enter a not even campaign just for the sake of getting some publicity

69
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,680
 for myself and some free buildings.

70
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,200
 We're going to enter you, weren't we?

71
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,200
 Because you live in the same constituency as Jeremy Corbyn, but he did quite well in the

72
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
 swan didn't he?

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
 So you could have swung it out.

74
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
 I could have.

75
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,080
 Are they saying that he did the best that any politician has ever done?

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,080
 He got the highest.

77
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,720
 He didn't, he didn't win at the election, but in his constituency.

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,160
 Yeah, he got the highest ever vote in isn't enough.

79
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
 Wow.

80
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
 Which is the smallest constituency.

81
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
 I didn't know.

82
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
 It's also mine.

83
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
 So I had a personal interest in that.

84
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,160
 Really?

85
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,160
 Yeah.

86
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
 It's a smallest package.

87
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,600
 Do you know what the largest one is?

88
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
 No, what?

89
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,960
 It's Ross, Sky and Lock Arbor in Scotland, which is 1,632 times larger than Islington North.

90
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
 Really?

91
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
 Yeah, huh.

92
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,560
 And so I worked that out and I worked out that if Jeremy Corbyn's allotment was increased

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,200
 by that amount, then it would be the size of the Vatican city.

94
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
 Wow.

95
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,800
 Maybe it will be now.

96
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,720
 Just on the Queen very quickly, so overseas listeners might not know this, but the Queen's

97
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,560
 not allowed to vote in these elections.

98
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
 She is allowed to vote.

99
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
 Of course she just doesn't.

100
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,400
 Sorry, she chooses not to, and every, every one of...

101
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
 She doesn't care.

102
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
 But these are real problems in this country.

103
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
 It goes right up to the top.

104
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
 Right?

105
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
 Because she's old.

106
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
 You know, you'd think she would care more.

107
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,400
 Of course, she doesn't want the votes to go higher, because she wants this delicious money

108
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
 from the last department.

109
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
 Exactly.

110
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
 But also...

111
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,040
 So sorry, you've just got 4.999% of the vote in the constituency.

112
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,400
 See the Queen going, yes.

113
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:58,080
 But she spends most of her time in these periods, and for the referendum and so on, just denying

114
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
 that she has an opinion, which I love.

115
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,120
 Every single royal member just seems to spend their whole period any time they're mentioned

116
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,920
 in the press in these periods, denying that what they've said is, in some way, alluding

117
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,080
 to an opinion about what way people should vote for it.

118
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,920
 But they can have opinions on things like catch up or mayonnaise, or, you know, do you

119
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,520
 prefer a buzzcut or long hair?

120
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,120
 They're just not supposed to have political views.

121
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
 Yes, no, exactly.

122
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
 But not any opinion.

123
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
 I've obviously been...

124
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,640
 Have you heard of Prince Charles?

125
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
 Consistently raised to everyone who will...

126
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,440
 He has been leaked, aren't they?

127
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,080
 He hasn't openly done that.

128
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
 He doesn't know that.

129
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,280
 That reminds me of the Emperor of Japan, Akihito, who's not allowed to give any opinions

130
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,200
 on politics at all, not even just in elections, just never ever, and it's in the constitution

131
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,360
 that comes from the end of the Second World War.

132
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,840
 And so he wasn't allowed to abdicate.

133
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,680
 He wasn't allowed to say, "I want to abdicate," he had to kind of do an announcement alluding

134
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,100
 to the fact that he might want to, and then people had to kind of infer from what he said

135
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,100
 that he wanted to abdicate.

136
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,100
 So, wink, wink.

137
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,100
 That stuff, wow.

138
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
 Pretty tight.

139
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
 You didn't...

140
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,180
 You may have not seen that in the news last night, but they passed that he is now allowed

141
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,180
 to abdicate.

142
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,180
 Oh, really?

143
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,180
 Yeah, yeah.

144
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,180
 I was in the news last night, hope.

145
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,180
 Oh, I didn't see that.

146
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,180
 Yeah.

147
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,880
 But on, like, process, weird election, an electoral process, if it's a tie, it comes down to a coin

148
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,800
 to us, which obviously never happens, but there was that guy in Anne's constituency, so one

149
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,600
 of our colleagues Anne used to live up North, and it's in North East 5, and I think the person

150
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,620
 who won was an S.M.P candidate who won by two votes this morning, right?

151
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,620
 Yeah.

152
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,620
 Wow.

153
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,620
 Two votes.

154
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,620
 Wow.

155
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,620
 Oh, my God.

156
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,620
 So that's just one person, isn't it?

157
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,620
 Yeah.

158
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,620
 Putting the X in the wrong body.

159
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,620
 Exactly.

160
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,620
 Did you guys see the Green Party candidate from...

161
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,620
 Ashfield?

162
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,620
 No.

163
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,940
 Okay, so his name's Aaron Rangy.

164
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:48,500
 He had to leave the count as it was going on because he had to get home to get some sleep

165
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,220
 because he has an A-level history exam at nine o'clock this morning, so he's 18 years

166
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,220
 old.

167
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,900
 He's the Green Party candidate, and it just got too late for him, so I can't stay for the

168
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,900
 final count.

169
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,900
 Got my exam.

170
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,940
 They should let you off having a history exam if you're making history.

171
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,940
 Yes.

172
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,940
 I'll see definitely did in the Green Party.

173
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,940
 Yeah.

174
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,780
 Yeah, I'd take it he won the seat presumably, right?

175
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,780
 I have no idea.

176
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,820
 No, I mean, he didn't win the seat.

177
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,820
 Okay.

178
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,420
 You know the deposit thing that we were starting off with, did you know it used to be a lot

179
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,420
 harder?

180
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:27,180
 So, until I think 1918, or definitely in 1918, it was £150 that you had to put up, but

181
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,460
 obviously that was a lot more money then.

182
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,460
 Yeah.

183
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,460
 It was about...

184
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,460
 Yeah.

185
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:38,420
 And you had to win 12.5% of the vote, otherwise you would forfeit your deposit, so it was a much

186
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,420
 higher barrier.

187
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:45,620
 Another place you need to get 12.5% is in Japan, and do you know how much the Japanese deposit

188
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,820
 is that you have to pay?

189
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,820
 No.

190
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:55,300
 It's 3 million yen, which is the equivalent of £21,064, and you need 12.5%.

191
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,700
 But then they don't get all those hilarious fringe candidates that can entertain them during

192
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,100
 a tedious campaign, right?

193
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,420
 I suppose not, unless they're extremely rich.

194
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,580
 Very wealthy ones.

195
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,580
 Yeah.

196
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,460
 Just another thing on, on process.

197
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,460
 If you...

198
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,820
 I really think, I think process was a big winner in this election, don't you?

199
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,140
 It was certainly what I voted for, I just wrote it in my box.

200
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,820
 I love that I'm doing this, the way I'm doing it.

201
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,980
 So I didn't realise that actually, as long as you make your intention clear on the ballot

202
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,980
 paper, then your vote counts, so I thought you had to do a cross or maybe a tick.

203
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:35,220
 But if you draw a penis, as long as it's within the lines of the candidate in whose box

204
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,060
 you've drawn a penis, it does count as a vote.

205
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,860
 And so there was, for instance, there was a Tory MP, Glenn Davis in 2015, who held onto

206
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,340
 the Montgomeryshire constituency in Wales, and he personally thanked the person who voted

207
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,740
 for him by drawing a penis in his box.

208
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,900
 But it sort of depends how you feel about penises, doesn't it?

209
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,900
 You're right.

210
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
 So do you think...

211
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,260
 When people call you a dick, Andy, do you look at them and think, "Yeah, but he probably

212
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,260
 likes dick."

213
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:12,740
 Actually, on that spoiling vote thing, in the last British election 2015, there were 97,870

214
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,980
 spoiled votes, right?

215
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,820
 The last time the Gambia had an election, there were two really spoiled ballots in the whole

216
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
 country.

217
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,820
 What?

218
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,740
 Because the Gambian voting system is really cool.

219
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,500
 If you've got three candidates, you have three buckets next to each other, you've got

220
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,300
 three barrels next to each other, and they've got a little shoot at the top, and you push...

221
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,020
 You get given a marble, and you push the marble through the little shoot at the top, and

222
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,060
 it dings a bell, so everyone can hear it.

223
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,220
 So how do you spoil your vote?

224
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,220
 Now, do you put your penis in there?

225
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,860
 To spoil your vote.

226
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,220
 You have to balance a marble on top of the barrel, and only two people did it in the whole

227
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,220
 country.

228
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,220
 No, that's a fraction.

229
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,220
 Yeah, what?

230
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,220
 You kidding?

231
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,220
 That's incredible.

232
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,220
 It's a great system.

233
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,220
 They've had the system since the '60s.

234
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,220
 It really works for them.

235
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,740
 If you spoil your ballot by putting your penis in the tube, then the electoral guy comes

236
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,700
 along and goes, "Do you like penises, though?"

237
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,700
 The bell keeps going, "Ling-ling-ling-ling-ling."

238
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,220
 That's actually more akin to the word ballot, isn't it, because ballot comes from, I think,

239
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,500
 a word that means little ball, because it used to be that you actually put a ball into

240
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
 a box.

241
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
 That's right.

242
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
 I think so.

243
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
 We can start thinking about moving on.

244
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
 Yeah, shall we?

245
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
 What should we move on?

246
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,660
 That's a lot more stuff to say, one process, I know.

247
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,420
 So much process.

248
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,420
 I do like the first ballot box.

249
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,420
 It's just got more presents.

250
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,300
 I know you said it in just, that's really hoping to move on.

251
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,700
 Look, this is a great fact, guys.

252
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,220
 It's not all about this election.

253
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,500
 The first ever secret ballot when it was introduced in the UK was in 1872, and the seal

254
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,580
 of the first ballot box was made with a licorice stamp, so there are famous licorices

255
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,580
 in the UK that are called Pontifract Licorices, and they're like black sweets, and they have

256
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,300
 a stamp on them, which says Pontifract Licorice has a picture of Pontifract Castle, and when

257
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,980
 they had to close the first ballot box in 1872, they had to whip one over.

258
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,300
 It was in Pontifract, so they got one of those stamps over from Pontifract, and they stamped

259
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,300
 it with a licorice stamp, so...

260
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,300
 That's really cool.

261
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
 That's very cool.

262
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,300
 ...liquish logo on it.

263
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
 That's a good process.

264
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,300
 Great process, guys.

265
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:25,900
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

266
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:32,660
 My fact this week is that only one political party in this 2017 election offered to do anything

267
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,660
 about yetis.

268
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,180
 Oh, did they get your votes?

269
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,180
 I didn't.

270
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,500
 I've only found out about it too late.

271
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
 Yeah.

272
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
 What's the party?

273
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,020
 The party goes by a number of names, actually.

274
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,740
 It's sort of formally, as its main headline name known as "Church of the militant Elvis Party."

275
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,180
 It's also known as the "Buspass Elvis Party."

276
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,780
 Oh, yeah, those ones.

277
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,620
 This year they ran under the title "Elvis" and the Yeti Himalayan Preservation Party.

278
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,620
 So there is a common theme that runs through their names, isn't it?

279
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,620
 Yes.

280
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,620
 Party.

281
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,620
 Yes.

282
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,620
 Yeah.

283
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:13,360
 Yeah, so the guy who was running is a guy called David Bishop, aka Lord Biro, and he was

284
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,780
 promising this year that if they were voted in that he would do stuff about the potential

285
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:23,080
 threats from North Korea and launching missiles, because if they miss-launched missile in

286
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,080
 the wrong direction, it might hit Tibet and harm Yetis.

287
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,760
 So that was his protection policy that he wants to get in on.

288
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,720
 And he actually was stepping down.

289
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,800
 He said he was going to step down completely and then did his own personal eutern on it

290
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,940
 because Theresa May called a general election when he thought I'm not going to be in

291
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,620
 a fit state in a few years to come.

292
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,060
 But then he said when he heard that Mick Jagger was going on tour again this autumn, he thought,

293
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,500
 OK, I can run to.

294
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:57,060
 And so actually this snap election has been bad news for these kind of slightly unusual candidates.

295
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,100
 They've not been really able to organize things very quickly.

296
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,420
 There was a guy who had the rebooting democracy party.

297
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,300
 He's standing in Cambridge and he's got this idea that he wants to change democracy, make

298
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,860
 it more direct.

299
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,560
 He wanted to fight all 650 seats in the election, but due to the snap election, he was only

300
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,860
 able to get into one.

301
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:24,540
 But his idea is to go into sortition, which is basically that everyone randomly gets chosen

302
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,460
 as an MP.

303
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,300
 So rather than people becoming career MPs and deciding they want to work their way up into

304
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,220
 Parliament, you basically, it's like jury-duty, you get chosen.

305
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,740
 And they did that in ancient Greece.

306
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,740
 It's called air-sortition.

307
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,740
 Right.

308
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,740
 There's quite an old type of democracy.

309
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,860
 So they put all our names in a hat and then they just pick it out.

310
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,740
 Just pick it out and they go, you're an MP.

311
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
 Great.

312
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,740
 And did that go well for ancient Greece?

313
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,740
 Are they still doing that today?

314
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
 Yeah.

315
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,780
 The reason is it's called ancient Greece.

316
00:13:53,780 --> 00:14:04,380
 This guy, Lord Biro, he actually 2014 in a by-election in Nottingham, he got 67 votes.

317
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:10,220
 One of his campaign promises were that he was going to try and get OAPs, a 30% discount

318
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,060
 at brothels.

319
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,060
 He got more votes in that by-election than the Lib Dems.

320
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,660
 Is it possible that they misheard and thought he was talking about Brussels?

321
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,860
 Because brothels bureaucracy is what we need to stand up.

322
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,340
 Well, here's the other thing you might have liked him, actually Andy, because one of

323
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,340
 his other--

324
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,220
 I'm getting on.

325
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:40,180
 One of his other policies was that he wanted to protect public toilets from being wiped out.

326
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,620
 So why does that be like public toilets?

327
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,740
 I just remember, ages ago, we were talking about public toilets, and you had a big thing

328
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,180
 about your fury of the high-street public toilet being wiped out.

329
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,180
 Well, a lot of them have been cut, and yeah, and it is a substantial problem for people.

330
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,420
 If you're trying to get around, you need to access to a public toilet as loads of people

331
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,460
 do, and you don't want to go into a restaurant or a cafe or something, because often they're

332
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,260
 snippy about letting you use their lose.

333
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,260
 And it's a massive problem.

334
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,260
 That's actually a problem.

335
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,260
 Exactly.

336
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,740
 And the fact that you have to pay for it a lot as well.

337
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,740
 Exactly.

338
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,460
 So in some American cities, they have laws, I think, now that you're not allowed to charge

339
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,380
 for going to the toilet, or at least they're trying to get them in.

340
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,380
 Yeah.

341
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,380
 So it is a big, big surface.

342
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,380
 It is.

343
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,380
 And Lord Murrow's on the case.

344
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,380
 Lord has been talking about it.

345
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,380
 This whole campaign.

346
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,380
 It's not been Brexit.

347
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,380
 Brexit.

348
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,380
 Process.

349
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,380
 Process.

350
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,380
 Brussels.

351
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,380
 Brussels.

352
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
 Brussels.

353
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,380
 These weird candidates.

354
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,380
 Yeah.

355
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,620
 So Lord Buckethead has been a big character in the election.

356
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,620
 He's incredible.

357
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,220
 He or someone dressed like him has been standing on and off since 1987.

358
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,220
 No.

359
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,220
 Yeah.

360
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,700
 He first stood against Thatcher.

361
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
 Yeah.

362
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,820
 And he stood against Thatcher in 1987 with a promise to destroy Birmingham and replace it

363
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
 with a starbase.

364
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,420
 And he stood in this election saying we should defer the decision on whether to destroy

365
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:58,060
 Birmingham and replace it with a starbase until 2022, at least.

366
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,580
 So you were implying there, I think, that perhaps it's not the same Mr. Buckethead every,

367
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
 is it like Dr. Who?

368
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,580
 He kind of regenerates.

369
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,580
 I think it might be.

370
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
 Yeah.

371
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,580
 There's a chance.

372
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,580
 Isn't that said?

373
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,380
 They should have had more than one Darth Vader.

374
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,100
 You know, like send, you know, what?

375
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,300
 Just like, you know, there was only ever one Darth Vader, but you could just put another guy

376
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,300
 in there for like minor battles.

377
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,300
 That's very mask.

378
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,300
 Yeah.

379
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
 I guess so.

380
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,300
 Yeah.

381
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,020
 Why was they know like duplicate expendable Darth Vader?

382
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,020
 Yeah.

383
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,020
 Yeah.

384
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,020
 Yeah.

385
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:34,540
 It was from Lord Buckethead this morning, 249, a new Buckethead record, something to celebrate

386
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,540
 eh?

387
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,140
 It's so funny watching him.

388
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,500
 I mean, it was already a horrible moment for Theresa May, I think, by that point, when she

389
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,900
 was standing there and what, and he was directly behind her.

390
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,900
 Was it all he was?

391
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,500
 Oh no, actually, he was up quite on the edge.

392
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
 Yeah, he was.

393
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,900
 It wasn't as bad as Tim Farron, because he had Mr. Fishfinger stood behind him.

394
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,900
 Tim Farron, that was it.

395
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,900
 Yeah.

396
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,100
 Okay, let's explain this for overseas listeners who wrote this.

397
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,260
 Okay, so like Dan says, we do have these very odd fringe candidates and some of them like

398
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,260
 to dress up.

399
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,620
 And Tim Farron, who's the head of the Liberal Democrats, who's the third biggest party in

400
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,620
 England.

401
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,180
 No, so who's the head of like the four of a fifth biggest party.

402
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,180
 He was going up.

403
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,620
 Which actually you might need to explain to people in Britain as well, given the state of

404
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,220
 Tim Farron's campaign.

405
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,420
 He ran against a guy called Mr. Fishfinger, who dressed like a fishfinger.

406
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,300
 And he, there was a man called Mr. Fishfinger running because, wasn't there a...

407
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
 There was a Twitter poll.

408
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:33,140
 So there was a Twitter user called Skip Licker, who just asked the question.

409
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,140
 Just a normal guy.

410
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,500
 First name, Skip, second name, Licker.

411
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,220
 And he asked, we were all completely losing the two of them.

412
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,700
 Do you think that's his real name?

413
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,700
 Of course, this is his real name.

414
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,980
 Why would it be his Twitter name if it wasn't his real name?

415
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,140
 It would be a weird thing to make up, wouldn't it?

416
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:55,820
 Anyway, he asked the question to Twitter, who would you trust more MP Tim Farron or a fishfinger?

417
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,140
 And the fishfinger's got 95% of the vote.

418
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,180
 And so this guy ran on...

419
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,620
 Tim Farron almost lost his deposit in the...

420
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,780
 Am I supposed to tell you that the fishfinger competition?

421
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,540
 But Mr. Fishfinger is amazing, so if you go on his website, I wanted to count the puns

422
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,020
 on it for this, but it was going to take me too much time.

423
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,460
 But he ran on the pledge to Hakebritten Great again.

424
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:23,100
 He had a manifesto in which there was a polo key document.

425
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,900
 He talks about his own cod-stituency.

426
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:31,060
 He has a list of endorsements, which is quite labour, but I guess fish have a dorsal fin.

427
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,580
 That's a big deal for him.

428
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,460
 I was just wondering, we've explained all about the election, but do we need to explain

429
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,820
 for Farron listeners what a fishfinger is?

430
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:46,180
 So a fishfinger is a piece of fish with breadcrumbs on it and deep fried.

431
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,180
 It is delicious.

432
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,700
 It's better than Tim Farron.

433
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,900
 So the point is that he was standing behind Tim Farron as Tim Farron made his speech as

434
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,900
 acceptance speech.

435
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,380
 But Theresa May had also had to stand next to...

436
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,380
 Buckethead.

437
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,260
 Well Buckethead and someone dressed as Elmo.

438
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,260
 Yes.

439
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,260
 A massive Elmo.

440
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,620
 I think he only got three votes, although I'm going to do it.

441
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,620
 Absolutely.

442
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,300
 Buckethead wiped the floor with him then.

443
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,420
 Buckethead absolutely destroyed Elmo at the selection.

444
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,260
 Well with the bucket for a head, he can do a lot of wiping eyes.

445
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,780
 That's just a lot to the floor with him.

446
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,460
 So I think we did a fact before on this podcast about people who got no votes in a general

447
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,060
 election, but it was before the rules were changed and then you were allowed to vote for

448
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,060
 yourself.

449
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:36,620
 But I think someone has got just one vote, a guy called Rainbow George Vice who stood

450
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,820
 in 13 different constituencies at one election before they changed the rules and said he can

451
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,860
 really at least stand in one election, one constituency.

452
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,060
 And he stands for the vote for yourself, Rainbow Dream Ticket Party and he won in 2005 in

453
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,060
 Cardiff North.

454
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:55,060
 He got one vote and it wasn't from him either because he wasn't registered in that constituency.

455
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,060
 Like Paul Nuttle.

456
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,900
 Paul Nuttle didn't vote for himself because he's not registered in the constituency where

457
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,900
 he was standing.

458
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
 Really?

459
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,460
 Paul Nuttle, you mean X, UKIP leader, because as we came in here, he resigned, didn't he?

460
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,460
 That's true.

461
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,140
 He caretaker between Farage leader of the...

462
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,140
 Yeah.

463
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,900
 Did you know, I think Winston Churchill couldn't vote for himself in the 1945 election?

464
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,900
 Really?

465
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,900
 Yeah, so there was...

466
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,900
 He lost, though.

467
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,900
 Didn't he?

468
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,900
 He sure did.

469
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,900
 Was it by one, though?

470
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
 It was not by one, though.

471
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:29,220
 It was a bureaucratic cook-up, so there was a lot of disorganisation because it was the

472
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,220
 end of the war.

473
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,780
 People had bigger fish to fry and they didn't have enough ballot papers.

474
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,340
 Bigger fish fingers to fry.

475
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,820
 So you had to use your ration card as your ballot paper to prove who you were and he

476
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,660
 just wasn't registered and so he worked up and didn't have a legal vote.

477
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,540
 That's pretty bad after you've defeated fascism, so there's not bit, but it's process, isn't

478
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
 it?

479
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,540
 It's all that process.

480
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,540
 You've got to respect it.

481
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,780
 And do you know that the joint leader of the Green Party, so the Green Party has two

482
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,300
 dual leadership and one of the leaders is Guy called Jonathan Bartley and he's also a

483
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,620
 drummer for a blues band called The Mustangs who've reached number five in the iTunes

484
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,620
 Blues Chart.

485
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,620
 Wow.

486
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,460
 He's in 2010 for Best Band of the British Blues Awards and I've listened to them and they're

487
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,780
 genuinely really good.

488
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,780
 Really?

489
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,780
 Yeah.

490
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,780
 Really fun to listen to.

491
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,780
 So, well done, Jonathan.

492
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:23,620
 Just speaking of Green, but in the drug sense, Green, Mr. Biro, Lord Biro as well.

493
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,860
 He wanted to nationalise marijuana cannabis and he wanted to call it British grass.

494
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,860
 Very good.

495
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,860
 Yeah.

496
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:37,860
 And just on process, Anna, if you are high on drugs or indeed drunk, they can't stop you

497
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,860
 from voting.

498
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,860
 Oh, yeah.

499
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,380
 Even if you're the Queen.

500
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,980
 And also if you're wearing a bucket on your head or something like that, they can't stop

501
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,980
 you from voting.

502
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
 You don't have to show your face.

503
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,980
 You're kidding.

504
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,980
 No.

505
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
 Oh, wow.

506
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,980
 Well, otherwise you wouldn't be on to vote in a bucket.

507
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,980
 Yeah.

508
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,980
 I guess not.

509
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,820
 And we'd find out who Lord Buckethead is when he goes to vote.

510
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,980
 There was a party that lost all of their deposits.

511
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,980
 Okay.

512
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:05,140
 And they lost, between 1992 and 2001, they contested 500 seats in that time, they lost every

513
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,140
 single deposit.

514
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,140
 You probably remember them.

515
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,140
 The natural law party.

516
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,140
 Oh, yeah.

517
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,140
 I remember that.

518
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,140
 Well, they're the levitating ones.

519
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,140
 They, yes.

520
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,140
 They worked.

521
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,980
 They were ones who thought they could never take.

522
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,980
 They believed.

523
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,020
 So a lot of listeners might remember them, a lot of listeners might not.

524
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,020
 They believed you could do this thing called yogic flying, which is basically bouncing

525
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,340
 around with your legs crossed on your bottom with big hot water bottles underneath you.

526
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,340
 Oh, wow.

527
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:35,820
 But they believed that the first policy, right, if they had won in 1997 was that they would

528
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,980
 make a special air service from the armed forces of 7,000 yogic flyers to hover in and fix

529
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,300
 everything in the country.

530
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
 Wow.

531
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,300
 I remember.

532
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,500
 I'm sure you told me, Sandy, that the trick to yogic flying has three steps.

533
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
 Oh, this is mine that I remember.

534
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,500
 What was it?

535
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
 One of the series.

536
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
 You can say it then.

537
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
 What was it?

538
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
 Because I can't remember.

539
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
 Oh, it was just the yogic flying.

540
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
 The way you get there is a three stage process.

541
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,740
 So I think stage one is standing on one foot and stage two is being able to hop on one foot

542
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,900
 and stage three is full levitation.

543
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,580
 And I remember a proud statement by the yogic flying institute saying we have successfully

544
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,540
 completed two of the three crucial steps.

545
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:24,820
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James.

546
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:30,500
 Okay, my fact this week is that Kenya have an election later this year and they're running

547
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:36,260
 out of symbols for their candidates, which means that candidates are now using symbols

548
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:42,220
 such as a milk packet, a termite and a robot.

549
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,220
 Okay.

550
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,260
 Look at Samford's round with the robots as their main thing, this time round, didn't they?

551
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,260
 Yeah.

552
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,260
 Oh, yeah.

553
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,260
 That was a good piece of satire.

554
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,260
 No, that was the joke about Theresa.

555
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,260
 Oh, it doesn't mess up.

556
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,260
 Guys, you two are tired, aren't you?

557
00:23:54,260 --> 00:24:00,700
 That was a very strong joke and stable.

558
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,700
 So yeah, this actually happens in quite a lot of places in the world and it's how important

559
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,220
 it is to have a symbol next to your name.

560
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,500
 So we know in Britain we have symbols for the Conservatives and Labour like the Rose and

561
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,740
 the torch and in America they would have the elephants and the donkey and whatever they

562
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,260
 have over there.

563
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,620
 But in lots of places in the world you have a lot of low literacy and so if you can't read

564
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,780
 the name of your preferred candidate you need to have the symbol and so they need a symbol

565
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,100
 which is really memorable and striking.

566
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,260
 They thought a termite would be there.

567
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,820
 People want to vote for that.

568
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,820
 I might.

569
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
 I would.

570
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,820
 What do you think about that?

571
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,660
 It's very industrious and they're hardworking and they get the job done and they think that's

572
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,660
 the idea.

573
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,100
 They club together and they achieve things.

574
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
 Yeah.

575
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,860
 Was the milk carton half full or half empty or was it a full of milk?

576
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,580
 That's how you look at it and that's what kind of person you want.

577
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,380
 No it was just you couldn't look inside the milk carton because it was just a depiction

578
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,700
 of one and actually this happens like I said quite a lot around the world in India.

579
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:08,860
 The election commission a lot symbols to you and so there's a big long list of 164 available

580
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:13,420
 symbols and you provide them three of them that you would like and then they choose one

581
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,020
 of the three if it's available.

582
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,020
 Yeah.

583
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,020
 So cool.

584
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,220
 They're all ones don't they like they have I was really not what was saying I think they've

585
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,860
 modernised their symbols lately because they've recently added a sewing machine so I don't

586
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,740
 know how modern they've got but they have scissors as one of the symbols you can choose a

587
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,740
 stethoscope.

588
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,380
 Do they have rock and paper?

589
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,900
 It's a three way marginal.

590
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,700
 An ice cream going for the youth vote.

591
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
 Yeah.

592
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,700
 Yeah.

593
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,700
 They have.

594
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
 They do it in Egypt as well.

595
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,700
 I saw the actual symbols.

596
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:51,580
 The picture here they use everything from a tractor to a ballistic missile to a tap

597
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:57,500
 to this is my favourite one a mobile phone but the mobile phone symbol has a picture in

598
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,620
 the mobile phone like a background and I'm pretty sure it's the politician who was running

599
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:06,660
 but you know the thing with Egypt is it's not just that you choose three and they choose

600
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,740
 for you it's actually completely random that they choose the symbol for you.

601
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,620
 So you say I'm going to run in Egypt and they just randomly pick you a symbol.

602
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,700
 So you'll have some politicians who think they're really kind of serious and you'll see

603
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,580
 their poster and then it's got all of their picture and all of their stuff on there and

604
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,860
 then there's like a picture of a banana next to it.

605
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,380
 It's just ridiculous.

606
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,820
 And like for instance it can be quite bad because there was a female MP who had a rocket

607
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:41,860
 as her symbol just allocated randomly but rocket means hotty in Egyptian slang apparently.

608
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,540
 So she was like well I can't do this I'm a serious MP you can't call me a hotty but

609
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,540
 that wasn't random.

610
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:52,260
 I bet it was an all-male panel that randomly selected those symbols at some point.

611
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,820
 It's one of the symbols of penis.

612
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,460
 No, I think bananas as close as you get.

613
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,700
 One of the ones I'm looking at here is a cannon camera.

614
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,500
 Like it's actually got the cannon logo on it.

615
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
 That's cool.

616
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,740
 Well I look through the canyon list and they're really random so there's an electrical

617
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,980
 socket, there's some broken handcuffs, there's a steering wheel.

618
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,740
 Broken handcuffs does not say to me tough on crime.

619
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,260
 That says major cuts in crime.

620
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,020
 So the canyon election is between Ahoru and NASA.

621
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,020
 NASA?

622
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,020
 What the American Space Agency?

623
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,580
 No, the National Super Alliance party.

624
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,580
 So it's President Ahoru Kenyatta and everyone else is kind of gang together with a coalition

625
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,860
 to go against him and they called themselves a National Super Alliance party known as

626
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,980
 the abbreviation NASA and they're hoping that their coalition will unseat him.

627
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,700
 I think the election is in August.

628
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,980
 I'm glad I don't have any places unstable as Kenya where there's one party which has got

629
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,620
 just about half the seats and one which is definitely trying to club together.

630
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,300
 This is going to go out of date so quickly, I don't know if I'm going to say it.

631
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,140
 We're going to date before tonight, will it?

632
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,140
 Might do actually.

633
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,140
 You know, no.

634
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,140
 Yeah.

635
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,140
 So just you mentioned brands in logos.

636
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,140
 Yeah.

637
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:12,380
 There are some places where companies get a vote so I was looking at how Hong Kong elections

638
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,380
 work actually.

639
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,380
 You might know this.

640
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:21,200
 So the way Hong Kong constituencies are divided up is that five of their seats are geographical

641
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,820
 seats and then all the rest are and then all the rest are like for companies and so they

642
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:33,340
 get like an industry seat and they get an agricultural seat and they get a tourism seat

643
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,300
 and it's really weird because that means that people like Canada air get a vote in the Hong

644
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,300
 Kong elections.

645
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
 Wow.

646
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,300
 That is insane.

647
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,300
 Yeah, they do.

648
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,900
 So all these airlines from all around the world get votes in the Hong Kong elections.

649
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,140
 Does a company vote equal the same as a single person's vote?

650
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,140
 I think it does.

651
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,140
 Yeah.

652
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,140
 Or it might be more in fact.

653
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,140
 Wow.

654
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,140
 Yeah.

655
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,140
 It's really weird.

656
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,140
 That's amazing.

657
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,180
 I'm going to just sit as MPs.

658
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,420
 Because corporations by law are individuals, aren't they?

659
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,420
 Right.

660
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,020
 I mean, that's just a technical legal thing, but I think they are.

661
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,020
 Yeah.

662
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,020
 They'll be able to vote in this country.

663
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,780
 But they're not standing up for themselves.

664
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,020
 They used to have, I think we've said this before, that universities used to get a vote.

665
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
 Did they?

666
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,820
 So as well as the city of Oxford having an MP or maybe it was two MPs, actually at the time

667
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,060
 it was each constituency had two MPs, Oxford and Cambridge each got to send an MP or two

668
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,060
 to the House of Commons.

669
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,060
 It is.

670
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,060
 And that meant that students used to get two votes.

671
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:28,900
 So it was until 1950, I think, 1948 and so it was Oxford got MP, Cambridge on MP, all

672
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,940
 the London ones got an MP and then just all the other Unies got an MP.

673
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,860
 And then yeah, it sounds like university challenges.

674
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,380
 It morphed into that.

675
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,100
 Wow, that's amazing.

676
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,740
 And then students didn't vote again until last night.

677
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,700
 So did you hear the thing recently about Donald Trump's logo, speaking of logos?

678
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,340
 No, it's his logo.

679
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:55,220
 It's a crest and it has the word Trump on it, but it turns out that he just nicked it from

680
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,540
 somebody else and it was an old English crest and he took off the word integrity and put

681
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,660
 him on the word Trump, which is the most amazing metaphor.

682
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,900
 So funny.

683
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:14,460
 Yeah, it was the husband of the woman who built Mar-a-Lago, got given this crest in 1939.

684
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,300
 Mar-a-Lago, his, you know, his second wife, his golf club.

685
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,980
 And the Trump organisation just took that coat of arms, changed the word, never asked permission

686
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,980
 from anyone.

687
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:27,660
 And then when he came back to the UK to open his horrible golf course, he, um, I'm sure it's

688
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,980
 a very nice golf course if anyone wants to give me free land of golf.

689
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:37,620
 Sorry, when the, when his fantastic golf course opened, um, he got in trouble because he hadn't

690
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:42,700
 registered the emblem according to the 1672 Lion King of Arms Act in Scotland.

691
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,260
 And then he tried to trademark and they said, no, that's already a thing here.

692
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,260
 You can't do that.

693
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,260
 Wow.

694
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,260
 So he had to invent a new crest solely to use in his Scottish golf courses, but in America

695
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,060
 he's still using the one he's nicked.

696
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,860
 I think a lot of it is Americans listening to this would probably be quite amused by

697
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,860
 how uptight we are about our crests, I should think.

698
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,860
 Yes.

699
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,620
 Well, the New York Times wrote in its cover, as they said, the British are known for taking

700
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,900
 Haraldry very seriously.

701
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:17,420
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

702
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,900
 My fact is that in the 19th century, one of England's constituencies had no people living

703
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:27,780
 in it and another one was underwater.

704
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,780
 Wow.

705
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,180
 These are so, they're called rotten burrows, which are constituencies where there used to

706
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,560
 be a load of people living there and it made sense for them to have two MPs and then over

707
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,540
 time the population changes or the place goes derelict, but the rules haven't been updated

708
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,180
 so they still get MPs.

709
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,900
 And then it's really easy for someone, normally the landowner who owns the land, to just

710
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,020
 take over the place, pick his own MPs and send them to the elsewhere.

711
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
 That's amazing.

712
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,060
 Yeah, there's a black-adder episode, which is all about this, basically.

713
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,060
 Really?

714
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:00,180
 And one of the constituencies that was underwater, Dunnich, is the inspiration for the thing

715
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,460
 in the episode, which is called Dunnie on the World.

716
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,460
 Oh, really?

717
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,460
 Yes.

718
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,660
 Do you know that Dunnich was the capital of the Kingdom of the East Angles?

719
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,660
 What is it?

720
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:13,940
 Yeah, well, so it used to be a really important place and it was a port similar in size to

721
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:18,700
 the 14th century London, according to Wikipedia, so it was a massive, massive place and that's

722
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,700
 why they had this boat.

723
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,700
 Yeah.

724
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:26,580
 It's supposedly, yeah, exactly, rivaled the capital, and it's called Daniel like this, the

725
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,060
 British Atlantis.

726
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,060
 Oh, yeah.

727
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,060
 What do you mean?

728
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,060
 It is called that.

729
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,820
 I'm calling it that now.

730
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,820
 Who calls it that?

731
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,820
 This guy.

732
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,820
 But Atlantis isn't the thing about Atlantis that we don't know where it is.

733
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,820
 We know where Dunnich is.

734
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,820
 It just doesn't.

735
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,820
 It's just not there anymore.

736
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,820
 It fell into the sea.

737
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:47,500
 I forgot it fell into the sea, I thought it was just a place we couldn't find.

738
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
 Yeah.

739
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,500
 No, it fell into the sea.

740
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
 Yeah, and it's the British Atlantis.

741
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,300
 It's not claiming to be the Atlantis.

742
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,300
 Yeah.

743
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300
 Anyway, guys.

744
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,300
 Yeah.

745
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,300
 I got that.

746
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,300
 But you got that.

747
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,300
 It's still there, okay, and it's underwater.

748
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:03,100
 And supposedly at midnight or at night, you can hear church bells dangling around in the

749
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,100
 water.

750
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,100
 And that's just someone voting with their penis.

751
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,500
 And it had eight churches, it had two hospitals, and there's one man.

752
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,820
 This was a piece in the India about ten years ago.

753
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,860
 He's called Stuart Bacon, and he's done about a thousand dives down there, and he has a map

754
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,860
 which was printed five hundred years ago, and he can make his way around by touch.

755
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,860
 Wow.

756
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,860
 The city underwater.

757
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,860
 That is extremely cool.

758
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,860
 It's so cool.

759
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,860
 Yeah, that's amazing.

760
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,860
 So what's left of it?

761
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,860
 Is there like building?

762
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,700
 There was almost nothing left.

763
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,100
 Most of it was swept away in the two stores.

764
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,500
 There's like a church, a few houses, a pret.

765
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,620
 Socky sandwiches.

766
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,060
 So it did that actually had about two hundred people living there, which is much larger than

767
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,540
 a load of other constituencies.

768
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,060
 And before they were reformed, there were fifty seats in the country which each had fewer

769
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,700
 than fifty voters living in them.

770
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,700
 So funny.

771
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,340
 And it was the 1832 reform act, a bit of process for you to remember.

772
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,020
 And it was that act which got rid of these burrows, but it was also the act that excluded

773
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:05,300
 women from voting, because until then it wasn't explicitly against the rules for women

774
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,300
 to vote.

775
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,300
 If they were landowners, they couldn't theory.

776
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,300
 One did actually.

777
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,860
 I think the first woman to vote was in the late 1500s because she was a widow of a big landowner

778
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,580
 who'd been the person who would nominate the person to go to Parliament, so she got

779
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,580
 to nominate.

780
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,740
 So, women got the vote in the 16th century.

781
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,540
 But did you know that Charles James Fox, who's a famous British Prime Minister, when he

782
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,060
 became leader, he was too young to vote.

783
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,020
 So he was 19 when he became leader in 1768 and the voting age was 21.

784
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,380
 How does that work then?

785
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:38,940
 I guess just other people voted for, and his father bought the constituency for him.

786
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,940
 There we go.

787
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,260
 It was shit and epitaph.

788
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,260
 Wow.

789
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,860
 So Aaron from the Green Party doing his A level history exam, back then might not have been

790
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,860
 able to vote either.

791
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,860
 Yeah.

792
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,860
 What do you think?

793
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,860
 18 would have been too young.

794
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,860
 Yeah.

795
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,860
 Wow.

796
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,340
 So, one of the features of rotten burrows, which were a massive problem, obviously, in the

797
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,780
 country, was this thing called pot walloping.

798
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,940
 I had never heard of this.

799
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,940
 It's so cool.

800
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,340
 So, before the reform act, then you could vote in certain areas if you were a pot wallapper.

801
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,340
 And what it meant was, is that you had a pot or a cauldron.

802
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:19,060
 And if you had a pot that was big enough, if you had a pot, a proper big cooking pot, it

803
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,380
 showed that you had a hearth that was big enough to put the pot in.

804
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,300
 And if you had a hearth that was big enough to put the pot in, then you obviously had

805
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,500
 the freehold of a house and therefore you were considered responsible enough to vote.

806
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,980
 So, could you not just get a knockoff pot off either?

807
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,980
 Yeah.

808
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,980
 You would have thought so.

809
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,980
 Yeah.

810
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,980
 Did you have to bring a pot with you to the voting boat?

811
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,860
 That's why nobody voted, because people were dragging these enormous heavy cauldrons around

812
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,860
 the streets.

813
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,180
 They actually had one guy called Lord Culdron Head.

814
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:51,500
 Isn't it the case that they had to, if you were voting, it was done in public, one by

815
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,500
 one.

816
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,500
 Yes.

817
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
 It's done in public.

818
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
 And it took ages.

819
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
 Right.

820
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,420
 But did you have to declare it sort of to everyone or was it a secret ballot?

821
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,420
 No, no, you did.

822
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,580
 The ballot wasn't introduced until the 1870.

823
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,580
 Wow.

824
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,540
 That meant that you could obviously, people could sort of bribe you.

825
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,540
 Yeah.

826
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,780
 It was called treating your constituents, you get them free food and drink basically.

827
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,780
 Yeah.

828
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,300
 And sometimes that would cost so much money that only one person could afford to stand

829
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,780
 in the seat anyway.

830
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,780
 Hmm.

831
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,540
 People used to sign their ballot papers, actually, because that was a good, because the

832
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,980
 person who had been elected would go through the ballot papers afterwards and look at

833
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,100
 who voted for them and be like, "Oh, Johnny, I'll give him a little present."

834
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,260
 Mr. penis is voted for him.

835
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:34,420
 And if you were super rich, presumably you could gift people pots to allow them to vote for

836
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,420
 you.

837
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,420
 To give them the franchise.

838
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,420
 Yeah.

839
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,420
 To gain votes.

840
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,420
 Yeah.

841
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,420
 Okay, get this.

842
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,420
 The 1784 election.

843
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:46,420
 Voting opened in the Westminster constituency on the 1st of April and it closed on the 17th

844
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,420
 of May.

845
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,420
 What?

846
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,420
 What?

847
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,780
 Took nearly two months just to gather the votes, because they didn't have this thing, because

848
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,260
 obviously they didn't have mass communication and they didn't need to do the election all

849
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,700
 on the same day, basically.

850
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:01,660
 But Sondland still turned in all their votes by 10 p.m. that day.

851
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,060
 Sondland's like the swatty kid in the class, isn't it?

852
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,060
 Hey, not this year, though.

853
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,060
 I know, they got this.

854
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,060
 They got this.

855
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,100
 Oh, so quickly explain that for overseas people, Sondland usually.

856
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:15,620
 So the polls close at 10 o'clock, and Sondland for the last 20 years has always been the first

857
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,780
 constituency to give their result, and they usually do it by about 11 or something like

858
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,780
 that.

859
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,780
 They're really, really quick.

860
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,780
 They're really, really quick.

861
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,780
 But this was the first year in ages.

862
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,620
 In my lifetime, I think that Newcastle has beaten them.

863
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,620
 Yeah.

864
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,420
 And as a Newcastle fan, I was thrilled with the result of that derby between them.

865
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,540
 It's been a bad year for Sondland all together, isn't it, because they got relegated from the

866
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,100
 Premier League and now this.

867
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,300
 And Newcastle got promoted from the championships.

868
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,100
 So in your face, Sondland.

869
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
 Wow.

870
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,180
 We're not doing a tall day in Sondland, are we?

871
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,180
 Not anymore.

872
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,180
 Should we wrap up?

873
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,180
 Sure.

874
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,180
 Yeah, let's go to bed.

875
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,180
 Yeah.

876
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,180
 Oh, wait.

877
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,180
 Can I tell you?

878
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,180
 Oh, no.

879
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,620
 I'm just a bit more processed to finish off.

880
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,460
 This is, I was just really surprised about this.

881
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:06,700
 Supermarkets, people who shop in certain supermarkets vote for certain people.

882
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,620
 And where would you guess, Aldi and Little, how their loyalty is these days?

883
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,060
 They're budget shops, so I would imagine it's people on a tighter budget, so I'd say Labour.

884
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,060
 Yeah.

885
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,060
 What a thought, so wouldn't you?

886
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,060
 It's the Tories.

887
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,060
 There's Tories voters.

888
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,060
 So actually, the Tories have all supermarkets shoppers.

889
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,260
 I don't know where Labour voters are shopping.

890
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:28,220
 Tories shop in Tesco's, Waitrose, St. Breeze, Aldi and Little are now all conservative.

891
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,540
 And it's just Morrison's and Astor that they've got the Labour vote.

892
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:35,380
 But you do hear about Little Britain, don't you?

893
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,300
 Ah, true Labour voters grow all their own produce on their allotments.

894
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:46,620
 Okay, that's it.

895
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,220
 That's all we can do.

896
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,820
 We need to go to sleep now.

897
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,820
 We are knackered.

898
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,140
 I need to close my working eye.

899
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,900
 And we will be back again next week with another episode.

900
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,380
 Until then, you can reach us and chat more to us about the British elections if you want

901
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,380
 on our Twitter accounts.

902
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:10,340
 I'm on @Streiberland, James, @SkipLicca, @EggShate, Andy, Andrew Hunter M, and Shazinski.

908
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:26,180
 There's also our tour dates for the UK, and there's also a link to our book which is coming

909
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,220
 out in November.

910
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,420
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

911
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,420
 We'll see you then.

912
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:31,940
 Goodbye.
