00:00:17,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:20,00:00:24,coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden also coming to you from the morning
00:00:24,00:00:27,after the 2017 British General Election.
00:00:27,00:00:28,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:28,00:00:33,"I'm sitting here with Ani Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:00:33,00:00:35,"Andrew Hunter Murray, so I'm tired."
00:00:35,00:00:37,Andrew Hunter.
00:00:37,00:00:38,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:38,00:00:42,"I'm sitting here with Ani Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:00:42,00:00:46,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:00:46,00:00:51,"from the last night, the evening of the election."
00:00:51,00:00:53,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:53,00:00:55,"Hey Dan, you sound a bit tired."
00:00:55,00:00:57,I'm very tired.
00:00:57,00:01:00,But which one of us stayed up the latest and the longest?
00:01:00,00:01:02,"Well, the problem was, I didn't watch it on TV."
00:01:02,00:01:05,I think all of us stayed watching it on TV.
00:01:05,00:01:09,"We made the mistake of watching it on plus one, so you got even less sleep than the rest of us."
00:01:09,00:01:12,We watched it on my iPhone in bed with the lights off.
00:01:12,00:01:17,"My left eye, which did all the watching, because my right eye was in a pillow, is really"
00:01:17,00:01:18,twitching right now.
00:01:18,00:01:23,"But because it's on the left, it'll be very happy with the results."
00:01:23,00:01:26,"Okay, starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:01:26,00:01:32,"Yeah, my fact is the really relevant to this result fact, all forfeited election deposits"
00:01:32,00:01:35,go straight to the queen.
00:01:35,00:01:36,And this is just the thing I found out.
00:01:36,00:01:42,"I was reading the Electoral Commission Guide for Returning Officers, as you do in an exciting"
00:01:42,00:01:43,time like this.
00:01:43,00:01:45,You've got to do exciting things.
00:01:45,00:01:47,"And yeah, there was just a rule in it."
00:01:47,00:01:48,It's like for returning officers.
00:01:48,00:01:52,"So for anyone, internationally listening returning officers are the people who are responsible"
00:01:52,00:01:56,"in every constituency for like, organising and announcing the election."
00:01:56,00:02:00,"And this is the long guide, as to exactly how they go about doing that."
00:02:00,00:02:05,"What it says in the guide is, if a candidate does not poll more than 5% of the total number"
00:02:05,00:02:10,"of valid votes cast, that deposit will be forfeited, you must send any forfeited deposits"
00:02:10,00:02:11,to her majesty.
00:02:11,00:02:16,"So the deposits are £500, that people put up if they want to be an MP, again for international"
00:02:16,00:02:17,listeners.
00:02:17,00:02:21,"And then if you get under 5%, you fall for the deposit, but I didn't realise it went"
00:02:21,00:02:22,to her majesty.
00:02:22,00:02:24,I can't find anything else about this online.
00:02:24,00:02:25,It's amazing though.
00:02:25,00:02:30,"In 2010, you kept alone lost £229,000 in deposits."
00:02:30,00:02:31,No way.
00:02:31,00:02:32,Wow.
00:02:32,00:02:33,"And the green party lost £163,500."
00:02:33,00:02:34,Of course it is.
00:02:34,00:02:35,No wonder the Queen's so rich.
00:02:35,00:02:36,"Yeah, no."
00:02:36,00:02:40,"In 2010, there was about a million pounds in lost deposits."
00:02:40,00:02:41,That is a lot.
00:02:41,00:02:42,It is a lot.
00:02:42,00:02:43,Wow.
00:02:43,00:02:45,"The idea of this deposit is to stop frivolous campaigns, isn't it?"
00:02:45,00:02:47,"Yeah, but it does a very good job."
00:02:47,00:02:49,I think the Monterey from Looney Party would agree.
00:02:49,00:02:55,"In 1983, they had a look at this, the Home Affairs Committee to see if it was, you know,"
00:02:55,00:02:58,if it was too much and if it was stopping poorer people from running.
00:02:58,00:03:02,"And they kind of thought, well, maybe it is, but actually it's worth it because for your"
00:03:02,00:03:07,"500 quid, even if you lose, you get free postage for your campaign address and you get free"
00:03:07,00:03:12,"use of buildings for public meetings and you get a great deal of publicity, they said."
00:03:12,00:03:14,So almost the 500 quid is worth it.
00:03:14,00:03:17,"And they actually recommended it should be up to £1,000."
00:03:17,00:03:18,"Oh, really?"
00:03:18,00:03:19,But it never was.
00:03:19,00:03:23,"Well, I might just enter a not even campaign just for the sake of getting some publicity"
00:03:23,00:03:24,for myself and some free buildings.
00:03:24,00:03:26,"We're going to enter you, weren't we?"
00:03:26,00:03:30,"Because you live in the same constituency as Jeremy Corbyn, but he did quite well in the"
00:03:30,00:03:31,swan didn't he?
00:03:31,00:03:32,So you could have swung it out.
00:03:32,00:03:33,I could have.
00:03:33,00:03:38,Are they saying that he did the best that any politician has ever done?
00:03:38,00:03:39,He got the highest.
00:03:39,00:03:42,"He didn't, he didn't win at the election, but in his constituency."
00:03:42,00:03:46,"Yeah, he got the highest ever vote in isn't enough."
00:03:46,00:03:47,Wow.
00:03:47,00:03:48,Which is the smallest constituency.
00:03:48,00:03:49,I didn't know.
00:03:49,00:03:50,It's also mine.
00:03:50,00:03:51,So I had a personal interest in that.
00:03:51,00:03:52,Really?
00:03:52,00:03:53,Yeah.
00:03:53,00:03:54,It's a smallest package.
00:03:54,00:03:56,Do you know what the largest one is?
00:03:56,00:03:57,"No, what?"
00:03:57,00:04:03,"It's Ross, Sky and Lock Arbor in Scotland, which is 1,632 times larger than Islington North."
00:04:03,00:04:04,Really?
00:04:04,00:04:05,"Yeah, huh."
00:04:05,00:04:10,And so I worked that out and I worked out that if Jeremy Corbyn's allotment was increased
00:04:10,00:04:14,"by that amount, then it would be the size of the Vatican city."
00:04:14,00:04:15,Wow.
00:04:15,00:04:18,Maybe it will be now.
00:04:18,00:04:23,"Just on the Queen very quickly, so overseas listeners might not know this, but the Queen's"
00:04:23,00:04:26,not allowed to vote in these elections.
00:04:26,00:04:27,She is allowed to vote.
00:04:27,00:04:28,Of course she just doesn't.
00:04:28,00:04:31,"Sorry, she chooses not to, and every, every one of..."
00:04:31,00:04:32,She doesn't care.
00:04:32,00:04:33,But these are real problems in this country.
00:04:33,00:04:34,It goes right up to the top.
00:04:34,00:04:35,Right?
00:04:35,00:04:36,Because she's old.
00:04:36,00:04:37,"You know, you'd think she would care more."
00:04:37,00:04:40,"Of course, she doesn't want the votes to go higher, because she wants this delicious money"
00:04:40,00:04:41,from the last department.
00:04:41,00:04:42,Exactly.
00:04:42,00:04:43,But also...
00:04:43,00:04:47,"So sorry, you've just got 4.999% of the vote in the constituency."
00:04:47,00:04:50,"See the Queen going, yes."
00:04:50,00:04:58,"But she spends most of her time in these periods, and for the referendum and so on, just denying"
00:04:58,00:05:00,"that she has an opinion, which I love."
00:05:00,00:05:04,Every single royal member just seems to spend their whole period any time they're mentioned
00:05:04,00:05:07,"in the press in these periods, denying that what they've said is, in some way, alluding"
00:05:07,00:05:11,to an opinion about what way people should vote for it.
00:05:11,00:05:14,"But they can have opinions on things like catch up or mayonnaise, or, you know, do you"
00:05:14,00:05:16,prefer a buzzcut or long hair?
00:05:16,00:05:18,They're just not supposed to have political views.
00:05:18,00:05:19,"Yes, no, exactly."
00:05:19,00:05:20,But not any opinion.
00:05:20,00:05:21,I've obviously been...
00:05:21,00:05:23,Have you heard of Prince Charles?
00:05:23,00:05:25,Consistently raised to everyone who will...
00:05:25,00:05:27,"He has been leaked, aren't they?"
00:05:27,00:05:29,He hasn't openly done that.
00:05:29,00:05:30,He doesn't know that.
00:05:30,00:05:36,"That reminds me of the Emperor of Japan, Akihito, who's not allowed to give any opinions"
00:05:36,00:05:41,"on politics at all, not even just in elections, just never ever, and it's in the constitution"
00:05:41,00:05:43,that comes from the end of the Second World War.
00:05:43,00:05:44,And so he wasn't allowed to abdicate.
00:05:44,00:05:48,"He wasn't allowed to say, ""I want to abdicate,"" he had to kind of do an announcement alluding"
00:05:48,00:05:53,"to the fact that he might want to, and then people had to kind of infer from what he said"
00:05:53,00:05:54,that he wanted to abdicate.
00:05:54,00:05:55,"So, wink, wink."
00:05:55,00:05:56,"That stuff, wow."
00:05:56,00:05:57,Pretty tight.
00:05:57,00:05:58,You didn't...
00:05:58,00:06:02,"You may have not seen that in the news last night, but they passed that he is now allowed"
00:06:02,00:06:03,to abdicate.
00:06:03,00:06:04,"Oh, really?"
00:06:04,00:06:05,"Yeah, yeah."
00:06:05,00:06:06,"I was in the news last night, hope."
00:06:06,00:06:07,"Oh, I didn't see that."
00:06:07,00:06:08,Yeah.
00:06:08,00:06:13,"But on, like, process, weird election, an electoral process, if it's a tie, it comes down to a coin"
00:06:13,00:06:18,"to us, which obviously never happens, but there was that guy in Anne's constituency, so one"
00:06:18,00:06:24,"of our colleagues Anne used to live up North, and it's in North East 5, and I think the person"
00:06:24,00:06:27,"who won was an S.M.P candidate who won by two votes this morning, right?"
00:06:27,00:06:28,Yeah.
00:06:28,00:06:29,Wow.
00:06:29,00:06:30,Two votes.
00:06:30,00:06:31,Wow.
00:06:31,00:06:32,"Oh, my God."
00:06:32,00:06:33,"So that's just one person, isn't it?"
00:06:33,00:06:34,Yeah.
00:06:34,00:06:35,Putting the X in the wrong body.
00:06:35,00:06:36,Exactly.
00:06:36,00:06:37,Did you guys see the Green Party candidate from...
00:06:37,00:06:38,Ashfield?
00:06:38,00:06:39,No.
00:06:39,00:06:42,"Okay, so his name's Aaron Rangy."
00:06:42,00:06:48,He had to leave the count as it was going on because he had to get home to get some sleep
00:06:48,00:06:53,"because he has an A-level history exam at nine o'clock this morning, so he's 18 years"
00:06:53,00:06:54,old.
00:06:54,00:06:58,"He's the Green Party candidate, and it just got too late for him, so I can't stay for the"
00:06:58,00:06:59,final count.
00:06:59,00:07:00,Got my exam.
00:07:00,00:07:03,They should let you off having a history exam if you're making history.
00:07:03,00:07:04,Yes.
00:07:04,00:07:07,I'll see definitely did in the Green Party.
00:07:07,00:07:08,Yeah.
00:07:08,00:07:10,"Yeah, I'd take it he won the seat presumably, right?"
00:07:10,00:07:11,I have no idea.
00:07:11,00:07:13,"No, I mean, he didn't win the seat."
00:07:13,00:07:14,Okay.
00:07:14,00:07:18,"You know the deposit thing that we were starting off with, did you know it used to be a lot"
00:07:18,00:07:19,harder?
00:07:19,00:07:27,"So, until I think 1918, or definitely in 1918, it was £150 that you had to put up, but"
00:07:27,00:07:28,obviously that was a lot more money then.
00:07:28,00:07:29,Yeah.
00:07:29,00:07:30,It was about...
00:07:30,00:07:31,Yeah.
00:07:31,00:07:38,"And you had to win 12.5% of the vote, otherwise you would forfeit your deposit, so it was a much"
00:07:38,00:07:39,higher barrier.
00:07:39,00:07:45,"Another place you need to get 12.5% is in Japan, and do you know how much the Japanese deposit"
00:07:45,00:07:46,is that you have to pay?
00:07:46,00:07:47,No.
00:07:47,00:07:55,"It's 3 million yen, which is the equivalent of £21,064, and you need 12.5%."
00:07:55,00:07:58,But then they don't get all those hilarious fringe candidates that can entertain them during
00:07:58,00:08:00,"a tedious campaign, right?"
00:08:00,00:08:03,"I suppose not, unless they're extremely rich."
00:08:03,00:08:04,Very wealthy ones.
00:08:04,00:08:05,Yeah.
00:08:05,00:08:08,"Just another thing on, on process."
00:08:08,00:08:09,If you...
00:08:09,00:08:13,"I really think, I think process was a big winner in this election, don't you?"
00:08:13,00:08:18,"It was certainly what I voted for, I just wrote it in my box."
00:08:18,00:08:21,"I love that I'm doing this, the way I'm doing it."
00:08:21,00:08:25,"So I didn't realise that actually, as long as you make your intention clear on the ballot"
00:08:25,00:08:29,"paper, then your vote counts, so I thought you had to do a cross or maybe a tick."
00:08:29,00:08:35,"But if you draw a penis, as long as it's within the lines of the candidate in whose box"
00:08:35,00:08:38,"you've drawn a penis, it does count as a vote."
00:08:38,00:08:43,"And so there was, for instance, there was a Tory MP, Glenn Davis in 2015, who held onto"
00:08:43,00:08:48,"the Montgomeryshire constituency in Wales, and he personally thanked the person who voted"
00:08:48,00:08:50,for him by drawing a penis in his box.
00:08:50,00:08:54,"But it sort of depends how you feel about penises, doesn't it?"
00:08:54,00:08:55,You're right.
00:08:55,00:08:56,So do you think...
00:08:56,00:08:59,"When people call you a dick, Andy, do you look at them and think, ""Yeah, but he probably"
00:08:59,00:09:00,"likes dick."""
00:09:00,00:09:12,"Actually, on that spoiling vote thing, in the last British election 2015, there were 97,870"
00:09:12,00:09:13,"spoiled votes, right?"
00:09:13,00:09:19,"The last time the Gambia had an election, there were two really spoiled ballots in the whole"
00:09:19,00:09:20,country.
00:09:20,00:09:21,What?
00:09:21,00:09:24,Because the Gambian voting system is really cool.
00:09:24,00:09:28,"If you've got three candidates, you have three buckets next to each other, you've got"
00:09:28,00:09:32,"three barrels next to each other, and they've got a little shoot at the top, and you push..."
00:09:32,00:09:36,"You get given a marble, and you push the marble through the little shoot at the top, and"
00:09:36,00:09:38,"it dings a bell, so everyone can hear it."
00:09:38,00:09:39,So how do you spoil your vote?
00:09:39,00:09:41,"Now, do you put your penis in there?"
00:09:41,00:09:43,To spoil your vote.
00:09:43,00:09:49,"You have to balance a marble on top of the barrel, and only two people did it in the whole"
00:09:49,00:09:50,country.
00:09:50,00:09:51,"No, that's a fraction."
00:09:51,00:09:52,"Yeah, what?"
00:09:52,00:09:53,You kidding?
00:09:53,00:09:54,That's incredible.
00:09:54,00:09:55,It's a great system.
00:09:55,00:09:56,They've had the system since the '60s.
00:09:56,00:09:57,It really works for them.
00:09:57,00:10:01,"If you spoil your ballot by putting your penis in the tube, then the electoral guy comes"
00:10:01,00:10:05,"along and goes, ""Do you like penises, though?"""
00:10:05,00:10:08,"The bell keeps going, ""Ling-ling-ling-ling-ling."""
00:10:08,00:10:14,"That's actually more akin to the word ballot, isn't it, because ballot comes from, I think,"
00:10:14,00:10:18,"a word that means little ball, because it used to be that you actually put a ball into"
00:10:18,00:10:19,a box.
00:10:19,00:10:20,That's right.
00:10:20,00:10:21,I think so.
00:10:21,00:10:22,We can start thinking about moving on.
00:10:22,00:10:23,"Yeah, shall we?"
00:10:23,00:10:24,What should we move on?
00:10:24,00:10:27,"That's a lot more stuff to say, one process, I know."
00:10:27,00:10:30,So much process.
00:10:30,00:10:32,I do like the first ballot box.
00:10:32,00:10:34,It's just got more presents.
00:10:34,00:10:38,"I know you said it in just, that's really hoping to move on."
00:10:38,00:10:40,"Look, this is a great fact, guys."
00:10:40,00:10:42,It's not all about this election.
00:10:42,00:10:47,"The first ever secret ballot when it was introduced in the UK was in 1872, and the seal"
00:10:47,00:10:51,"of the first ballot box was made with a licorice stamp, so there are famous licorices"
00:10:51,00:10:55,"in the UK that are called Pontifract Licorices, and they're like black sweets, and they have"
00:10:55,00:11:00,"a stamp on them, which says Pontifract Licorice has a picture of Pontifract Castle, and when"
00:11:00,00:11:03,"they had to close the first ballot box in 1872, they had to whip one over."
00:11:03,00:11:08,"It was in Pontifract, so they got one of those stamps over from Pontifract, and they stamped"
00:11:08,00:11:09,"it with a licorice stamp, so..."
00:11:09,00:11:10,That's really cool.
00:11:10,00:11:11,That's very cool.
00:11:11,00:11:12,...liquish logo on it.
00:11:12,00:11:14,That's a good process.
00:11:14,00:11:16,"Great process, guys."
00:11:16,00:11:25,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:11:25,00:11:32,My fact this week is that only one political party in this 2017 election offered to do anything
00:11:32,00:11:33,about yetis.
00:11:33,00:11:36,"Oh, did they get your votes?"
00:11:36,00:11:37,I didn't.
00:11:37,00:11:38,I've only found out about it too late.
00:11:38,00:11:39,Yeah.
00:11:39,00:11:40,What's the party?
00:11:40,00:11:44,"The party goes by a number of names, actually."
00:11:44,00:11:49,"It's sort of formally, as its main headline name known as ""Church of the militant Elvis Party."""
00:11:49,00:11:52,"It's also known as the ""Buspass Elvis Party."""
00:11:52,00:11:53,"Oh, yeah, those ones."
00:11:53,00:11:58,"This year they ran under the title ""Elvis"" and the Yeti Himalayan Preservation Party."
00:11:58,00:12:00,"So there is a common theme that runs through their names, isn't it?"
00:12:00,00:12:01,Yes.
00:12:01,00:12:02,Party.
00:12:02,00:12:03,Yes.
00:12:03,00:12:04,Yeah.
00:12:04,00:12:13,"Yeah, so the guy who was running is a guy called David Bishop, aka Lord Biro, and he was"
00:12:13,00:12:17,promising this year that if they were voted in that he would do stuff about the potential
00:12:17,00:12:23,"threats from North Korea and launching missiles, because if they miss-launched missile in"
00:12:23,00:12:26,"the wrong direction, it might hit Tibet and harm Yetis."
00:12:26,00:12:30,So that was his protection policy that he wants to get in on.
00:12:30,00:12:32,And he actually was stepping down.
00:12:32,00:12:36,He said he was going to step down completely and then did his own personal eutern on it
00:12:36,00:12:42,because Theresa May called a general election when he thought I'm not going to be in
00:12:42,00:12:45,a fit state in a few years to come.
00:12:45,00:12:49,"But then he said when he heard that Mick Jagger was going on tour again this autumn, he thought,"
00:12:49,00:12:50,"OK, I can run to."
00:12:50,00:12:57,And so actually this snap election has been bad news for these kind of slightly unusual candidates.
00:12:57,00:13:00,They've not been really able to organize things very quickly.
00:13:00,00:13:04,There was a guy who had the rebooting democracy party.
00:13:04,00:13:08,"He's standing in Cambridge and he's got this idea that he wants to change democracy, make"
00:13:08,00:13:09,it more direct.
00:13:09,00:13:14,"He wanted to fight all 650 seats in the election, but due to the snap election, he was only"
00:13:14,00:13:17,able to get into one.
00:13:17,00:13:24,"But his idea is to go into sortition, which is basically that everyone randomly gets chosen"
00:13:24,00:13:26,as an MP.
00:13:26,00:13:31,So rather than people becoming career MPs and deciding they want to work their way up into
00:13:31,00:13:35,"Parliament, you basically, it's like jury-duty, you get chosen."
00:13:35,00:13:36,And they did that in ancient Greece.
00:13:36,00:13:37,It's called air-sortition.
00:13:37,00:13:38,Right.
00:13:38,00:13:40,There's quite an old type of democracy.
00:13:40,00:13:43,So they put all our names in a hat and then they just pick it out.
00:13:43,00:13:45,"Just pick it out and they go, you're an MP."
00:13:45,00:13:46,Great.
00:13:46,00:13:47,And did that go well for ancient Greece?
00:13:47,00:13:48,Are they still doing that today?
00:13:48,00:13:49,Yeah.
00:13:49,00:13:53,The reason is it's called ancient Greece.
00:13:53,00:14:04,"This guy, Lord Biro, he actually 2014 in a by-election in Nottingham, he got 67 votes."
00:14:04,00:14:10,"One of his campaign promises were that he was going to try and get OAPs, a 30% discount"
00:14:10,00:14:13,at brothels.
00:14:13,00:14:16,He got more votes in that by-election than the Lib Dems.
00:14:16,00:14:20,Is it possible that they misheard and thought he was talking about Brussels?
00:14:20,00:14:25,Because brothels bureaucracy is what we need to stand up.
00:14:25,00:14:30,"Well, here's the other thing you might have liked him, actually Andy, because one of"
00:14:30,00:14:31,his other--
00:14:31,00:14:34,I'm getting on.
00:14:34,00:14:40,One of his other policies was that he wanted to protect public toilets from being wiped out.
00:14:40,00:14:42,So why does that be like public toilets?
00:14:42,00:14:45,"I just remember, ages ago, we were talking about public toilets, and you had a big thing"
00:14:45,00:14:49,about your fury of the high-street public toilet being wiped out.
00:14:49,00:14:54,"Well, a lot of them have been cut, and yeah, and it is a substantial problem for people."
00:14:54,00:14:57,"If you're trying to get around, you need to access to a public toilet as loads of people"
00:14:57,00:15:00,"do, and you don't want to go into a restaurant or a cafe or something, because often they're"
00:15:00,00:15:02,snippy about letting you use their lose.
00:15:02,00:15:03,And it's a massive problem.
00:15:03,00:15:04,That's actually a problem.
00:15:04,00:15:05,Exactly.
00:15:05,00:15:06,And the fact that you have to pay for it a lot as well.
00:15:06,00:15:07,Exactly.
00:15:07,00:15:11,"So in some American cities, they have laws, I think, now that you're not allowed to charge"
00:15:11,00:15:14,"for going to the toilet, or at least they're trying to get them in."
00:15:14,00:15:15,Yeah.
00:15:15,00:15:16,"So it is a big, big surface."
00:15:16,00:15:17,It is.
00:15:17,00:15:18,And Lord Murrow's on the case.
00:15:18,00:15:19,Lord has been talking about it.
00:15:19,00:15:20,This whole campaign.
00:15:20,00:15:21,It's not been Brexit.
00:15:21,00:15:22,Brexit.
00:15:22,00:15:23,Process.
00:15:23,00:15:24,Process.
00:15:24,00:15:25,Brussels.
00:15:25,00:15:26,Brussels.
00:15:26,00:15:27,Brussels.
00:15:27,00:15:28,These weird candidates.
00:15:28,00:15:29,Yeah.
00:15:29,00:15:33,So Lord Buckethead has been a big character in the election.
00:15:33,00:15:34,He's incredible.
00:15:34,00:15:38,He or someone dressed like him has been standing on and off since 1987.
00:15:38,00:15:39,No.
00:15:39,00:15:40,Yeah.
00:15:40,00:15:41,He first stood against Thatcher.
00:15:41,00:15:42,Yeah.
00:15:42,00:15:46,And he stood against Thatcher in 1987 with a promise to destroy Birmingham and replace it
00:15:46,00:15:47,with a starbase.
00:15:47,00:15:52,And he stood in this election saying we should defer the decision on whether to destroy
00:15:52,00:15:58,"Birmingham and replace it with a starbase until 2022, at least."
00:15:58,00:16:02,"So you were implying there, I think, that perhaps it's not the same Mr. Buckethead every,"
00:16:02,00:16:03,is it like Dr. Who?
00:16:03,00:16:04,He kind of regenerates.
00:16:04,00:16:05,I think it might be.
00:16:05,00:16:06,Yeah.
00:16:06,00:16:07,There's a chance.
00:16:07,00:16:08,Isn't that said?
00:16:08,00:16:10,They should have had more than one Darth Vader.
00:16:10,00:16:13,"You know, like send, you know, what?"
00:16:13,00:16:16,"Just like, you know, there was only ever one Darth Vader, but you could just put another guy"
00:16:16,00:16:17,in there for like minor battles.
00:16:17,00:16:18,That's very mask.
00:16:18,00:16:19,Yeah.
00:16:19,00:16:20,I guess so.
00:16:20,00:16:21,Yeah.
00:16:21,00:16:24,Why was they know like duplicate expendable Darth Vader?
00:16:24,00:16:25,Yeah.
00:16:25,00:16:26,Yeah.
00:16:26,00:16:27,Yeah.
00:16:27,00:16:34,"It was from Lord Buckethead this morning, 249, a new Buckethead record, something to celebrate"
00:16:34,00:16:35,eh?
00:16:35,00:16:37,It's so funny watching him.
00:16:37,00:16:41,"I mean, it was already a horrible moment for Theresa May, I think, by that point, when she"
00:16:41,00:16:44,"was standing there and what, and he was directly behind her."
00:16:44,00:16:45,Was it all he was?
00:16:45,00:16:47,"Oh no, actually, he was up quite on the edge."
00:16:47,00:16:48,"Yeah, he was."
00:16:48,00:16:51,"It wasn't as bad as Tim Farron, because he had Mr. Fishfinger stood behind him."
00:16:51,00:16:52,"Tim Farron, that was it."
00:16:52,00:16:53,Yeah.
00:16:53,00:16:56,"Okay, let's explain this for overseas listeners who wrote this."
00:16:56,00:17:00,"Okay, so like Dan says, we do have these very odd fringe candidates and some of them like"
00:17:00,00:17:01,to dress up.
00:17:01,00:17:04,"And Tim Farron, who's the head of the Liberal Democrats, who's the third biggest party in"
00:17:04,00:17:05,England.
00:17:05,00:17:09,"No, so who's the head of like the four of a fifth biggest party."
00:17:09,00:17:10,He was going up.
00:17:10,00:17:12,"Which actually you might need to explain to people in Britain as well, given the state of"
00:17:12,00:17:17,Tim Farron's campaign.
00:17:17,00:17:21,"He ran against a guy called Mr. Fishfinger, who dressed like a fishfinger."
00:17:21,00:17:26,"And he, there was a man called Mr. Fishfinger running because, wasn't there a..."
00:17:26,00:17:27,There was a Twitter poll.
00:17:27,00:17:33,"So there was a Twitter user called Skip Licker, who just asked the question."
00:17:33,00:17:35,Just a normal guy.
00:17:35,00:17:37,"First name, Skip, second name, Licker."
00:17:37,00:17:42,"And he asked, we were all completely losing the two of them."
00:17:42,00:17:43,Do you think that's his real name?
00:17:43,00:17:44,"Of course, this is his real name."
00:17:44,00:17:46,Why would it be his Twitter name if it wasn't his real name?
00:17:46,00:17:49,"It would be a weird thing to make up, wouldn't it?"
00:17:49,00:17:55,"Anyway, he asked the question to Twitter, who would you trust more MP Tim Farron or a fishfinger?"
00:17:55,00:17:58,And the fishfinger's got 95% of the vote.
00:17:58,00:18:00,And so this guy ran on...
00:18:00,00:18:02,Tim Farron almost lost his deposit in the...
00:18:02,00:18:06,Am I supposed to tell you that the fishfinger competition?
00:18:06,00:18:10,"But Mr. Fishfinger is amazing, so if you go on his website, I wanted to count the puns"
00:18:10,00:18:14,"on it for this, but it was going to take me too much time."
00:18:14,00:18:17,But he ran on the pledge to Hakebritten Great again.
00:18:17,00:18:23,He had a manifesto in which there was a polo key document.
00:18:23,00:18:25,He talks about his own cod-stituency.
00:18:25,00:18:31,"He has a list of endorsements, which is quite labour, but I guess fish have a dorsal fin."
00:18:31,00:18:32,That's a big deal for him.
00:18:32,00:18:36,"I was just wondering, we've explained all about the election, but do we need to explain"
00:18:36,00:18:40,for Farron listeners what a fishfinger is?
00:18:40,00:18:46,So a fishfinger is a piece of fish with breadcrumbs on it and deep fried.
00:18:46,00:18:47,It is delicious.
00:18:47,00:18:49,It's better than Tim Farron.
00:18:49,00:18:55,So the point is that he was standing behind Tim Farron as Tim Farron made his speech as
00:18:55,00:18:56,acceptance speech.
00:18:56,00:18:59,But Theresa May had also had to stand next to...
00:18:59,00:19:00,Buckethead.
00:19:00,00:19:02,Well Buckethead and someone dressed as Elmo.
00:19:02,00:19:03,Yes.
00:19:03,00:19:04,A massive Elmo.
00:19:04,00:19:07,"I think he only got three votes, although I'm going to do it."
00:19:07,00:19:08,Absolutely.
00:19:08,00:19:11,Buckethead wiped the floor with him then.
00:19:11,00:19:13,Buckethead absolutely destroyed Elmo at the selection.
00:19:13,00:19:16,"Well with the bucket for a head, he can do a lot of wiping eyes."
00:19:16,00:19:20,That's just a lot to the floor with him.
00:19:20,00:19:25,So I think we did a fact before on this podcast about people who got no votes in a general
00:19:25,00:19:29,"election, but it was before the rules were changed and then you were allowed to vote for"
00:19:29,00:19:30,yourself.
00:19:30,00:19:36,"But I think someone has got just one vote, a guy called Rainbow George Vice who stood"
00:19:36,00:19:40,in 13 different constituencies at one election before they changed the rules and said he can
00:19:40,00:19:43,"really at least stand in one election, one constituency."
00:19:43,00:19:49,"And he stands for the vote for yourself, Rainbow Dream Ticket Party and he won in 2005 in"
00:19:49,00:19:50,Cardiff North.
00:19:50,00:19:55,He got one vote and it wasn't from him either because he wasn't registered in that constituency.
00:19:55,00:19:56,Like Paul Nuttle.
00:19:56,00:19:59,Paul Nuttle didn't vote for himself because he's not registered in the constituency where
00:19:59,00:20:00,he was standing.
00:20:00,00:20:01,Really?
00:20:01,00:20:06,"Paul Nuttle, you mean X, UKIP leader, because as we came in here, he resigned, didn't he?"
00:20:06,00:20:07,That's true.
00:20:07,00:20:11,He caretaker between Farage leader of the...
00:20:11,00:20:12,Yeah.
00:20:12,00:20:15,"Did you know, I think Winston Churchill couldn't vote for himself in the 1945 election?"
00:20:15,00:20:16,Really?
00:20:16,00:20:18,"Yeah, so there was..."
00:20:18,00:20:19,"He lost, though."
00:20:19,00:20:20,Didn't he?
00:20:20,00:20:21,He sure did.
00:20:21,00:20:22,"Was it by one, though?"
00:20:22,00:20:23,"It was not by one, though."
00:20:23,00:20:29,"It was a bureaucratic cook-up, so there was a lot of disorganisation because it was the"
00:20:29,00:20:30,end of the war.
00:20:30,00:20:33,People had bigger fish to fry and they didn't have enough ballot papers.
00:20:33,00:20:36,Bigger fish fingers to fry.
00:20:36,00:20:39,So you had to use your ration card as your ballot paper to prove who you were and he
00:20:39,00:20:43,just wasn't registered and so he worked up and didn't have a legal vote.
00:20:43,00:20:48,"That's pretty bad after you've defeated fascism, so there's not bit, but it's process, isn't"
00:20:48,00:20:49,it?
00:20:49,00:20:50,It's all that process.
00:20:50,00:20:51,You've got to respect it.
00:20:51,00:20:55,"And do you know that the joint leader of the Green Party, so the Green Party has two"
00:20:55,00:21:00,dual leadership and one of the leaders is Guy called Jonathan Bartley and he's also a
00:21:00,00:21:04,drummer for a blues band called The Mustangs who've reached number five in the iTunes
00:21:04,00:21:05,Blues Chart.
00:21:05,00:21:06,Wow.
00:21:06,00:21:11,He's in 2010 for Best Band of the British Blues Awards and I've listened to them and they're
00:21:11,00:21:12,genuinely really good.
00:21:12,00:21:13,Really?
00:21:13,00:21:14,Yeah.
00:21:14,00:21:15,Really fun to listen to.
00:21:15,00:21:16,"So, well done, Jonathan."
00:21:16,00:21:23,"Just speaking of Green, but in the drug sense, Green, Mr. Biro, Lord Biro as well."
00:21:23,00:21:28,He wanted to nationalise marijuana cannabis and he wanted to call it British grass.
00:21:28,00:21:29,Very good.
00:21:29,00:21:30,Yeah.
00:21:30,00:21:37,"And just on process, Anna, if you are high on drugs or indeed drunk, they can't stop you"
00:21:37,00:21:38,from voting.
00:21:38,00:21:39,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:39,00:21:43,Even if you're the Queen.
00:21:43,00:21:46,"And also if you're wearing a bucket on your head or something like that, they can't stop"
00:21:46,00:21:47,you from voting.
00:21:47,00:21:48,You don't have to show your face.
00:21:48,00:21:49,You're kidding.
00:21:49,00:21:50,No.
00:21:50,00:21:51,"Oh, wow."
00:21:51,00:21:52,"Well, otherwise you wouldn't be on to vote in a bucket."
00:21:52,00:21:53,Yeah.
00:21:53,00:21:54,I guess not.
00:21:54,00:21:56,And we'd find out who Lord Buckethead is when he goes to vote.
00:21:56,00:21:58,There was a party that lost all of their deposits.
00:21:58,00:21:59,Okay.
00:21:59,00:22:05,"And they lost, between 1992 and 2001, they contested 500 seats in that time, they lost every"
00:22:05,00:22:06,single deposit.
00:22:06,00:22:07,You probably remember them.
00:22:07,00:22:08,The natural law party.
00:22:08,00:22:09,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:09,00:22:10,I remember that.
00:22:10,00:22:11,"Well, they're the levitating ones."
00:22:11,00:22:12,"They, yes."
00:22:12,00:22:13,They worked.
00:22:13,00:22:15,They were ones who thought they could never take.
00:22:15,00:22:16,They believed.
00:22:16,00:22:20,"So a lot of listeners might remember them, a lot of listeners might not."
00:22:20,00:22:23,"They believed you could do this thing called yogic flying, which is basically bouncing"
00:22:23,00:22:27,around with your legs crossed on your bottom with big hot water bottles underneath you.
00:22:27,00:22:28,"Oh, wow."
00:22:28,00:22:35,"But they believed that the first policy, right, if they had won in 1997 was that they would"
00:22:35,00:22:41,"make a special air service from the armed forces of 7,000 yogic flyers to hover in and fix"
00:22:41,00:22:43,everything in the country.
00:22:43,00:22:44,Wow.
00:22:44,00:22:45,I remember.
00:22:45,00:22:49,"I'm sure you told me, Sandy, that the trick to yogic flying has three steps."
00:22:49,00:22:50,"Oh, this is mine that I remember."
00:22:50,00:22:51,What was it?
00:22:51,00:22:52,One of the series.
00:22:52,00:22:53,You can say it then.
00:22:53,00:22:54,What was it?
00:22:54,00:22:55,Because I can't remember.
00:22:55,00:22:56,"Oh, it was just the yogic flying."
00:22:56,00:22:58,The way you get there is a three stage process.
00:22:58,00:23:03,So I think stage one is standing on one foot and stage two is being able to hop on one foot
00:23:03,00:23:05,and stage three is full levitation.
00:23:05,00:23:10,And I remember a proud statement by the yogic flying institute saying we have successfully
00:23:10,00:23:15,completed two of the three crucial steps.
00:23:15,00:23:24,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James."
00:23:24,00:23:30,"Okay, my fact this week is that Kenya have an election later this year and they're running"
00:23:30,00:23:36,"out of symbols for their candidates, which means that candidates are now using symbols"
00:23:36,00:23:42,"such as a milk packet, a termite and a robot."
00:23:42,00:23:43,Okay.
00:23:43,00:23:46,"Look at Samford's round with the robots as their main thing, this time round, didn't they?"
00:23:46,00:23:47,Yeah.
00:23:47,00:23:48,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:48,00:23:49,That was a good piece of satire.
00:23:49,00:23:51,"No, that was the joke about Theresa."
00:23:51,00:23:52,"Oh, it doesn't mess up."
00:23:52,00:23:54,"Guys, you two are tired, aren't you?"
00:23:54,00:24:00,That was a very strong joke and stable.
00:24:00,00:24:05,"So yeah, this actually happens in quite a lot of places in the world and it's how important"
00:24:05,00:24:08,it is to have a symbol next to your name.
00:24:08,00:24:12,So we know in Britain we have symbols for the Conservatives and Labour like the Rose and
00:24:12,00:24:16,the torch and in America they would have the elephants and the donkey and whatever they
00:24:16,00:24:18,have over there.
00:24:18,00:24:22,But in lots of places in the world you have a lot of low literacy and so if you can't read
00:24:22,00:24:27,the name of your preferred candidate you need to have the symbol and so they need a symbol
00:24:27,00:24:29,which is really memorable and striking.
00:24:29,00:24:32,They thought a termite would be there.
00:24:32,00:24:33,People want to vote for that.
00:24:33,00:24:34,I might.
00:24:34,00:24:35,I would.
00:24:35,00:24:36,What do you think about that?
00:24:36,00:24:40,It's very industrious and they're hardworking and they get the job done and they think that's
00:24:40,00:24:41,the idea.
00:24:41,00:24:43,They club together and they achieve things.
00:24:43,00:24:44,Yeah.
00:24:44,00:24:48,Was the milk carton half full or half empty or was it a full of milk?
00:24:48,00:24:53,That's how you look at it and that's what kind of person you want.
00:24:53,00:24:57,No it was just you couldn't look inside the milk carton because it was just a depiction
00:24:57,00:25:02,of one and actually this happens like I said quite a lot around the world in India.
00:25:02,00:25:08,The election commission a lot symbols to you and so there's a big long list of 164 available
00:25:08,00:25:13,symbols and you provide them three of them that you would like and then they choose one
00:25:13,00:25:15,of the three if it's available.
00:25:15,00:25:16,Yeah.
00:25:16,00:25:17,So cool.
00:25:17,00:25:21,They're all ones don't they like they have I was really not what was saying I think they've
00:25:21,00:25:25,modernised their symbols lately because they've recently added a sewing machine so I don't
00:25:25,00:25:29,know how modern they've got but they have scissors as one of the symbols you can choose a
00:25:29,00:25:30,stethoscope.
00:25:30,00:25:33,Do they have rock and paper?
00:25:33,00:25:38,It's a three way marginal.
00:25:38,00:25:40,An ice cream going for the youth vote.
00:25:40,00:25:41,Yeah.
00:25:41,00:25:42,Yeah.
00:25:42,00:25:43,They have.
00:25:43,00:25:44,They do it in Egypt as well.
00:25:44,00:25:45,I saw the actual symbols.
00:25:45,00:25:51,The picture here they use everything from a tractor to a ballistic missile to a tap
00:25:51,00:25:57,to this is my favourite one a mobile phone but the mobile phone symbol has a picture in
00:25:57,00:26:01,the mobile phone like a background and I'm pretty sure it's the politician who was running
00:26:01,00:26:06,but you know the thing with Egypt is it's not just that you choose three and they choose
00:26:06,00:26:10,for you it's actually completely random that they choose the symbol for you.
00:26:10,00:26:15,So you say I'm going to run in Egypt and they just randomly pick you a symbol.
00:26:15,00:26:19,So you'll have some politicians who think they're really kind of serious and you'll see
00:26:19,00:26:23,their poster and then it's got all of their picture and all of their stuff on there and
00:26:23,00:26:26,then there's like a picture of a banana next to it.
00:26:26,00:26:29,It's just ridiculous.
00:26:29,00:26:33,And like for instance it can be quite bad because there was a female MP who had a rocket
00:26:33,00:26:41,as her symbol just allocated randomly but rocket means hotty in Egyptian slang apparently.
00:26:41,00:26:45,So she was like well I can't do this I'm a serious MP you can't call me a hotty but
00:26:45,00:26:47,that wasn't random.
00:26:47,00:26:52,I bet it was an all-male panel that randomly selected those symbols at some point.
00:26:52,00:26:54,It's one of the symbols of penis.
00:26:54,00:26:59,"No, I think bananas as close as you get."
00:26:59,00:27:01,One of the ones I'm looking at here is a cannon camera.
00:27:01,00:27:05,Like it's actually got the cannon logo on it.
00:27:05,00:27:06,That's cool.
00:27:06,00:27:10,Well I look through the canyon list and they're really random so there's an electrical
00:27:10,00:27:15,"socket, there's some broken handcuffs, there's a steering wheel."
00:27:15,00:27:19,Broken handcuffs does not say to me tough on crime.
00:27:19,00:27:23,That says major cuts in crime.
00:27:23,00:27:27,So the canyon election is between Ahoru and NASA.
00:27:27,00:27:28,NASA?
00:27:28,00:27:29,What the American Space Agency?
00:27:29,00:27:32,"No, the National Super Alliance party."
00:27:32,00:27:37,So it's President Ahoru Kenyatta and everyone else is kind of gang together with a coalition
00:27:37,00:27:41,to go against him and they called themselves a National Super Alliance party known as
00:27:41,00:27:45,the abbreviation NASA and they're hoping that their coalition will unseat him.
00:27:45,00:27:47,I think the election is in August.
00:27:47,00:27:50,I'm glad I don't have any places unstable as Kenya where there's one party which has got
00:27:50,00:27:54,just about half the seats and one which is definitely trying to club together.
00:27:54,00:27:59,"This is going to go out of date so quickly, I don't know if I'm going to say it."
00:27:59,00:28:01,"We're going to date before tonight, will it?"
00:28:01,00:28:02,Might do actually.
00:28:02,00:28:03,"You know, no."
00:28:03,00:28:04,Yeah.
00:28:04,00:28:06,So just you mentioned brands in logos.
00:28:06,00:28:07,Yeah.
00:28:07,00:28:12,There are some places where companies get a vote so I was looking at how Hong Kong elections
00:28:12,00:28:13,work actually.
00:28:13,00:28:14,You might know this.
00:28:14,00:28:21,So the way Hong Kong constituencies are divided up is that five of their seats are geographical
00:28:21,00:28:27,seats and then all the rest are and then all the rest are like for companies and so they
00:28:27,00:28:33,get like an industry seat and they get an agricultural seat and they get a tourism seat
00:28:33,00:28:37,and it's really weird because that means that people like Canada air get a vote in the Hong
00:28:37,00:28:38,Kong elections.
00:28:38,00:28:39,Wow.
00:28:39,00:28:40,That is insane.
00:28:40,00:28:41,"Yeah, they do."
00:28:41,00:28:43,So all these airlines from all around the world get votes in the Hong Kong elections.
00:28:43,00:28:47,Does a company vote equal the same as a single person's vote?
00:28:47,00:28:48,I think it does.
00:28:48,00:28:49,Yeah.
00:28:49,00:28:50,Or it might be more in fact.
00:28:50,00:28:51,Wow.
00:28:51,00:28:52,Yeah.
00:28:52,00:28:53,It's really weird.
00:28:53,00:28:54,That's amazing.
00:28:54,00:28:55,I'm going to just sit as MPs.
00:28:55,00:28:58,"Because corporations by law are individuals, aren't they?"
00:28:58,00:28:59,Right.
00:28:59,00:29:02,"I mean, that's just a technical legal thing, but I think they are."
00:29:02,00:29:03,Yeah.
00:29:03,00:29:05,They'll be able to vote in this country.
00:29:05,00:29:06,But they're not standing up for themselves.
00:29:06,00:29:10,"They used to have, I think we've said this before, that universities used to get a vote."
00:29:10,00:29:11,Did they?
00:29:11,00:29:14,"So as well as the city of Oxford having an MP or maybe it was two MPs, actually at the time"
00:29:14,00:29:20,"it was each constituency had two MPs, Oxford and Cambridge each got to send an MP or two"
00:29:20,00:29:21,to the House of Commons.
00:29:21,00:29:22,It is.
00:29:22,00:29:23,And that meant that students used to get two votes.
00:29:23,00:29:28,"So it was until 1950, I think, 1948 and so it was Oxford got MP, Cambridge on MP, all"
00:29:28,00:29:31,the London ones got an MP and then just all the other Unies got an MP.
00:29:31,00:29:34,"And then yeah, it sounds like university challenges."
00:29:34,00:29:37,It morphed into that.
00:29:37,00:29:39,"Wow, that's amazing."
00:29:39,00:29:44,And then students didn't vote again until last night.
00:29:44,00:29:48,"So did you hear the thing recently about Donald Trump's logo, speaking of logos?"
00:29:48,00:29:50,"No, it's his logo."
00:29:50,00:29:55,"It's a crest and it has the word Trump on it, but it turns out that he just nicked it from"
00:29:55,00:30:00,somebody else and it was an old English crest and he took off the word integrity and put
00:30:00,00:30:04,"him on the word Trump, which is the most amazing metaphor."
00:30:04,00:30:05,So funny.
00:30:05,00:30:14,"Yeah, it was the husband of the woman who built Mar-a-Lago, got given this crest in 1939."
00:30:14,00:30:17,"Mar-a-Lago, his, you know, his second wife, his golf club."
00:30:17,00:30:20,"And the Trump organisation just took that coat of arms, changed the word, never asked permission"
00:30:20,00:30:21,from anyone.
00:30:21,00:30:27,"And then when he came back to the UK to open his horrible golf course, he, um, I'm sure it's"
00:30:27,00:30:31,a very nice golf course if anyone wants to give me free land of golf.
00:30:31,00:30:37,"Sorry, when the, when his fantastic golf course opened, um, he got in trouble because he hadn't"
00:30:37,00:30:42,registered the emblem according to the 1672 Lion King of Arms Act in Scotland.
00:30:42,00:30:45,"And then he tried to trademark and they said, no, that's already a thing here."
00:30:45,00:30:46,You can't do that.
00:30:46,00:30:47,Wow.
00:30:47,00:30:50,"So he had to invent a new crest solely to use in his Scottish golf courses, but in America"
00:30:50,00:30:53,he's still using the one he's nicked.
00:30:53,00:30:56,I think a lot of it is Americans listening to this would probably be quite amused by
00:30:56,00:30:59,"how uptight we are about our crests, I should think."
00:30:59,00:31:00,Yes.
00:31:00,00:31:03,"Well, the New York Times wrote in its cover, as they said, the British are known for taking"
00:31:03,00:31:07,Haraldry very seriously.
00:31:07,00:31:17,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy."
00:31:17,00:31:21,"My fact is that in the 19th century, one of England's constituencies had no people living"
00:31:21,00:31:27,in it and another one was underwater.
00:31:27,00:31:28,Wow.
00:31:28,00:31:33,"These are so, they're called rotten burrows, which are constituencies where there used to"
00:31:33,00:31:36,be a load of people living there and it made sense for them to have two MPs and then over
00:31:36,00:31:41,"time the population changes or the place goes derelict, but the rules haven't been updated"
00:31:41,00:31:43,so they still get MPs.
00:31:43,00:31:47,"And then it's really easy for someone, normally the landowner who owns the land, to just"
00:31:47,00:31:52,"take over the place, pick his own MPs and send them to the elsewhere."
00:31:52,00:31:53,That's amazing.
00:31:53,00:31:56,"Yeah, there's a black-adder episode, which is all about this, basically."
00:31:56,00:31:57,Really?
00:31:57,00:32:00,"And one of the constituencies that was underwater, Dunnich, is the inspiration for the thing"
00:32:00,00:32:02,"in the episode, which is called Dunnie on the World."
00:32:02,00:32:03,"Oh, really?"
00:32:03,00:32:04,Yes.
00:32:04,00:32:07,Do you know that Dunnich was the capital of the Kingdom of the East Angles?
00:32:07,00:32:08,What is it?
00:32:08,00:32:13,"Yeah, well, so it used to be a really important place and it was a port similar in size to"
00:32:13,00:32:18,"the 14th century London, according to Wikipedia, so it was a massive, massive place and that's"
00:32:18,00:32:19,why they had this boat.
00:32:19,00:32:20,Yeah.
00:32:20,00:32:26,"It's supposedly, yeah, exactly, rivaled the capital, and it's called Daniel like this, the"
00:32:26,00:32:28,British Atlantis.
00:32:28,00:32:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:29,00:32:30,What do you mean?
00:32:30,00:32:31,It is called that.
00:32:31,00:32:32,I'm calling it that now.
00:32:32,00:32:33,Who calls it that?
00:32:33,00:32:34,This guy.
00:32:34,00:32:37,But Atlantis isn't the thing about Atlantis that we don't know where it is.
00:32:37,00:32:38,We know where Dunnich is.
00:32:38,00:32:39,It just doesn't.
00:32:39,00:32:40,It's just not there anymore.
00:32:40,00:32:41,It fell into the sea.
00:32:41,00:32:47,"I forgot it fell into the sea, I thought it was just a place we couldn't find."
00:32:47,00:32:48,Yeah.
00:32:48,00:32:49,"No, it fell into the sea."
00:32:49,00:32:50,"Yeah, and it's the British Atlantis."
00:32:50,00:32:52,It's not claiming to be the Atlantis.
00:32:52,00:32:53,Yeah.
00:32:53,00:32:54,"Anyway, guys."
00:32:54,00:32:55,Yeah.
00:32:55,00:32:56,I got that.
00:32:56,00:32:57,But you got that.
00:32:57,00:32:58,"It's still there, okay, and it's underwater."
00:32:58,00:33:03,"And supposedly at midnight or at night, you can hear church bells dangling around in the"
00:33:03,00:33:04,water.
00:33:04,00:33:08,And that's just someone voting with their penis.
00:33:08,00:33:11,"And it had eight churches, it had two hospitals, and there's one man."
00:33:11,00:33:13,This was a piece in the India about ten years ago.
00:33:13,00:33:18,"He's called Stuart Bacon, and he's done about a thousand dives down there, and he has a map"
00:33:18,00:33:22,"which was printed five hundred years ago, and he can make his way around by touch."
00:33:22,00:33:23,Wow.
00:33:23,00:33:24,The city underwater.
00:33:24,00:33:25,That is extremely cool.
00:33:25,00:33:26,It's so cool.
00:33:26,00:33:27,"Yeah, that's amazing."
00:33:27,00:33:28,So what's left of it?
00:33:28,00:33:29,Is there like building?
00:33:29,00:33:31,There was almost nothing left.
00:33:31,00:33:33,Most of it was swept away in the two stores.
00:33:33,00:33:35,"There's like a church, a few houses, a pret."
00:33:35,00:33:40,Socky sandwiches.
00:33:40,00:33:44,"So it did that actually had about two hundred people living there, which is much larger than"
00:33:44,00:33:45,a load of other constituencies.
00:33:45,00:33:49,"And before they were reformed, there were fifty seats in the country which each had fewer"
00:33:49,00:33:50,than fifty voters living in them.
00:33:50,00:33:51,So funny.
00:33:51,00:33:56,"And it was the 1832 reform act, a bit of process for you to remember."
00:33:56,00:34:00,"And it was that act which got rid of these burrows, but it was also the act that excluded"
00:34:00,00:34:05,"women from voting, because until then it wasn't explicitly against the rules for women"
00:34:05,00:34:06,to vote.
00:34:06,00:34:08,"If they were landowners, they couldn't theory."
00:34:08,00:34:09,One did actually.
00:34:09,00:34:14,I think the first woman to vote was in the late 1500s because she was a widow of a big landowner
00:34:14,00:34:17,"who'd been the person who would nominate the person to go to Parliament, so she got"
00:34:17,00:34:18,to nominate.
00:34:18,00:34:20,"So, women got the vote in the 16th century."
00:34:20,00:34:24,"But did you know that Charles James Fox, who's a famous British Prime Minister, when he"
00:34:24,00:34:27,"became leader, he was too young to vote."
00:34:27,00:34:31,So he was 19 when he became leader in 1768 and the voting age was 21.
00:34:31,00:34:33,How does that work then?
00:34:33,00:34:38,"I guess just other people voted for, and his father bought the constituency for him."
00:34:38,00:34:39,There we go.
00:34:39,00:34:41,It was shit and epitaph.
00:34:41,00:34:42,Wow.
00:34:42,00:34:45,"So Aaron from the Green Party doing his A level history exam, back then might not have been"
00:34:45,00:34:46,able to vote either.
00:34:46,00:34:47,Yeah.
00:34:47,00:34:48,What do you think?
00:34:48,00:34:49,18 would have been too young.
00:34:49,00:34:50,Yeah.
00:34:50,00:34:51,Wow.
00:34:51,00:34:56,"So, one of the features of rotten burrows, which were a massive problem, obviously, in the"
00:34:56,00:35:00,"country, was this thing called pot walloping."
00:35:00,00:35:02,I had never heard of this.
00:35:02,00:35:03,It's so cool.
00:35:03,00:35:10,"So, before the reform act, then you could vote in certain areas if you were a pot wallapper."
00:35:10,00:35:14,"And what it meant was, is that you had a pot or a cauldron."
00:35:14,00:35:19,"And if you had a pot that was big enough, if you had a pot, a proper big cooking pot, it"
00:35:19,00:35:22,showed that you had a hearth that was big enough to put the pot in.
00:35:22,00:35:25,"And if you had a hearth that was big enough to put the pot in, then you obviously had"
00:35:25,00:35:29,the freehold of a house and therefore you were considered responsible enough to vote.
00:35:29,00:35:31,"So, could you not just get a knockoff pot off either?"
00:35:31,00:35:32,Yeah.
00:35:32,00:35:33,You would have thought so.
00:35:33,00:35:34,Yeah.
00:35:34,00:35:35,Did you have to bring a pot with you to the voting boat?
00:35:35,00:35:39,"That's why nobody voted, because people were dragging these enormous heavy cauldrons around"
00:35:39,00:35:40,the streets.
00:35:40,00:35:44,They actually had one guy called Lord Culdron Head.
00:35:44,00:35:51,"Isn't it the case that they had to, if you were voting, it was done in public, one by"
00:35:51,00:35:52,one.
00:35:52,00:35:53,Yes.
00:35:53,00:35:54,It's done in public.
00:35:54,00:35:55,And it took ages.
00:35:55,00:35:56,Right.
00:35:56,00:35:58,But did you have to declare it sort of to everyone or was it a secret ballot?
00:35:58,00:35:59,"No, no, you did."
00:35:59,00:36:01,The ballot wasn't introduced until the 1870.
00:36:01,00:36:02,Wow.
00:36:02,00:36:05,"That meant that you could obviously, people could sort of bribe you."
00:36:05,00:36:06,Yeah.
00:36:06,00:36:09,"It was called treating your constituents, you get them free food and drink basically."
00:36:09,00:36:10,Yeah.
00:36:10,00:36:13,And sometimes that would cost so much money that only one person could afford to stand
00:36:13,00:36:14,in the seat anyway.
00:36:14,00:36:15,Hmm.
00:36:15,00:36:18,"People used to sign their ballot papers, actually, because that was a good, because the"
00:36:18,00:36:20,person who had been elected would go through the ballot papers afterwards and look at
00:36:20,00:36:24,"who voted for them and be like, ""Oh, Johnny, I'll give him a little present."""
00:36:24,00:36:27,Mr. penis is voted for him.
00:36:27,00:36:34,"And if you were super rich, presumably you could gift people pots to allow them to vote for"
00:36:34,00:36:35,you.
00:36:35,00:36:36,To give them the franchise.
00:36:36,00:36:37,Yeah.
00:36:37,00:36:38,To gain votes.
00:36:38,00:36:39,Yeah.
00:36:39,00:36:40,"Okay, get this."
00:36:40,00:36:41,The 1784 election.
00:36:41,00:36:46,Voting opened in the Westminster constituency on the 1st of April and it closed on the 17th
00:36:46,00:36:47,of May.
00:36:47,00:36:48,What?
00:36:48,00:36:49,What?
00:36:49,00:36:51,"Took nearly two months just to gather the votes, because they didn't have this thing, because"
00:36:51,00:36:55,obviously they didn't have mass communication and they didn't need to do the election all
00:36:55,00:36:56,"on the same day, basically."
00:36:56,00:37:01,But Sondland still turned in all their votes by 10 p.m. that day.
00:37:01,00:37:04,"Sondland's like the swatty kid in the class, isn't it?"
00:37:04,00:37:05,"Hey, not this year, though."
00:37:05,00:37:06,"I know, they got this."
00:37:06,00:37:07,They got this.
00:37:07,00:37:10,"Oh, so quickly explain that for overseas people, Sondland usually."
00:37:10,00:37:15,"So the polls close at 10 o'clock, and Sondland for the last 20 years has always been the first"
00:37:15,00:37:19,"constituency to give their result, and they usually do it by about 11 or something like"
00:37:19,00:37:20,that.
00:37:20,00:37:21,"They're really, really quick."
00:37:21,00:37:22,"They're really, really quick."
00:37:22,00:37:23,But this was the first year in ages.
00:37:23,00:37:25,"In my lifetime, I think that Newcastle has beaten them."
00:37:25,00:37:26,Yeah.
00:37:26,00:37:30,"And as a Newcastle fan, I was thrilled with the result of that derby between them."
00:37:30,00:37:34,"It's been a bad year for Sondland all together, isn't it, because they got relegated from the"
00:37:34,00:37:36,Premier League and now this.
00:37:36,00:37:38,And Newcastle got promoted from the championships.
00:37:38,00:37:40,"So in your face, Sondland."
00:37:40,00:37:41,Wow.
00:37:41,00:37:44,"We're not doing a tall day in Sondland, are we?"
00:37:44,00:37:48,Not anymore.
00:37:48,00:37:49,Should we wrap up?
00:37:49,00:37:50,Sure.
00:37:50,00:37:51,"Yeah, let's go to bed."
00:37:51,00:37:52,Yeah.
00:37:52,00:37:53,"Oh, wait."
00:37:53,00:37:54,Can I tell you?
00:37:54,00:37:55,"Oh, no."
00:37:55,00:37:58,I'm just a bit more processed to finish off.
00:37:58,00:38:01,"This is, I was just really surprised about this."
00:38:01,00:38:06,"Supermarkets, people who shop in certain supermarkets vote for certain people."
00:38:06,00:38:11,"And where would you guess, Aldi and Little, how their loyalty is these days?"
00:38:11,00:38:15,"They're budget shops, so I would imagine it's people on a tighter budget, so I'd say Labour."
00:38:15,00:38:16,Yeah.
00:38:16,00:38:17,"What a thought, so wouldn't you?"
00:38:17,00:38:18,It's the Tories.
00:38:18,00:38:19,There's Tories voters.
00:38:19,00:38:21,"So actually, the Tories have all supermarkets shoppers."
00:38:21,00:38:23,I don't know where Labour voters are shopping.
00:38:23,00:38:28,"Tories shop in Tesco's, Waitrose, St. Breeze, Aldi and Little are now all conservative."
00:38:28,00:38:30,And it's just Morrison's and Astor that they've got the Labour vote.
00:38:30,00:38:35,"But you do hear about Little Britain, don't you?"
00:38:35,00:38:39,"Ah, true Labour voters grow all their own produce on their allotments."
00:38:39,00:38:46,"Okay, that's it."
00:38:46,00:38:48,That's all we can do.
00:38:48,00:38:49,We need to go to sleep now.
00:38:49,00:38:50,We are knackered.
00:38:50,00:38:53,I need to close my working eye.
00:38:53,00:38:56,And we will be back again next week with another episode.
00:38:56,00:39:00,"Until then, you can reach us and chat more to us about the British elections if you want"
00:39:00,00:39:01,on our Twitter accounts.
00:39:01,00:39:10,"I'm on @Streiberland, James, @SkipLicca, @EggShate, Andy, Andrew Hunter M, and Shazinski."

00:39:16,00:39:17,You can go to our website.
00:39:17,00:39:20,No such thing as a fish.com where you can find all of our previous episodes.
00:39:20,00:39:26,"There's also our tour dates for the UK, and there's also a link to our book which is coming"
00:39:26,00:39:28,out in November.
00:39:28,00:39:30,We'll be back again next week with another episode.
00:39:30,00:39:31,We'll see you then.
