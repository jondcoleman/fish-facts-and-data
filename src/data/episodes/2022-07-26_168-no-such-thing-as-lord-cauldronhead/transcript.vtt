00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.040
 [nodding sound]

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.020
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.560
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden also coming to you from the morning

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.720
 after the 2017 British General Election.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.920
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.220
 I'm sitting here with Ani Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.320
 Andrew Hunter Murray, so I'm tired.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.160
 Andrew Hunter.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.560
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.760
 I'm sitting here with Ani Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.400
 from the last night, the evening of the election.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.640
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.560
 Hey Dan, you sound a bit tired.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.400
 I'm very tired.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.400
 But which one of us stayed up the latest and the longest?

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.880
 Well, the problem was, I didn't watch it on TV.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.480
 I think all of us stayed watching it on TV.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.480
 We made the mistake of watching it on plus one, so you got even less sleep than the rest of us.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.640
 We watched it on my iPhone in bed with the lights off.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.280
 My left eye, which did all the watching, because my right eye was in a pillow, is really

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.280
 twitching right now.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.520
 But because it's on the left, it'll be very happy with the results.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.320
 Okay, starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.800
 Yeah, my fact is the really relevant to this result fact, all forfeited election deposits

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.280
 go straight to the queen.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.800
 And this is just the thing I found out.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.380
 I was reading the Electoral Commission Guide for Returning Officers, as you do in an exciting

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.380
 time like this.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.320
 You've got to do exciting things.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.240
 And yeah, there was just a rule in it.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.560
 It's like for returning officers.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.200
 So for anyone, internationally listening returning officers are the people who are responsible

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.080
 in every constituency for like, organising and announcing the election.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.440
 And this is the long guide, as to exactly how they go about doing that.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.160
 What it says in the guide is, if a candidate does not poll more than 5% of the total number

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.080
 of valid votes cast, that deposit will be forfeited, you must send any forfeited deposits

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.080
 to her majesty.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.760
 So the deposits are £500, that people put up if they want to be an MP, again for international

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.760
 listeners.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.160
 And then if you get under 5%, you fall for the deposit, but I didn't realise it went

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.160
 to her majesty.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
 I can't find anything else about this online.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.160
 It's amazing though.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.120
 In 2010, you kept alone lost £229,000 in deposits.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.120
 No way.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.120
 Wow.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.120
 And the green party lost £163,500.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.120
 Of course it is.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.120
 No wonder the Queen's so rich.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.120
 Yeah, no.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.120
 In 2010, there was about a million pounds in lost deposits.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.120
 That is a lot.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.120
 It is a lot.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.120
 Wow.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.640
 The idea of this deposit is to stop frivolous campaigns, isn't it?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.640
 Yeah, but it does a very good job.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.960
 I think the Monterey from Looney Party would agree.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.120
 In 1983, they had a look at this, the Home Affairs Committee to see if it was, you know,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.560
 if it was too much and if it was stopping poorer people from running.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.480
 And they kind of thought, well, maybe it is, but actually it's worth it because for your

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.960
 500 quid, even if you lose, you get free postage for your campaign address and you get free

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.760
 use of buildings for public meetings and you get a great deal of publicity, they said.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.960
 So almost the 500 quid is worth it.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.400
 And they actually recommended it should be up to £1,000.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.400
 Oh, really?

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.400
 But it never was.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.120
 Well, I might just enter a not even campaign just for the sake of getting some publicity

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.680
 for myself and some free buildings.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.200
 We're going to enter you, weren't we?

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.200
 Because you live in the same constituency as Jeremy Corbyn, but he did quite well in the

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200
 swan didn't he?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200
 So you could have swung it out.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.200
 I could have.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.080
 Are they saying that he did the best that any politician has ever done?

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.080
 He got the highest.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.720
 He didn't, he didn't win at the election, but in his constituency.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.160
 Yeah, he got the highest ever vote in isn't enough.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.160
 Wow.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.160
 Which is the smallest constituency.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160
 I didn't know.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.160
 It's also mine.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.160
 So I had a personal interest in that.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.160
 Really?

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.160
 Yeah.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.160
 It's a smallest package.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.600
 Do you know what the largest one is?

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600
 No, what?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.960
 It's Ross, Sky and Lock Arbor in Scotland, which is 1,632 times larger than Islington North.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.960
 Really?

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.960
 Yeah, huh.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.560
 And so I worked that out and I worked out that if Jeremy Corbyn's allotment was increased

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.200
 by that amount, then it would be the size of the Vatican city.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200
 Wow.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.800
 Maybe it will be now.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.720
 Just on the Queen very quickly, so overseas listeners might not know this, but the Queen's

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.560
 not allowed to vote in these elections.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.560
 She is allowed to vote.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.560
 Of course she just doesn't.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.400
 Sorry, she chooses not to, and every, every one of...

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.400
 She doesn't care.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400
 But these are real problems in this country.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.400
 It goes right up to the top.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.400
 Right?

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.400
 Because she's old.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.400
 You know, you'd think she would care more.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.400
 Of course, she doesn't want the votes to go higher, because she wants this delicious money

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.400
 from the last department.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.400
 Exactly.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.400
 But also...

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.040
 So sorry, you've just got 4.999% of the vote in the constituency.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.400
 See the Queen going, yes.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.080
 But she spends most of her time in these periods, and for the referendum and so on, just denying

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.080
 that she has an opinion, which I love.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.120
 Every single royal member just seems to spend their whole period any time they're mentioned

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.920
 in the press in these periods, denying that what they've said is, in some way, alluding

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.080
 to an opinion about what way people should vote for it.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.920
 But they can have opinions on things like catch up or mayonnaise, or, you know, do you

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.520
 prefer a buzzcut or long hair?

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.120
 They're just not supposed to have political views.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.120
 Yes, no, exactly.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.120
 But not any opinion.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.120
 I've obviously been...

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.640
 Have you heard of Prince Charles?

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.640
 Consistently raised to everyone who will...

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.440
 He has been leaked, aren't they?

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.080
 He hasn't openly done that.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.080
 He doesn't know that.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.280
 That reminds me of the Emperor of Japan, Akihito, who's not allowed to give any opinions

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.200
 on politics at all, not even just in elections, just never ever, and it's in the constitution

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.360
 that comes from the end of the Second World War.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.840
 And so he wasn't allowed to abdicate.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.680
 He wasn't allowed to say, "I want to abdicate," he had to kind of do an announcement alluding

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.100
 to the fact that he might want to, and then people had to kind of infer from what he said

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.100
 that he wanted to abdicate.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.100
 So, wink, wink.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.100
 That stuff, wow.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.100
 Pretty tight.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.100
 You didn't...

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.180
 You may have not seen that in the news last night, but they passed that he is now allowed

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.180
 to abdicate.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.180
 Oh, really?

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.180
 Yeah, yeah.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.180
 I was in the news last night, hope.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.180
 Oh, I didn't see that.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.180
 Yeah.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.880
 But on, like, process, weird election, an electoral process, if it's a tie, it comes down to a coin

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.800
 to us, which obviously never happens, but there was that guy in Anne's constituency, so one

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.600
 of our colleagues Anne used to live up North, and it's in North East 5, and I think the person

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.620
 who won was an S.M.P candidate who won by two votes this morning, right?

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.620
 Yeah.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.620
 Wow.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.620
 Two votes.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.620
 Wow.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.620
 Oh, my God.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.620
 So that's just one person, isn't it?

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.620
 Yeah.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.620
 Putting the X in the wrong body.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.620
 Exactly.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.620
 Did you guys see the Green Party candidate from...

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.620
 Ashfield?

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.620
 No.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.940
 Okay, so his name's Aaron Rangy.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:48.500
 He had to leave the count as it was going on because he had to get home to get some sleep

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.220
 because he has an A-level history exam at nine o'clock this morning, so he's 18 years

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.220
 old.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.900
 He's the Green Party candidate, and it just got too late for him, so I can't stay for the

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.900
 final count.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.900
 Got my exam.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.940
 They should let you off having a history exam if you're making history.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.940
 Yes.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.940
 I'll see definitely did in the Green Party.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:08.940
 Yeah.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.780
 Yeah, I'd take it he won the seat presumably, right?

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.780
 I have no idea.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.820
 No, I mean, he didn't win the seat.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.820
 Okay.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.420
 You know the deposit thing that we were starting off with, did you know it used to be a lot

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.420
 harder?

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:27.180
 So, until I think 1918, or definitely in 1918, it was £150 that you had to put up, but

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.460
 obviously that was a lot more money then.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.460
 Yeah.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.460
 It was about...

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.460
 Yeah.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:38.420
 And you had to win 12.5% of the vote, otherwise you would forfeit your deposit, so it was a much

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.420
 higher barrier.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:45.620
 Another place you need to get 12.5% is in Japan, and do you know how much the Japanese deposit

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.820
 is that you have to pay?

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.820
 No.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:55.300
 It's 3 million yen, which is the equivalent of £21,064, and you need 12.5%.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.700
 But then they don't get all those hilarious fringe candidates that can entertain them during

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.100
 a tedious campaign, right?

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.420
 I suppose not, unless they're extremely rich.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.580
 Very wealthy ones.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.580
 Yeah.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.460
 Just another thing on, on process.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.460
 If you...

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.820
 I really think, I think process was a big winner in this election, don't you?

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.140
 It was certainly what I voted for, I just wrote it in my box.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.820
 I love that I'm doing this, the way I'm doing it.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.980
 So I didn't realise that actually, as long as you make your intention clear on the ballot

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.980
 paper, then your vote counts, so I thought you had to do a cross or maybe a tick.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:35.220
 But if you draw a penis, as long as it's within the lines of the candidate in whose box

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.060
 you've drawn a penis, it does count as a vote.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:43.860
 And so there was, for instance, there was a Tory MP, Glenn Davis in 2015, who held onto

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.340
 the Montgomeryshire constituency in Wales, and he personally thanked the person who voted

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.740
 for him by drawing a penis in his box.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.900
 But it sort of depends how you feel about penises, doesn't it?

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.900
 You're right.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.900
 So do you think...

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.260
 When people call you a dick, Andy, do you look at them and think, "Yeah, but he probably

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.260
 likes dick."

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:12.740
 Actually, on that spoiling vote thing, in the last British election 2015, there were 97,870

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.980
 spoiled votes, right?

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:19.820
 The last time the Gambia had an election, there were two really spoiled ballots in the whole

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.820
 country.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.820
 What?

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.740
 Because the Gambian voting system is really cool.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.500
 If you've got three candidates, you have three buckets next to each other, you've got

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.300
 three barrels next to each other, and they've got a little shoot at the top, and you push...

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.020
 You get given a marble, and you push the marble through the little shoot at the top, and

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.060
 it dings a bell, so everyone can hear it.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.220
 So how do you spoil your vote?

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.220
 Now, do you put your penis in there?

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.860
 To spoil your vote.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:49.220
 You have to balance a marble on top of the barrel, and only two people did it in the whole

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.220
 country.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.220
 No, that's a fraction.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.220
 Yeah, what?

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.220
 You kidding?

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.220
 That's incredible.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.220
 It's a great system.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.220
 They've had the system since the '60s.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.220
 It really works for them.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.740
 If you spoil your ballot by putting your penis in the tube, then the electoral guy comes

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.700
 along and goes, "Do you like penises, though?"

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.700
 The bell keeps going, "Ling-ling-ling-ling-ling."

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:14.220
 That's actually more akin to the word ballot, isn't it, because ballot comes from, I think,

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.500
 a word that means little ball, because it used to be that you actually put a ball into

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.500
 a box.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.500
 That's right.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.500
 I think so.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.500
 We can start thinking about moving on.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.500
 Yeah, shall we?

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.500
 What should we move on?

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.660
 That's a lot more stuff to say, one process, I know.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.420
 So much process.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.420
 I do like the first ballot box.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.420
 It's just got more presents.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.300
 I know you said it in just, that's really hoping to move on.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.700
 Look, this is a great fact, guys.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.220
 It's not all about this election.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:47.500
 The first ever secret ballot when it was introduced in the UK was in 1872, and the seal

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.580
 of the first ballot box was made with a licorice stamp, so there are famous licorices

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:55.580
 in the UK that are called Pontifract Licorices, and they're like black sweets, and they have

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.300
 a stamp on them, which says Pontifract Licorice has a picture of Pontifract Castle, and when

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.980
 they had to close the first ballot box in 1872, they had to whip one over.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.300
 It was in Pontifract, so they got one of those stamps over from Pontifract, and they stamped

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.300
 it with a licorice stamp, so...

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.300
 That's really cool.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.300
 That's very cool.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.300
 ...liquish logo on it.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.300
 That's a good process.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.300
 Great process, guys.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:25.900
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:32.660
 My fact this week is that only one political party in this 2017 election offered to do anything

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.660
 about yetis.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.180
 Oh, did they get your votes?

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.180
 I didn't.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.500
 I've only found out about it too late.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.500
 Yeah.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.500
 What's the party?

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.020
 The party goes by a number of names, actually.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:49.740
 It's sort of formally, as its main headline name known as "Church of the militant Elvis Party."

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.180
 It's also known as the "Buspass Elvis Party."

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.780
 Oh, yeah, those ones.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:58.620
 This year they ran under the title "Elvis" and the Yeti Himalayan Preservation Party.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.620
 So there is a common theme that runs through their names, isn't it?

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.620
 Yes.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.620
 Party.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.620
 Yes.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.620
 Yeah.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:13.360
 Yeah, so the guy who was running is a guy called David Bishop, aka Lord Biro, and he was

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.780
 promising this year that if they were voted in that he would do stuff about the potential

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:23.080
 threats from North Korea and launching missiles, because if they miss-launched missile in

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.080
 the wrong direction, it might hit Tibet and harm Yetis.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.760
 So that was his protection policy that he wants to get in on.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.720
 And he actually was stepping down.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.800
 He said he was going to step down completely and then did his own personal eutern on it

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.940
 because Theresa May called a general election when he thought I'm not going to be in

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.620
 a fit state in a few years to come.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.060
 But then he said when he heard that Mick Jagger was going on tour again this autumn, he thought,

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.500
 OK, I can run to.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:57.060
 And so actually this snap election has been bad news for these kind of slightly unusual candidates.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.100
 They've not been really able to organize things very quickly.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.420
 There was a guy who had the rebooting democracy party.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.300
 He's standing in Cambridge and he's got this idea that he wants to change democracy, make

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.860
 it more direct.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.560
 He wanted to fight all 650 seats in the election, but due to the snap election, he was only

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.860
 able to get into one.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:24.540
 But his idea is to go into sortition, which is basically that everyone randomly gets chosen

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.460
 as an MP.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.300
 So rather than people becoming career MPs and deciding they want to work their way up into

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.220
 Parliament, you basically, it's like jury-duty, you get chosen.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.740
 And they did that in ancient Greece.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.740
 It's called air-sortition.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.740
 Right.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.740
 There's quite an old type of democracy.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.860
 So they put all our names in a hat and then they just pick it out.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.740
 Just pick it out and they go, you're an MP.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.740
 Great.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.740
 And did that go well for ancient Greece?

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.740
 Are they still doing that today?

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.740
 Yeah.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.780
 The reason is it's called ancient Greece.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:14:04.380
 This guy, Lord Biro, he actually 2014 in a by-election in Nottingham, he got 67 votes.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:10.220
 One of his campaign promises were that he was going to try and get OAPs, a 30% discount

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.060
 at brothels.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.060
 He got more votes in that by-election than the Lib Dems.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:20.660
 Is it possible that they misheard and thought he was talking about Brussels?

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:25.860
 Because brothels bureaucracy is what we need to stand up.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.340
 Well, here's the other thing you might have liked him, actually Andy, because one of

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.340
 his other--

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.220
 I'm getting on.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:40.180
 One of his other policies was that he wanted to protect public toilets from being wiped out.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.620
 So why does that be like public toilets?

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.740
 I just remember, ages ago, we were talking about public toilets, and you had a big thing

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.180
 about your fury of the high-street public toilet being wiped out.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:54.180
 Well, a lot of them have been cut, and yeah, and it is a substantial problem for people.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.420
 If you're trying to get around, you need to access to a public toilet as loads of people

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.460
 do, and you don't want to go into a restaurant or a cafe or something, because often they're

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.260
 snippy about letting you use their lose.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.260
 And it's a massive problem.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.260
 That's actually a problem.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.260
 Exactly.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.740
 And the fact that you have to pay for it a lot as well.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.740
 Exactly.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.460
 So in some American cities, they have laws, I think, now that you're not allowed to charge

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.380
 for going to the toilet, or at least they're trying to get them in.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.380
 Yeah.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.380
 So it is a big, big surface.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.380
 It is.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.380
 And Lord Murrow's on the case.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.380
 Lord has been talking about it.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.380
 This whole campaign.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.380
 It's not been Brexit.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.380
 Brexit.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.380
 Process.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.380
 Process.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.380
 Brussels.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.380
 Brussels.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.380
 Brussels.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.380
 These weird candidates.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.380
 Yeah.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:33.620
 So Lord Buckethead has been a big character in the election.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.620
 He's incredible.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.220
 He or someone dressed like him has been standing on and off since 1987.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.220
 No.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.220
 Yeah.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.700
 He first stood against Thatcher.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.700
 Yeah.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.820
 And he stood against Thatcher in 1987 with a promise to destroy Birmingham and replace it

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.820
 with a starbase.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:52.420
 And he stood in this election saying we should defer the decision on whether to destroy

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:58.060
 Birmingham and replace it with a starbase until 2022, at least.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.580
 So you were implying there, I think, that perhaps it's not the same Mr. Buckethead every,

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.580
 is it like Dr. Who?

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.580
 He kind of regenerates.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.580
 I think it might be.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.580
 Yeah.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.580
 There's a chance.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.580
 Isn't that said?

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.380
 They should have had more than one Darth Vader.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.100
 You know, like send, you know, what?

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.300
 Just like, you know, there was only ever one Darth Vader, but you could just put another guy

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.300
 in there for like minor battles.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.300
 That's very mask.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.300
 Yeah.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.300
 I guess so.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.300
 Yeah.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.020
 Why was they know like duplicate expendable Darth Vader?

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.020
 Yeah.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.020
 Yeah.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.020
 Yeah.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:34.540
 It was from Lord Buckethead this morning, 249, a new Buckethead record, something to celebrate

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.540
 eh?

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.140
 It's so funny watching him.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.500
 I mean, it was already a horrible moment for Theresa May, I think, by that point, when she

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.900
 was standing there and what, and he was directly behind her.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:45.900
 Was it all he was?

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.500
 Oh no, actually, he was up quite on the edge.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.500
 Yeah, he was.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.900
 It wasn't as bad as Tim Farron, because he had Mr. Fishfinger stood behind him.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.900
 Tim Farron, that was it.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.900
 Yeah.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.100
 Okay, let's explain this for overseas listeners who wrote this.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:00.260
 Okay, so like Dan says, we do have these very odd fringe candidates and some of them like

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.260
 to dress up.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.620
 And Tim Farron, who's the head of the Liberal Democrats, who's the third biggest party in

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.620
 England.

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:09.180
 No, so who's the head of like the four of a fifth biggest party.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.180
 He was going up.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.620
 Which actually you might need to explain to people in Britain as well, given the state of

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:17.220
 Tim Farron's campaign.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.420
 He ran against a guy called Mr. Fishfinger, who dressed like a fishfinger.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:26.300
 And he, there was a man called Mr. Fishfinger running because, wasn't there a...

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.300
 There was a Twitter poll.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:33.140
 So there was a Twitter user called Skip Licker, who just asked the question.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.140
 Just a normal guy.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.500
 First name, Skip, second name, Licker.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.220
 And he asked, we were all completely losing the two of them.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.700
 Do you think that's his real name?

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.700
 Of course, this is his real name.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.980
 Why would it be his Twitter name if it wasn't his real name?

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.140
 It would be a weird thing to make up, wouldn't it?

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:55.820
 Anyway, he asked the question to Twitter, who would you trust more MP Tim Farron or a fishfinger?

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.140
 And the fishfinger's got 95% of the vote.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.180
 And so this guy ran on...

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.620
 Tim Farron almost lost his deposit in the...

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.780
 Am I supposed to tell you that the fishfinger competition?

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.540
 But Mr. Fishfinger is amazing, so if you go on his website, I wanted to count the puns

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:14.020
 on it for this, but it was going to take me too much time.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.460
 But he ran on the pledge to Hakebritten Great again.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:23.100
 He had a manifesto in which there was a polo key document.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.900
 He talks about his own cod-stituency.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:31.060
 He has a list of endorsements, which is quite labour, but I guess fish have a dorsal fin.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.580
 That's a big deal for him.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:36.460
 I was just wondering, we've explained all about the election, but do we need to explain

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.820
 for Farron listeners what a fishfinger is?

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:46.180
 So a fishfinger is a piece of fish with breadcrumbs on it and deep fried.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.180
 It is delicious.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.700
 It's better than Tim Farron.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:55.900
 So the point is that he was standing behind Tim Farron as Tim Farron made his speech as

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.900
 acceptance speech.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.380
 But Theresa May had also had to stand next to...

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.380
 Buckethead.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.260
 Well Buckethead and someone dressed as Elmo.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.260
 Yes.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.260
 A massive Elmo.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.620
 I think he only got three votes, although I'm going to do it.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.620
 Absolutely.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.300
 Buckethead wiped the floor with him then.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.420
 Buckethead absolutely destroyed Elmo at the selection.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.260
 Well with the bucket for a head, he can do a lot of wiping eyes.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:20.780
 That's just a lot to the floor with him.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:25.460
 So I think we did a fact before on this podcast about people who got no votes in a general

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.060
 election, but it was before the rules were changed and then you were allowed to vote for

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.060
 yourself.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:36.620
 But I think someone has got just one vote, a guy called Rainbow George Vice who stood

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:40.820
 in 13 different constituencies at one election before they changed the rules and said he can

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.860
 really at least stand in one election, one constituency.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:49.060
 And he stands for the vote for yourself, Rainbow Dream Ticket Party and he won in 2005 in

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.060
 Cardiff North.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:55.060
 He got one vote and it wasn't from him either because he wasn't registered in that constituency.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.060
 Like Paul Nuttle.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.900
 Paul Nuttle didn't vote for himself because he's not registered in the constituency where

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.900
 he was standing.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:01.900
 Really?

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:06.460
 Paul Nuttle, you mean X, UKIP leader, because as we came in here, he resigned, didn't he?

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.460
 That's true.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.140
 He caretaker between Farage leader of the...

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.140
 Yeah.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.900
 Did you know, I think Winston Churchill couldn't vote for himself in the 1945 election?

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.900
 Really?

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.900
 Yeah, so there was...

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.900
 He lost, though.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:20.900
 Didn't he?

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:21.900
 He sure did.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.900
 Was it by one, though?

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.900
 It was not by one, though.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:29.220
 It was a bureaucratic cook-up, so there was a lot of disorganisation because it was the

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.220
 end of the war.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.780
 People had bigger fish to fry and they didn't have enough ballot papers.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.340
 Bigger fish fingers to fry.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.820
 So you had to use your ration card as your ballot paper to prove who you were and he

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.660
 just wasn't registered and so he worked up and didn't have a legal vote.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.540
 That's pretty bad after you've defeated fascism, so there's not bit, but it's process, isn't

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.540
 it?

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.540
 It's all that process.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.540
 You've got to respect it.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.780
 And do you know that the joint leader of the Green Party, so the Green Party has two

00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:00.300
 dual leadership and one of the leaders is Guy called Jonathan Bartley and he's also a

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:04.620
 drummer for a blues band called The Mustangs who've reached number five in the iTunes

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.620
 Blues Chart.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.620
 Wow.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:11.460
 He's in 2010 for Best Band of the British Blues Awards and I've listened to them and they're

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.780
 genuinely really good.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:13.780
 Really?

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:14.780
 Yeah.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:15.780
 Really fun to listen to.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.780
 So, well done, Jonathan.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:23.620
 Just speaking of Green, but in the drug sense, Green, Mr. Biro, Lord Biro as well.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.860
 He wanted to nationalise marijuana cannabis and he wanted to call it British grass.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.860
 Very good.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.860
 Yeah.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:37.860
 And just on process, Anna, if you are high on drugs or indeed drunk, they can't stop you

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.860
 from voting.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:39.860
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.380
 Even if you're the Queen.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.980
 And also if you're wearing a bucket on your head or something like that, they can't stop

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:47.980
 you from voting.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:48.980
 You don't have to show your face.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:49.980
 You're kidding.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:50.980
 No.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:51.980
 Oh, wow.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:52.980
 Well, otherwise you wouldn't be on to vote in a bucket.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:53.980
 Yeah.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:54.980
 I guess not.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.820
 And we'd find out who Lord Buckethead is when he goes to vote.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.980
 There was a party that lost all of their deposits.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:21:59.980
 Okay.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:05.140
 And they lost, between 1992 and 2001, they contested 500 seats in that time, they lost every

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.140
 single deposit.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.140
 You probably remember them.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.140
 The natural law party.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.140
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.140
 I remember that.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.140
 Well, they're the levitating ones.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.140
 They, yes.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.140
 They worked.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.980
 They were ones who thought they could never take.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:16.980
 They believed.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.020
 So a lot of listeners might remember them, a lot of listeners might not.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.020
 They believed you could do this thing called yogic flying, which is basically bouncing

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:27.340
 around with your legs crossed on your bottom with big hot water bottles underneath you.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.340
 Oh, wow.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:35.820
 But they believed that the first policy, right, if they had won in 1997 was that they would

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:41.980
 make a special air service from the armed forces of 7,000 yogic flyers to hover in and fix

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.300
 everything in the country.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.300
 Wow.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.300
 I remember.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.500
 I'm sure you told me, Sandy, that the trick to yogic flying has three steps.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.500
 Oh, this is mine that I remember.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:51.500
 What was it?

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.500
 One of the series.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.500
 You can say it then.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.500
 What was it?

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.500
 Because I can't remember.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.500
 Oh, it was just the yogic flying.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.500
 The way you get there is a three stage process.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:03.740
 So I think stage one is standing on one foot and stage two is being able to hop on one foot

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.900
 and stage three is full levitation.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:10.580
 And I remember a proud statement by the yogic flying institute saying we have successfully

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:15.540
 completed two of the three crucial steps.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:24.820
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:30.500
 Okay, my fact this week is that Kenya have an election later this year and they're running

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:36.260
 out of symbols for their candidates, which means that candidates are now using symbols

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:42.220
 such as a milk packet, a termite and a robot.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.220
 Okay.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.260
 Look at Samford's round with the robots as their main thing, this time round, didn't they?

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.260
 Yeah.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.260
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.260
 That was a good piece of satire.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.260
 No, that was the joke about Theresa.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.260
 Oh, it doesn't mess up.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.260
 Guys, you two are tired, aren't you?

00:23:54.260 --> 00:24:00.700
 That was a very strong joke and stable.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:05.700
 So yeah, this actually happens in quite a lot of places in the world and it's how important

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.220
 it is to have a symbol next to your name.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:12.500
 So we know in Britain we have symbols for the Conservatives and Labour like the Rose and

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.740
 the torch and in America they would have the elephants and the donkey and whatever they

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.260
 have over there.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.620
 But in lots of places in the world you have a lot of low literacy and so if you can't read

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:27.780
 the name of your preferred candidate you need to have the symbol and so they need a symbol

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.100
 which is really memorable and striking.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.260
 They thought a termite would be there.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.820
 People want to vote for that.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.820
 I might.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.820
 I would.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:36.820
 What do you think about that?

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.660
 It's very industrious and they're hardworking and they get the job done and they think that's

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.660
 the idea.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.100
 They club together and they achieve things.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.100
 Yeah.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:48.860
 Was the milk carton half full or half empty or was it a full of milk?

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.580
 That's how you look at it and that's what kind of person you want.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.380
 No it was just you couldn't look inside the milk carton because it was just a depiction

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:02.700
 of one and actually this happens like I said quite a lot around the world in India.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:08.860
 The election commission a lot symbols to you and so there's a big long list of 164 available

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:13.420
 symbols and you provide them three of them that you would like and then they choose one

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.020
 of the three if it's available.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.020
 Yeah.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.020
 So cool.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:21.220
 They're all ones don't they like they have I was really not what was saying I think they've

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:25.860
 modernised their symbols lately because they've recently added a sewing machine so I don't

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.740
 know how modern they've got but they have scissors as one of the symbols you can choose a

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.740
 stethoscope.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.380
 Do they have rock and paper?

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:38.900
 It's a three way marginal.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.700
 An ice cream going for the youth vote.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.700
 Yeah.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.700
 Yeah.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:43.700
 They have.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.700
 They do it in Egypt as well.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.700
 I saw the actual symbols.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:51.580
 The picture here they use everything from a tractor to a ballistic missile to a tap

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:57.500
 to this is my favourite one a mobile phone but the mobile phone symbol has a picture in

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.620
 the mobile phone like a background and I'm pretty sure it's the politician who was running

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:06.660
 but you know the thing with Egypt is it's not just that you choose three and they choose

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.740
 for you it's actually completely random that they choose the symbol for you.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:15.620
 So you say I'm going to run in Egypt and they just randomly pick you a symbol.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.700
 So you'll have some politicians who think they're really kind of serious and you'll see

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.580
 their poster and then it's got all of their picture and all of their stuff on there and

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.860
 then there's like a picture of a banana next to it.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.380
 It's just ridiculous.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.820
 And like for instance it can be quite bad because there was a female MP who had a rocket

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:41.860
 as her symbol just allocated randomly but rocket means hotty in Egyptian slang apparently.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.540
 So she was like well I can't do this I'm a serious MP you can't call me a hotty but

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.540
 that wasn't random.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:52.260
 I bet it was an all-male panel that randomly selected those symbols at some point.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.820
 It's one of the symbols of penis.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:59.460
 No, I think bananas as close as you get.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.700
 One of the ones I'm looking at here is a cannon camera.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.500
 Like it's actually got the cannon logo on it.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.500
 That's cool.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:10.740
 Well I look through the canyon list and they're really random so there's an electrical

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.980
 socket, there's some broken handcuffs, there's a steering wheel.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.740
 Broken handcuffs does not say to me tough on crime.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.260
 That says major cuts in crime.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:27.020
 So the canyon election is between Ahoru and NASA.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.020
 NASA?

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.020
 What the American Space Agency?

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.580
 No, the National Super Alliance party.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:37.580
 So it's President Ahoru Kenyatta and everyone else is kind of gang together with a coalition

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.860
 to go against him and they called themselves a National Super Alliance party known as

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.980
 the abbreviation NASA and they're hoping that their coalition will unseat him.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.700
 I think the election is in August.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.980
 I'm glad I don't have any places unstable as Kenya where there's one party which has got

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.620
 just about half the seats and one which is definitely trying to club together.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:59.300
 This is going to go out of date so quickly, I don't know if I'm going to say it.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.140
 We're going to date before tonight, will it?

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.140
 Might do actually.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.140
 You know, no.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.140
 Yeah.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.140
 So just you mentioned brands in logos.

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.140
 Yeah.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:12.380
 There are some places where companies get a vote so I was looking at how Hong Kong elections

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.380
 work actually.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.380
 You might know this.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:21.200
 So the way Hong Kong constituencies are divided up is that five of their seats are geographical

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:27.820
 seats and then all the rest are and then all the rest are like for companies and so they

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:33.340
 get like an industry seat and they get an agricultural seat and they get a tourism seat

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:37.300
 and it's really weird because that means that people like Canada air get a vote in the Hong

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.300
 Kong elections.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.300
 Wow.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.300
 That is insane.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.300
 Yeah, they do.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.900
 So all these airlines from all around the world get votes in the Hong Kong elections.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.140
 Does a company vote equal the same as a single person's vote?

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.140
 I think it does.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.140
 Yeah.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.140
 Or it might be more in fact.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.140
 Wow.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.140
 Yeah.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.140
 It's really weird.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.140
 That's amazing.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.180
 I'm going to just sit as MPs.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.420
 Because corporations by law are individuals, aren't they?

00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:59.420
 Right.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.020
 I mean, that's just a technical legal thing, but I think they are.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.020
 Yeah.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.020
 They'll be able to vote in this country.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:06.780
 But they're not standing up for themselves.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.020
 They used to have, I think we've said this before, that universities used to get a vote.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.020
 Did they?

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.820
 So as well as the city of Oxford having an MP or maybe it was two MPs, actually at the time

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:20.060
 it was each constituency had two MPs, Oxford and Cambridge each got to send an MP or two

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.060
 to the House of Commons.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.060
 It is.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.060
 And that meant that students used to get two votes.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:28.900
 So it was until 1950, I think, 1948 and so it was Oxford got MP, Cambridge on MP, all

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.940
 the London ones got an MP and then just all the other Unies got an MP.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.860
 And then yeah, it sounds like university challenges.

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.380
 It morphed into that.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.100
 Wow, that's amazing.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:44.740
 And then students didn't vote again until last night.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.700
 So did you hear the thing recently about Donald Trump's logo, speaking of logos?

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.340
 No, it's his logo.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:55.220
 It's a crest and it has the word Trump on it, but it turns out that he just nicked it from

00:29:55.220 --> 00:30:00.540
 somebody else and it was an old English crest and he took off the word integrity and put

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.660
 him on the word Trump, which is the most amazing metaphor.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:05.900
 So funny.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:14.460
 Yeah, it was the husband of the woman who built Mar-a-Lago, got given this crest in 1939.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.300
 Mar-a-Lago, his, you know, his second wife, his golf club.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.980
 And the Trump organisation just took that coat of arms, changed the word, never asked permission

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:21.980
 from anyone.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:27.660
 And then when he came back to the UK to open his horrible golf course, he, um, I'm sure it's

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.980
 a very nice golf course if anyone wants to give me free land of golf.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:37.620
 Sorry, when the, when his fantastic golf course opened, um, he got in trouble because he hadn't

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:42.700
 registered the emblem according to the 1672 Lion King of Arms Act in Scotland.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.260
 And then he tried to trademark and they said, no, that's already a thing here.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.260
 You can't do that.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.260
 Wow.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.260
 So he had to invent a new crest solely to use in his Scottish golf courses, but in America

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.060
 he's still using the one he's nicked.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.860
 I think a lot of it is Americans listening to this would probably be quite amused by

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.860
 how uptight we are about our crests, I should think.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.860
 Yes.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.620
 Well, the New York Times wrote in its cover, as they said, the British are known for taking

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:07.900
 Haraldry very seriously.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:17.420
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:21.900
 My fact is that in the 19th century, one of England's constituencies had no people living

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:27.780
 in it and another one was underwater.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.780
 Wow.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.180
 These are so, they're called rotten burrows, which are constituencies where there used to

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.560
 be a load of people living there and it made sense for them to have two MPs and then over

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:41.540
 time the population changes or the place goes derelict, but the rules haven't been updated

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.180
 so they still get MPs.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.900
 And then it's really easy for someone, normally the landowner who owns the land, to just

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:52.020
 take over the place, pick his own MPs and send them to the elsewhere.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.020
 That's amazing.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:56.060
 Yeah, there's a black-adder episode, which is all about this, basically.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.060
 Really?

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.180
 And one of the constituencies that was underwater, Dunnich, is the inspiration for the thing

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.460
 in the episode, which is called Dunnie on the World.

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.460
 Oh, really?

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:04.460
 Yes.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.660
 Do you know that Dunnich was the capital of the Kingdom of the East Angles?

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.660
 What is it?

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:13.940
 Yeah, well, so it used to be a really important place and it was a port similar in size to

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:18.700
 the 14th century London, according to Wikipedia, so it was a massive, massive place and that's

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.700
 why they had this boat.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:20.700
 Yeah.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:26.580
 It's supposedly, yeah, exactly, rivaled the capital, and it's called Daniel like this, the

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.060
 British Atlantis.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.060
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:30.060
 What do you mean?

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.060
 It is called that.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.820
 I'm calling it that now.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.820
 Who calls it that?

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:34.820
 This guy.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.820
 But Atlantis isn't the thing about Atlantis that we don't know where it is.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:38.820
 We know where Dunnich is.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.820
 It just doesn't.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:40.820
 It's just not there anymore.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:41.820
 It fell into the sea.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:47.500
 I forgot it fell into the sea, I thought it was just a place we couldn't find.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.500
 Yeah.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.500
 No, it fell into the sea.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.500
 Yeah, and it's the British Atlantis.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.300
 It's not claiming to be the Atlantis.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.300
 Yeah.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.300
 Anyway, guys.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.300
 Yeah.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.300
 I got that.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.300
 But you got that.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.300
 It's still there, okay, and it's underwater.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:03.100
 And supposedly at midnight or at night, you can hear church bells dangling around in the

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.100
 water.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:08.100
 And that's just someone voting with their penis.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.500
 And it had eight churches, it had two hospitals, and there's one man.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.820
 This was a piece in the India about ten years ago.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:18.860
 He's called Stuart Bacon, and he's done about a thousand dives down there, and he has a map

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:22.860
 which was printed five hundred years ago, and he can make his way around by touch.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.860
 Wow.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:24.860
 The city underwater.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:25.860
 That is extremely cool.

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:26.860
 It's so cool.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:27.860
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:28.860
 So what's left of it?

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:29.860
 Is there like building?

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.700
 There was almost nothing left.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.100
 Most of it was swept away in the two stores.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.500
 There's like a church, a few houses, a pret.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:40.620
 Socky sandwiches.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:44.060
 So it did that actually had about two hundred people living there, which is much larger than

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.540
 a load of other constituencies.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:49.060
 And before they were reformed, there were fifty seats in the country which each had fewer

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.700
 than fifty voters living in them.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.700
 So funny.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:56.340
 And it was the 1832 reform act, a bit of process for you to remember.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:00.020
 And it was that act which got rid of these burrows, but it was also the act that excluded

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:05.300
 women from voting, because until then it wasn't explicitly against the rules for women

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.300
 to vote.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.300
 If they were landowners, they couldn't theory.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.300
 One did actually.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:14.860
 I think the first woman to vote was in the late 1500s because she was a widow of a big landowner

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.580
 who'd been the person who would nominate the person to go to Parliament, so she got

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.580
 to nominate.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.740
 So, women got the vote in the 16th century.

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:24.540
 But did you know that Charles James Fox, who's a famous British Prime Minister, when he

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.060
 became leader, he was too young to vote.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:31.020
 So he was 19 when he became leader in 1768 and the voting age was 21.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.380
 How does that work then?

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:38.940
 I guess just other people voted for, and his father bought the constituency for him.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:39.940
 There we go.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.260
 It was shit and epitaph.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.260
 Wow.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.860
 So Aaron from the Green Party doing his A level history exam, back then might not have been

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.860
 able to vote either.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.860
 Yeah.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:48.860
 What do you think?

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.860
 18 would have been too young.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.860
 Yeah.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:51.860
 Wow.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:56.340
 So, one of the features of rotten burrows, which were a massive problem, obviously, in the

00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:00.780
 country, was this thing called pot walloping.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.940
 I had never heard of this.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:03.940
 It's so cool.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:10.340
 So, before the reform act, then you could vote in certain areas if you were a pot wallapper.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.340
 And what it meant was, is that you had a pot or a cauldron.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:19.060
 And if you had a pot that was big enough, if you had a pot, a proper big cooking pot, it

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:22.380
 showed that you had a hearth that was big enough to put the pot in.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.300
 And if you had a hearth that was big enough to put the pot in, then you obviously had

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:29.500
 the freehold of a house and therefore you were considered responsible enough to vote.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.980
 So, could you not just get a knockoff pot off either?

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.980
 Yeah.

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:33.980
 You would have thought so.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:34.980
 Yeah.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.980
 Did you have to bring a pot with you to the voting boat?

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.860
 That's why nobody voted, because people were dragging these enormous heavy cauldrons around

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.860
 the streets.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:44.180
 They actually had one guy called Lord Culdron Head.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:51.500
 Isn't it the case that they had to, if you were voting, it was done in public, one by

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.500
 one.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.500
 Yes.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.500
 It's done in public.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.500
 And it took ages.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.500
 Right.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.420
 But did you have to declare it sort of to everyone or was it a secret ballot?

00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.420
 No, no, you did.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.580
 The ballot wasn't introduced until the 1870.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.580
 Wow.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.540
 That meant that you could obviously, people could sort of bribe you.

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:06.540
 Yeah.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.780
 It was called treating your constituents, you get them free food and drink basically.

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:10.780
 Yeah.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.300
 And sometimes that would cost so much money that only one person could afford to stand

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:14.780
 in the seat anyway.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.780
 Hmm.

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:18.540
 People used to sign their ballot papers, actually, because that was a good, because the

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.980
 person who had been elected would go through the ballot papers afterwards and look at

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:24.100
 who voted for them and be like, "Oh, Johnny, I'll give him a little present."

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.260
 Mr. penis is voted for him.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:34.420
 And if you were super rich, presumably you could gift people pots to allow them to vote for

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.420
 you.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:36.420
 To give them the franchise.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.420
 Yeah.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.420
 To gain votes.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.420
 Yeah.

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.420
 Okay, get this.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:41.420
 The 1784 election.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:46.420
 Voting opened in the Westminster constituency on the 1st of April and it closed on the 17th

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.420
 of May.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.420
 What?

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.420
 What?

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.780
 Took nearly two months just to gather the votes, because they didn't have this thing, because

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.260
 obviously they didn't have mass communication and they didn't need to do the election all

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.700
 on the same day, basically.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:01.660
 But Sondland still turned in all their votes by 10 p.m. that day.

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.060
 Sondland's like the swatty kid in the class, isn't it?

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:05.060
 Hey, not this year, though.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.060
 I know, they got this.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.060
 They got this.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.100
 Oh, so quickly explain that for overseas people, Sondland usually.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:15.620
 So the polls close at 10 o'clock, and Sondland for the last 20 years has always been the first

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:19.780
 constituency to give their result, and they usually do it by about 11 or something like

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.780
 that.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.780
 They're really, really quick.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:22.780
 They're really, really quick.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:23.780
 But this was the first year in ages.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.620
 In my lifetime, I think that Newcastle has beaten them.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:26.620
 Yeah.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:30.420
 And as a Newcastle fan, I was thrilled with the result of that derby between them.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:34.540
 It's been a bad year for Sondland all together, isn't it, because they got relegated from the

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.100
 Premier League and now this.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.300
 And Newcastle got promoted from the championships.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.100
 So in your face, Sondland.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.100
 Wow.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.180
 We're not doing a tall day in Sondland, are we?

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:48.180
 Not anymore.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.180
 Should we wrap up?

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.180
 Sure.

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.180
 Yeah, let's go to bed.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.180
 Yeah.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.180
 Oh, wait.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.180
 Can I tell you?

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.180
 Oh, no.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.620
 I'm just a bit more processed to finish off.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.460
 This is, I was just really surprised about this.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:06.700
 Supermarkets, people who shop in certain supermarkets vote for certain people.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:11.620
 And where would you guess, Aldi and Little, how their loyalty is these days?

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:15.060
 They're budget shops, so I would imagine it's people on a tighter budget, so I'd say Labour.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.060
 Yeah.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.060
 What a thought, so wouldn't you?

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.060
 It's the Tories.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.060
 There's Tories voters.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:21.060
 So actually, the Tories have all supermarkets shoppers.

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:23.260
 I don't know where Labour voters are shopping.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:28.220
 Tories shop in Tesco's, Waitrose, St. Breeze, Aldi and Little are now all conservative.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.540
 And it's just Morrison's and Astor that they've got the Labour vote.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:35.380
 But you do hear about Little Britain, don't you?

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:39.300
 Ah, true Labour voters grow all their own produce on their allotments.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:46.620
 Okay, that's it.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.220
 That's all we can do.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.820
 We need to go to sleep now.

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.820
 We are knackered.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.140
 I need to close my working eye.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.900
 And we will be back again next week with another episode.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.380
 Until then, you can reach us and chat more to us about the British elections if you want

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.380
 on our Twitter accounts.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:10.340
 I'm on @Streiberland, James, @SkipLicca, @EggShate, Andy, Andrew Hunter M, and Shazinski.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.180
 You can email podcast@QI.com.

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.180
 Yep.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.020
 And you can also go to our group account @QIPodcast.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.020
 You can go to our website.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.940
 No such thing as a fish.com where you can find all of our previous episodes.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:26.180
 There's also our tour dates for the UK, and there's also a link to our book which is coming

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.220
 out in November.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.420
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.420
 We'll see you then.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:31.940
 Goodbye.
