 [phone rings]

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.280
 [speaking Japanese]

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:11.040
 [music]

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.240
 - Hi.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.520
 How was that?

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.320
 - Lovely.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.880
 - James?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.360
 - Oh yeah, I'm in 7 out of 10.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.480
 - Okay, well.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.000
 - But you got a factor at the time.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.200
 It's 8.30 in the morning.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.400
 That was powerhouse.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.600
 That was stadium level.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.560
 - Welcome, everybody, to a morning-recorded edition

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.000
 of Drop as a Line.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.640
 Will it be much different to our standard early afternoon record?

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.080
 Let's find out.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.000
 As we go through your inboxes, no we don't.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.360
 We go through your outboxes.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.200
 - We don't know we don't.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.240
 - This is so slick.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.480
 - As we go through our inboxes,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.800
 covering the messages that have come from your outboxes.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.600
 - Should we come back in maybe about three or four hours?

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.320
 - So, look, let's just get in.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.080
 We've got some "um" actuallys.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.400
 We've got some "get yourself off the hooks."

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.720
 Maybe there's some spicy meat lurking in here.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.640
 Let's find out.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 Message one comes.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.520
 This is a bit of an...

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.160
 It's an "um" actually, but it's a nice one.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.040
 This is from Daniel Wilson, who said a few episodes ago,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.000
 "We mentioned some facts about the International Owl Center

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.120
 in Houston."

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.600
 - "Hoo-hoo-ston."

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.480
 - "Hoo-ston?"

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.800
 - Brilliant.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.560
 - "It's Houston, right?"

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.560
 "But it's Houston, M-N."

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.000
 What's that? Minnesota?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.960
 - Minnesota, yeah, that's right.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.720
 - Minnesota.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.160
 Daniel, there was a point to Daniel's message.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
 He wasn't just congratulating us on mentioning

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.960
 the International Owl Center.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.360
 He said, "Houston is a small town in M-N,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.680
 as we now know, Minnesota.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.240
 And the Owl Center is an outgrowth of the relationship

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.840
 between the founder, Carla Bloom,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.000
 and Alice the Great Horned Owl."

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.680
 - Okay, that's nice.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.320
 - I assume it's nice.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.680
 Relationships can be nice, can not be.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.640
 Might be antagonistic.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.440
 Daniel continues, "Since the International Owl Center

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.160
 is not technically a zoo, and since owls cannot be kept

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.880
 as pets, all the owls at the International Owl Center

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.160
 are designated as employees.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.240
 They have four owl employees and three humans.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.240
 Due to old Asian arthritis, Alice,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.920
 that's Alice the Great Horned Owl,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.920
 officially retired in 2018.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.880
 I went to her retirement party, which was great fun.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.880
 She didn't attend physically the retirement party,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.600
 but she did attend virtually from her retirement home."

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.640
 - That's really nice.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.440
 I guess if you were an owl employee,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.640
 then you would once have the night shift,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.280
 and it'd be like, "Oh my god, I'm on day shift today."

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.120
 - Oh, night there, yeah.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.560
 That's really funny.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.600
 - What's the law behind that?

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.120
 It's different to a zoo, I guess, right?

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.160
 The zoo animals are different.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.560
 - Not technically a zoo, I suppose, yeah.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.520
 - Yeah.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.440
 - 'Cause it would be a good idea at a zoo if all the animals

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.320
 at a zoo were employees, you would save on staffing,

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.080
 and you would have some more fun, you know, fun adventures.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.960
 - Leaving do's.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.200
 (laughing)

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.640
 - Oh no, the penguins have got together with a fish, no.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.280
 Yeah, anyway, thank you, Daniel.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.880
 That was lovely bonus info.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.840
 - Yeah, brilliant.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.280
 - Well, let's move on to an email from jamrainbird,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.720
 which is about--

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.920
 - Sorry, who?

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.440
 - Jamrainbird?

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.080
 - Brilliant.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.440
 That's not a real name, is it?

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.080
 - I think so, yeah.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.120
 - Who is it?

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.480
 Jam, first name.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.360
 Rainbird, surname.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.200
 That's not someone who's having their breakfast

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.600
 in the conservatory and just pick three random things

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.480
 to give them a name.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.240
 (laughing)

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.000
 - That's an employee from the birds, actually.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.960
 (laughing)

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.760
 Well, Jam writes, "James confirmed my understanding somewhat

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.920
 when he said that tortoises have toes."

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.400
 Do you remember this?

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.600
 We were talking about tortoises having--

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.360
 - Yeah, so the idea is that sometimes people put tortoises

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.720
 in the water to save them, thinking that they're turtles,

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.520
 and so the best way to tell is that tortoises have toes.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.720
 - Yeah, exactly that.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.600
 And Jam says, "Tortoise equals land turtle.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.960
 Water turtle doesn't need toes.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.680
 Makes sense to me.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.560
 Tortoises have toes."

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.360
 Great.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.720
 Dan then repeated, "Total, total 101 times."

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.400
 (laughing)

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.280
 - Okay, that was Dan's joke, wasn't it?

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.480
 - Roughly, yeah.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.680
 I think it's a proposed mnemonic.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.040
 Maybe you said it one or two times, Dan,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.240
 but it felt like a lot.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.000
 Unfortunately, total sounds more like turtle than tortoise,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.040
 so Dan's mnemonic makes me think that it is turtles

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.520
 that have toes and tortoises that don't,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.400
 which is the opposite.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.880
 (laughing)

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.480
 - Oh, no, Dan.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.920
 - Yeah, I got a lot of kickback from that attempt

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.520
 of a new name.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.800
 Everyone's saying it should actually

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.520
 be turtles the other way around.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.880
 I was putting it on the wrong side.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.400
 - No.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.920
 - Neither work, Andy, neither work.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.760
 (laughing)

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.520
 - And then, worryingly, Jam says,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.520
 "Even more, unfortunately, I just googled tortoises

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.440
 and turtles and discovered that both tortoises

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.920
 and other turtles have toes."

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.480
 Query needed.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.080
 Tortoises certainly have more toes.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.280
 - Yeah.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.880
 - They'll have the same skeletal structure

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.600
 because they're all--

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.800
 - I would say so.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.800
 - Because we're all the same, deep down.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.920
 - I read this from a conservationist

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.720
 who was saying that people are doing this

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.680
 and that it's a problem.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.440
 And this was their kind of rule of thumb,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.160
 but perhaps it's a rule of toes

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.240
 that doesn't quite always work.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.280
 - I think it's a pretty good--

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.880
 You can definitely tell more toes on a tortoise than a--

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.360
 - For sure.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.840
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.440
 I think it works.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.520
 And if you're at the water's edge now,

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.240
 just drop it in.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.120
 It'll probably be fine.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.440
 - No, I think what we're saying, actually,

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.280
 is just leave it to the experts.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.800
 Like, whether it's a turtle, a tortoise, a terrapin,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.840
 or any other animal beginner with tea, just leave it.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.400
 Let it be--

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.800
 - Tiger.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.400
 - It's a tiger.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.200
 Rub it by the toe.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.800
 - Don't return it to the water.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.160
 Don't take it.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.000
 Oh, here's the most annoying email in the inbox.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.120
 This was, do you remember Dan guessing the day of the week

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.600
 when I said, you know, people can get it.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.600
 People, there's math sevens who can get it right.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.440
 I said 24 February 1603.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.960
 Dan, do you remember what you guessed?

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.520
 - Monday.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.920
 - Yeah.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.120
 Well, Heather Morgan writes,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.360
 "I'm sure many people have told you this already,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.520
 but A, 24 February 1603 was the day Catherine Howard died."

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.120
 Interesting.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.000
 - Oh.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.440
 - Yeah, on a Monday.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.280
 - And yeah, B, it was a Monday.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.760
 You're right.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.560
 By sheer chance.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.840
 It's so annoying.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.680
 - Well, someone pointed out that actually,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.040
 I'm probably wrong because the calendars have changed,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.520
 haven't they?

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.760
 - Oh, yes, they have.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.640
 - Yeah.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.320
 So I think, I can't remember.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.680
 I briefly saw the message.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.280
 It might have been a Wednesday or something like that.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.520
 - So the calendar, there was a point where the calendar

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.440
 switched over from Gregorian to Julian

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.400
 or the other way around.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.080
 - I think this might have taken it into account

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.520
 because you don't remember at school.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.840
 It's like, "Divorced beheaded died,

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.840
 divorced, beheaded on a Monday.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.400
 Survived."

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.080
 - So good.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:05.280
 We've got a slightly mystical email from Nathan Galamore Strong.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.080
 - Oh.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.400
 - Nathan.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.360
 - What a Galamore.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.080
 - Galamore name.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.840
 - Right, let me preface this by saying,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.600
 I have no idea why I'm telling you this.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.080
 Exciting.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.200
 I often listen to the podcast just before bed,

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.880
 and this was sometimes results in some of my dreams

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.120
 containing some aspects of the facts or discussions

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.240
 during that particular episode.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.960
 - Right.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.680
 - Trippy.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.640
 Last night, I had a dream that I was in a pub,

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.840
 and none other than James Harkin came in.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.480
 I freaked out with excitement,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.240
 mentioning to my wife about who it was

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.440
 and if I should go and say hi.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.440
 - Yep, do say hi if I ever walk in a pub.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.480
 - Well, Nathan goes on.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.400
 I built up the courage to walk over and explain

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.520
 that I'm a huge fan.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.040
 James then gave me the most disdainful look.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:56.640
 And when I asked for a photo, he begrudgingly agreed

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.200
 and posed with the most sour look on his face

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.200
 before telling me to leave him alone.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.040
 - Oh, wow.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.040
 - I woke up in a state of utter shock.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.400
 That's, yeah, well, that's what I like.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.120
 - Checks out.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.160
 - Only in dreams.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.720
 Like, in real life, I'm actually quite nice

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.840
 if you ask me for a photo,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.960
 but if you do it in a dream, I will be absolutely livid.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.920
 - That's exactly right.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.640
 That's the way around.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.080
 James lives in the other realm where he's grumpy.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.960
 Yeah, he says, "I now have an irrational fear

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.320
 "that if I ever meet James in real life,

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.840
 "this dream will become a reality."

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.480
 Could you ask James if this is a weird premonition,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.920
 or if he is, as I suspect,

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.040
 actually a pleasant human being?

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.160
 Well, he is.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.920
 I cannot rest, Nathan says.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.680
 - I'd love to know one day,

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.520
 because there is a possibility that one day,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.200
 James, you're having a really terrible day.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.400
 You're walking to a pub.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.520
 You just don't need it.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.200
 This guy's like, "What a dream."

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.080
 You're like, "Jesus."

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.280
 Like, you know, that's good deal.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.640
 - I'm fucking out of that to leave the game.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.360
 - Well, he's even better.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.600
 Well, he's got Nathan, something strong.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.800
 - Gallimaw strong.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.160
 - Nathan Gallimaw strong.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.560
 - Yeah.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.240
 It's quite a sci-fi name, isn't it?

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.360
 - Yeah, you're pissed off already.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.240
 You walked into a pub.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.720
 A bag comes up saying, "I am Nathan Gallimaw strong."

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.560
 - In that tone of voice.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.280
 - Yep.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.880
 - Just let me get to the fucking bar.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.200
 - Yeah.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.480
 I'm so excited for this meeting.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:10.800
 - I know.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.800
 He says, "It's worth pointing out,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.720
 I love," I assume he means live,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.760
 "nowhere near London,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.720
 and likely will never run into any of Team Fish,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.400
 but this is haunting me."

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.280
 - Oh, we travel.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:21.760
 - Wow.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.480
 - We travel around.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.120
 - We do.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.480
 - Dancing Liverpool right now

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.520
 when we're recording this.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:25.760
 - Oh, yeah.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.240
 - Exactly.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.360
 And I'll be in York.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.720
 Well, this is, Windsor's going out.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.400
 - You will have been in York.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.240
 - Yeah, and Leeds.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:32.880
 - Yeah.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.040
 - But you will no longer be in those places.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.600
 - Exactly.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.760
 - So, like, search your recent memory

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.240
 if you live in Liverpool, York, or Leeds

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.160
 for having maybe seen him and thought,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.480
 "Is that?"

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.200
 No, maybe it wasn't.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:43.600
 I don't know.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.000
 - Check all your photos and see if there's

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.320
 a strange, bespectacled man in the background

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:48.960
 of any of them.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.360
 - Hairy, really hairy.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.120
 Look for the hair and the glasses together.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.880
 - Was that sort of bigfoot?

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.320
 Yeah, walking around.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.800
 Is anyone, I'm just curious, in the inbox,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.520
 going to defeat either Nathan Gallimaw strong

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.840
 or jam Rain Bird as a name?

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.840
 - No, I don't think so.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.480
 I've got, well, yeah, up to you, really.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.120
 - I'm very excited to see what's coming.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.920
 - All right.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.360
 We've got a few first names, which are,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.960
 you know, they're less rounded.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:22.240
 But, so, for example, Courtney, Courtney writes,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.360
 "Over the years I have nearly written in a number of times.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.040
 However, today I had to.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.760
 Please tell Neil Gaiman that our families still say "bygals"

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.160
 as his mother does, rather than bagels.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.600
 We're from Whitechapel, East London,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.120
 and all the locals still do.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.960
 However, when I talk to anyone outside the postcode,

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.400
 I have to say it like the Americans do.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.760
 So there is still a bygle movement.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.640
 - How interesting.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:46.960
 - Yeah.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.160
 - And Whitechapel is down the road.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.480
 - Yeah.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.200
 And we got another, we got a second email on this saying,

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.320
 you're saying it wrong.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.920
 I nearly had to stop listening to the episode.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.680
 It's bygles, bygles, bygles, bygles.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.480
 Don't ever get it wrong again.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.520
 - Wow, I didn't realize there was such a...

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.760
 I mean, I know Neil said that there was a problem with him,

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.680
 and not a problem with him and his mother.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.840
 Just a discussion with him and his mother.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.160
 They're not now estranged over the pronunciation of bygle.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.040
 But I didn't realize it was such a hot topic.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.240
 - It's a hot potato.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.160
 - I don't think I've ever heard anyone say it.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.960
 - Hot potato, I think.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.760
 - Very nice.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.760
 - Can't let them, what were you saying?

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.320
 - No, I just, I don't think, you know, even in East London,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.480
 I've ever heard someone say by...

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.880
 You know, used to go all the time to the bagel shops,

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.760
 which are on Brick Lane,

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.600
 which are very famous late night horns

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.520
 for when you're kicked out of pubs.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.880
 - Close to Whitechapel, I would say.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.280
 - Exactly.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.320
 - But they don't have a...

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.680
 They might be bygles shops then,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.360
 as in they don't have a pronunciation guide

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.160
 on the front of the shop.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.200
 - But I just never heard anyone in the vicinity going,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.080
 let's get a bygle.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.160
 You know, you know, listening out loud on the streets,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.680
 as I do, as you know, Andy.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.000
 - All right, so bagels bygles sorted.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.040
 We have had a great email from Noah Levine,

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.040
 and this is a call forward to an episode

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.880
 that hasn't even been broadcast yet, I think.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.480
 - Wow.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:08.880
 - I know.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.400
 Adding to the list of weird sports I've discovered lately,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.400
 I just learned about walk racing.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.520
 - Okay.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.080
 - And it's where you ride down a huge,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.320
 I think an icy slope on a walk.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.040
 - On a walk?

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.760
 Yeah, nice.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.360
 - What's that referring to though?

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.040
 I don't remember us talking about weird spots.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.480
 - We didn't talk about walk racing,

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.040
 but the fact is this, Nathan Evans,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.320
 who recorded the chart-topping sea shanty Wellerman.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.240
 - Oh, gosh.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.880
 - Represented Scotland in the World Walk Racing Championship 2022.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.080
 - How did I not find that in my research?

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:42.800
 That's incredible.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.320
 - We've just recorded, but haven't yet put out

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.840
 an episode about sea shanties.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.960
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.480
 Won't go out for a few weeks, actually.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:48.960
 - Right.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.440
 - And this episode from 1999.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.160
 - We missed this.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.640
 - Can we quickly rebook the Soho?

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.160
 Just get in.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.000
 Do this extra bit.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.320
 - That's a great fact though, really.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:00.800
 - I know.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.440
 - Yeah, that's cool.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:07.600
 - Do we want to reopen the Wicca Satan box?

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.960
 - Okay.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.680
 - Yeah, I like that box.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.800
 - I think we've got a...

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.640
 I'm going to open the box from a different angle now.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.360
 - Okay.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.760
 - There's a second face in the box to be opened.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.200
 And it's interesting because Jamie Lerner Brecher writes,

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.960
 "Like everyone else who seems to write into this email address,

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.640
 long-time listener, first-time writer."

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.160
 Well, people, you know, once they've had a reply from me,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.280
 they don't feel the need to...

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.960
 A lot of them actually put me on a plot list immediately

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.840
 after getting my reply.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.520
 - You just replied back going, "Sorry, did you get my reply?"

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.840
 - I put read receipts on like the most irritating people

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.400
 on the planet.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.000
 "I'll need a receipt that you've seen this email, please."

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.240
 Right. "To correct a correction from the recent drop of the line,

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.480
 brackets, correct-ception, the Satanic Temple is definitely

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.400
 not just a libertarian organization.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.160
 I'm a leftist."

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.080
 That's Jamie writing, not me.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.720
 I obviously vote GB News.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.480
 It's a way for people who are either atheists

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.240
 or don't believe in organized religion

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.360
 to get the same protections in the USA offered to religious people.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.080
 So there was a recent ruling about reproductive justice

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.920
 and Jamie writes, "I joined the Satanic Temple

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.160
 because one of its main tenets is bodily autonomy

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.280
 and the right to an abortion.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.000
 As a non-practicing but culturally Jewish atheist,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.760
 this was an organized religion I could get behind."

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.480
 And they're trying to do other cool things.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.920
 And he goes on, "It's also extremely different

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.280
 than the Church of Satan or Wiccans.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.280
 And while you guys did say that, it was half a sentence

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.720
 and I'm sure left people confused."

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.800
 - Yeah, fair enough.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.600
 - They're trying to do other things.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.000
 They're trying to end corporal punishment in schools.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.880
 Sounds like a good idea.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.120
 And they're trying to get a Satanic prayer at the 50-yard line

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.360
 of a public high school football game

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.240
 since the Supreme Court recently ruled that legal for Christians.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.280
 I don't understand that.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.040
 - That's interesting.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.320
 Well, I do watch a lot of college football

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.440
 and American football.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.040
 And I assume he doesn't mean during the game.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.800
 - I don't.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.240
 - He's doing a prayer during the game.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.280
 It must be before the game

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.520
 when they do the National Anthems and stuff, I suppose.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.440
 - Could you do it during the game

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.560
 but at the edge of the line?

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.320
 As in where, you know, at the edge of the field,

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.120
 you could pray there.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:17.760
 - You could.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.840
 Usually you have, this is quite interesting.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.320
 So at the side of the field of American football,

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.240
 you have a load of referees there

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.000
 and they're looking out for anything going wrong.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.880
 It's not like in soccer where you have like three referee

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.720
 and two lines when you have loads of referees.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.120
 And you also have all of the substitutes,

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.400
 of which there's lots.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.240
 And you also have the managers, the coaches there.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.640
 Now the coaches are running up and down

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.800
 because they need to see everything that's happening.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.120
 And American football teams, a lot of them,

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.760
 employ one person whose job it is

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.720
 to pull the manager, the coach, out of the way

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.240
 if he's going to run into a referee.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.880
 So he doesn't have to look where he's running.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.560
 He can just run up and down the line.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.480
 And if he's about to hit a line judge,

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.720
 they just grab him and pull him out of the way.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.440
 - That's incredible.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.360
 - So they have to run with him, right?

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.200
 - Yeah, they run behind him the whole way.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.920
 And they're always watching that he doesn't bump into people.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.800
 - Oh, I see.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.720
 So they're kind of side-running,

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.800
 sideways running and hauling him out of the way

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.240
 because he's watching the game.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.880
 They're just looking at the pitch.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.480
 They're looking to his left and right

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.240
 to make sure that he doesn't run into anyone.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.440
 - That's incredible.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.520
 - It feels like with only a minimum more effort,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.240
 you could get a sedan chair for the coach.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.800
 And they'd be carried up and down the line.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.800
 - The thing is, it's a matter of,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.240
 if you have to employ two people to do that,

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.440
 you only have to employ one person to dodge him out of the way.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.200
 But sedan chair requires two people.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.800
 - It doesn't sound like a game is an efficient hiring.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.800
 If the sidelines are thronged with referees and lines,

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.440
 it sounds like there's a little fat here

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.520
 to add another employee.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.160
 - Yeah, I guess so.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.360
 - I think that's worth it.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.000
 - But James, has there ever been any sort of attempts

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.520
 of sabotage where the opposing team will place someone

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.440
 in the way and take the coach down

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.200
 so that he's sort of injured and you lose him for a while?

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:07.920
 - I see what you mean.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.200
 The thing is that your team are all on one side of the,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.800
 of the pitch and the other team own the other sidelines.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.520
 So you're kind of always on the opposite side to them.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.280
 - So you need a mole.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.080
 You need someone on the inside.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.640
 - Just a little mole, building your little mole, hell.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.240
 - That's such an amazing thing.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.560
 What's the career progression of that job?

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.520
 - I don't know actually.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.040
 - You move into bodyguarding, I think,

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.960
 because it's sort of dodging, like taking a bullet for someone.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.240
 It's just one or two steps up

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.800
 from stopping and bumping into an alignment.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.280
 - I guess so.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.080
 - So good.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.440
 What a great job.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.480
 That's amazing.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.840
 - I've just checked the prayer thing.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.440
 It turns out it's a high school football coach

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.480
 who wanted the right to pray on the 50 yard line after each game.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.040
 Any players who wanted to participate

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.440
 and they were said, they were told, yes, you can.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.240
 So that's fine.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.320
 So they're just asking for the right to do the...

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.960
 - I was in Waterstones last night

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.040
 and I was looking around in Liverpool

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.000
 and the wicker section is directly

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.440
 above the witchcraft section.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.480
 And I just wonder if that annoys them as well.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.120
 Just the proximity towards them.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.440
 - Yeah, but it's not above the Satan satanic sex

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.720
 in the woodlands section.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.320
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.680
 - Which most Waterstones do have.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.920
 - They do.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.840
 Liverpool was missing it for so long, but yeah.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.720
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.160
 - Okay, and now we're closing the box.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:34.000
 - Right.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.880
 - We now come onto the...

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.440
 This is the big...

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.280
 - Why are we not keeping it in a wicker basket?

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.080
 Why is it in a box?

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.240
 - Lack of imagination by me.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.040
 That's much...

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.680
 Oh, for next time.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.640
 Don't say next time.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.800
 Okay, well, look, I was thinking,

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.560
 by the way, as I was walking around today,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.120
 if we had a fish restaurant,

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.240
 we could call it in no particular order.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.080
 - Very good.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.080
 Although orders also are things that you do in restaurants.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.080
 - Yeah, it's really right there on the tin, isn't it?

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.200
 In no particular order.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.000
 - Yeah, it is.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.800
 - And what it is, is if someone walks in

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.320
 and they take their table,

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.640
 they might get their order taken straight away,

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.800
 or they might have to wait 45 minutes for their order.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.120
 - Oh, I thought it was more like,

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.840
 "Hey, why hasn't the main come before the starter?

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.360
 What's the dessert coming next?"

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:23.920
 - Oh, it's like...

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.680
 - And bring them out in no particular order.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.440
 - It's like, is it Wagamama?

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.400
 Or they always warn you?

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.360
 - Oh, yeah.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.800
 - Just in case you don't know,

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.480
 the food comes any order.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.680
 - Yeah.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.600
 - And it's...

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.160
 They're always...

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.360
 They're so worried that you're going to be annoyed about it.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.080
 - Well, yeah.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.800
 That's because they always bring the ice cream

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.920
 and then 20 minutes later,

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.600
 they bring the hot sauce, wings,

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.040
 or whatever it is that you've ordered.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.920
 It's like, "Oh, the ice cream was ready, sorry."

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:56.320
 - Just in case you've never been to a Wagamama.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.560
 - Anyway, look, we've come...

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.040
 - It is such a weird restaurant,

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:01.920
 when you point out that.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.840
 And then they just draw all over your place, man, buddy.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.240
 - Yeah, it's true, because I go to restaurants

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.280
 to deliberately ask for a place mat that I can color in.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.960
 I don't want someone else to do it for me.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:19.520
 - So that is a kind of long-winded way

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.960
 of getting around to me saying,

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.400
 "We're now reaching the main course."

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.600
 - Oh, great.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.320
 - Sorry, I just thought of hors d'oeuvres,

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.440
 and I thought, you know, that's where I was going with that.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.640
 But we had some fun along the way, yeah.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.480
 Right, in the Neil Gaiman episode,

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.680
 which went out a couple of weeks ago,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:42.560
 Dan brought up a guy who was pushing a peanut-upper

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:48.160
 mountain in Colorado with his nose called Pikes Peak.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.200
 That's the name of the mountain, not the men.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:56.320
 And I said, "Wow, what do people do in Colorado for fun?

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.480
 If you're in Colorado, can you write it and tell us?"

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.480
 There are so many fish listeners in Colorado,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.200
 and they've all been in the inbox in the last couple of weeks.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.080
 - Really?

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:06.800
 - Yeah.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.360
 - That's great.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.040
 So now, next time we go to Colorado,

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.680
 we have a full list of things that we can do for fun.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.880
 - It's genuinely double-figures,

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.560
 the number of people who've written in.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:14.960
 - Wow.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.360
 - Wow.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:15.760
 - Yeah.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.880
 - What's the most interesting thing?

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.120
 - Well, let's get into it.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.640
 Beckett writes...

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.280
 - Long parts.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.400
 - So, James...

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.920
 Main thing to do in Colorado is waiting for Godot.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.320
 Brilliant.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.160
 Hi, fish.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.680
 I've been listening to your podcast for years

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.520
 and never thought I'd hear a local story on it.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.120
 Not only did I already know about the man

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.440
 who pushed a peanut up Pikes Peak with his nose,

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.480
 but there were daily play-by-play updates about it at the time.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.960
 It was big news/nose.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.920
 The irony is that there is plenty to do in Colorado.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.600
 We are one of the most active states with a thriving outdoor culture

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.200
 that encourages skiing, hiking, biking, paddleboarding, you name it.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.360
 We also have several beautiful national parks

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.120
 and a world-renowned film festival.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.320
 That being said, we moved recently from Washington, D.C.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.440
 to the suburbs of Denver,

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.960
 and I find it mind-numbingly boring

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.000
 and commoditonous out here.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.200
 - You're sincerely pushing a peanut up a hell.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.360
 Beckett.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.400
 Beckett.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.440
 - I should say that's not a universal opinion

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.200
 by the people of Colorado who've written in.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.440
 A lot of them are very happy about the outdoor activities.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.600
 Yeah, it seems like a very outdoorsy place, basically.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:35.040
 - Yeah, I think I said, but maybe cut that it's a big skiing place, isn't it?

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.000
 - Oh, nice.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.280
 Tim writes, Tim lives in Colorado.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.840
 I can confirm that, one, there are things to do other than push peanuts up 14ers,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.240
 which is mountains over 14,000 feet.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.040
 And two, if there is a stupid thing that could be done outdoors,

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.800
 someone in Colorado will do it.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.960
 And there are 53 14ers in Colorado,

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.960
 and lots of people try and climb them all,

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.920
 but they also have Frozen Dead Guy Day.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.120
 - Oh, Dan's mentioned that before on the podcast.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.080
 - Oh, yeah.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.840
 - Do you remember that?

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.160
 - I don't remember it.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.400
 - It was, now, I might get it mixed up with an episode of The Simpsons,

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.200
 but there was a guy who got frozen and died.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.800
 - Well, I've got a little detail here.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.120
 - Okay, go on.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.400
 - There's a guy who frozen his shed,

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.840
 so you're exactly right, James,

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.400
 and there are things like a hearse parade and coffin races

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.800
 where a team has to run up and down hills of snow

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.400
 while carrying someone in a coffin.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:32.960
 - That's right.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.080
 - Wow.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.800
 Just a quick little quiz for us here,

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.760
 because I've just brought it up.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.360
 We get analytics of our listeners.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.920
 We, you know, it can tell us where people are listening from

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.240
 if we look into our data.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.000
 So I've just brought up America.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.600
 So for the last seven days,

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.720
 what do you think is the most, the number one city?

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.200
 - New York?

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.760
 - Number one, no, it's number two.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.000
 - Oh, is it Denver?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.800
 - Oh, dang.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.120
 - No, but Denver does appear on the list.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:01.600
 - Does it?

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.160
 - It's at six.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.480
 - I'm going to say Denver's at six.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.360
 - It's at six.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.160
 - Oh, sorry, it's at six.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.200
 - It's at six, yes.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.640
 - Because we've had 10 people write in,

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.920
 so that can't be right.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.760
 I'm going to say Houston, but not Houston, Texas.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.600
 Houston, Minnesota.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:21.680
 - Is it going to be LA, New Orleans, Chicago?

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.960
 - So directly below it is New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.600
 San Francisco comes further down, but yeah,

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.560
 it's slightly surprising.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.680
 - Boston, Seattle.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.720
 - Still a big city.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.600
 Seattle is right.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.280
 - Oh, well done, Andy.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.640
 - Yes, in the last seven days.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.080
 - I thought, what are we most like?

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:38.560
 - Frasier.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.560
 - Exactly.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.360
 - The new series.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.240
 - Day.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.240
 - Who would we all be in Frasier?

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.880
 Anna is Roz.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.080
 - Oh, yeah.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.480
 - Sarcastic, wine lover.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.840
 That fits.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.480
 - Well, Daphne's from Manchester, isn't she?

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.160
 - Do you want to be Daphne?

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:58.880
 - Yeah.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.400
 - Although Dan's got a weird accent.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.680
 - That's true.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.320
 - Yeah.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.680
 But I think I'm probably the dog.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.000
 - You're Eddie?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:06.320
 - Yeah.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.160
 - I think you're the chair.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:13.200
 Still there in the corner.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.160
 Good night, everyone.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:20.720
 - I think either of you could be Frasier, actually.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.160
 - What?

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.160
 - You obviously think of yourself as a Niles.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.360
 - Yeah.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.480
 - I mean, there's nothing.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.040
 Guys, good luck knocking me off the Niles perch,

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.120
 which I've been polishing every day for the last 10 years.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.800
 No one's going to step up and be the dad?

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.520
 - I don't really, I haven't really watched.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.320
 - You're the oldest.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:42.720
 - Yeah.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.360
 - All right.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.760
 - You used to be in the police.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.760
 You got shot in the hip actually during a robbery.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.720
 Actually, wow, that's weird.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.440
 You, yeah.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.680
 That's it.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.880
 - I like spots.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.000
 He likes spots, doesn't he?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.880
 - You like sports.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.840
 You'll probably, you know the most about beer.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.720
 You like beer.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.440
 He likes beer.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.280
 I think there's a case there.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.200
 - I think you like sitting on me?

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:11.920
 - Well, we've got it worked out.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.040
 Great.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.160
 - Nice.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:14.480
 - Okay.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.720
 What are we talking about?

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.360
 - Seattle.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.960
 - Oh, we were talking about a dead man.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.680
 Was it Seattle?

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.080
 - Yeah.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.680
 - I just brought that up because of Colorado.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.640
 We've got a lot of listeners.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:22.880
 - Great.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.920
 - Double digits in the inbox.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.720
 - Oh, double digits.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.840
 Yeah, yeah, you're right.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.320
 Okay, great.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.360
 Well, Seattle.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.000
 We love you.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.560
 Okay, here's one.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.160
 So we've had an expert write in.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.400
 This is someone from the Association of Track and Field Statisticians.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.360
 - Oh, lovely.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:41.760
 - Yeah.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.520
 His name is Richard Hymans.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:49.520
 Richard writes, in episode 496, Andy described a 2021 Viking attack

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.840
 on a Scottish town called Kirk-Kudbright.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:54.880
 - Yeah.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.560
 - One of the greatest examples of mangling Scottish names I've ever heard.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:05.040
 I'm guessing he meant Kirk-Kubri, spelt Kirk-Kudbright.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.880
 Just such a butchering.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.920
 I've had so many people write it and say, where?

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.080
 And I said, Kirk-Kubri is what it's called.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.120
 It's very embarrassing.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:13.760
 I'm half Scottish.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.560
 - It is.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:14.720
 - It's both.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.320
 - Yeah, giving you a Scottish heritage.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.120
 - Oh, my deep, deep Scottish accent.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.720
 Mortifying.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.200
 Yeah.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.640
 Oh, I've had a couple of people write to me about that, saying I said it.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.840
 So I assumed I said it.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.480
 Was that you?

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.040
 - Yeah, it was me.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.400
 - God, I've been fielding, yeah, fielding templates as well.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.280
 - Do you get complaints to your email, Dan?

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:40.400
 - Not to my email, directly to my Twitter or Instagram or just outside my house.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.560
 - Because no one sends messages to me.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.440
 Is it because I'm classically a very grumpy person

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.920
 who'll tell them to fuck off if they come anywhere near me?

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.240
 - No, I think it more says that you just don't get things wrong.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.680
 - People will probably say that.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.080
 But it's also a lot of people, when we're in the pub after a show,

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.120
 they will try and approach you and tell you things.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.640
 - I'll have none of it.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.680
 - No, you'll have none of it.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:27:59.920
 No.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:05.600
 - I used to do the QI emails, so for the TV show QI.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.720
 And it came up on my, you know, when Facebook tells you things that happened

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.560
 10 years ago or more.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:19.120
 It came up one of my messages, which was it was the last complaint that I dealt with.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.800
 And on QI, we'd compared Klingons and Vulcans to Spartans and Athenians.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.400
 And someone had written into us saying,

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.480
 "Actually, we meant Vulcans and Romulans."

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.680
 - Oh my gosh.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.720
 - Oh, wow.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:35.280
 - That is Wiccan's sensationist all over again.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.480
 - That's great.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.040
 - Yeah.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.360
 - Oh boy, that's brilliant.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.640
 Do we have one last one?

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.800
 This is just a nice little bonus message, actually, from Julia.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:50.560
 And it's a fact that the former Desert Island disc presenter, Kirstie Young,

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.400
 and her husband, have recently bought a deserted island on Loch Lomond.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:54.960
 - No.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.200
 - Yeah.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.000
 - Is that true?

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.240
 - Yeah.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:00.880
 It's called, it's called, oh God, Inchkonachan.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.240
 Inchkonachan.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:08.480
 - And if Andy has mangled that pronunciation, then write into your podcast at qi.com.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.480
 - That's great.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.920
 So they're moving in there.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.400
 - I don't know.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.520
 It's, well, Julia says it's uninhabited, except for it has Scotland's only wild wallabies.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.440
 - Oh, wow.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.400
 - Unfortunately, since the purchase, there has been talk of eradicating the wallabies,

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.600
 which many have protested against.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.240
 And Julia says, "I recently visited by kayak and camped there and can confirm it's very beautiful.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.240
 And as of last weekend, it still has wallabies."

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.720
 - I assume they must be thinking of moving in there, though.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.160
 Otherwise, why would they buy the island?

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:34.720
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.800
 So that'll be great.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.520
 And she can--

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.680
 - Bring five records.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.800
 - Yeah.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:46.400
 I wonder how many islands are owned by celebrities off the Scottish coast?

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.680
 - Loads, loads, loads, loads.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.000
 - Lamb Island, that's owned by Yuri Geller.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.400
 - Right.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.720
 - Because he claims that there's a hidden treasure from a lost Egyptian priestess.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.440
 - Of course he does.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.240
 Of course he does.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.960
 And all I'm going to say is, if you have an island on Scotland and you want to sell it

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.160
 to Yuri Geller, what are you going to say to him to get the price up?

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.360
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.840
 It can't just be it's a lovely island and it's got quite a nice bit with a beach.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.280
 - No, it has to be--

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:11.840
 - Yeah.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.200
 - That's the-- actually, I know about that.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.640
 Is it called Lamb Island, then?

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.600
 - Lamb Island, yeah.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.840
 - It was completely straight when he bought it.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.720
 And then since then, it's now bent into a massive U-shirt.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.200
 It's so weird.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:27.520
 Bye.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:34.720
 - That's 9am energy, goodbye.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.040
 - Yeah.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.960
 - Bye, everybody.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.240
 Thanks so much for listening.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.000
 We hope you've enjoyed it.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.360
 We certainly have.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:47.280
 And if you'd like to cause us further enjoyment, please write to podcast@qi.com.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.120
 Maybe you've noticed something.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.720
 Maybe you've dreamed of one of us.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.320
 Maybe you've got views on the Frasier recasting that we're about to do.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:00.320
 Whatever it is, we're here to read it in your outbox day after day.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.200
 So, see you then.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.080
 All right, take care.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:04.320
 Bye.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.520
 - Really nice.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.400
 - I'm going back to bed.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:16.400
 - Yeah.
