00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
 [phone rings]

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,280
 [speaking Japanese]

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:11,040
 [music]

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,240
 - Hi.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,520
 How was that?

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,320
 - Lovely.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,880
 - James?

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,360
 - Oh yeah, I'm in 7 out of 10.

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,480
 - Okay, well.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,000
 - But you got a factor at the time.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,200
 It's 8.30 in the morning.

12
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,400
 That was powerhouse.

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,600
 That was stadium level.

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,560
 - Welcome, everybody, to a morning-recorded edition

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,000
 of Drop as a Line.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,640
 Will it be much different to our standard early afternoon record?

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,080
 Let's find out.

18
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,000
 As we go through your inboxes, no we don't.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,360
 We go through your outboxes.

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,200
 - We don't know we don't.

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,240
 - This is so slick.

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,480
 - As we go through our inboxes,

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,800
 covering the messages that have come from your outboxes.

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,600
 - Should we come back in maybe about three or four hours?

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,320
 - So, look, let's just get in.

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,080
 We've got some "um" actuallys.

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,400
 We've got some "get yourself off the hooks."

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,720
 Maybe there's some spicy meat lurking in here.

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,640
 Let's find out.

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
 Message one comes.

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,520
 This is a bit of an...

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,160
 It's an "um" actually, but it's a nice one.

33
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,040
 This is from Daniel Wilson, who said a few episodes ago,

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,000
 "We mentioned some facts about the International Owl Center

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,120
 in Houston."

36
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,600
 - "Hoo-hoo-ston."

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,480
 - "Hoo-ston?"

38
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:22,800
 - Brilliant.

39
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,560
 - "It's Houston, right?"

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
 "But it's Houston, M-N."

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,000
 What's that? Minnesota?

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,960
 - Minnesota, yeah, that's right.

43
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,720
 - Minnesota.

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,160
 Daniel, there was a point to Daniel's message.

45
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,160
 He wasn't just congratulating us on mentioning

46
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,960
 the International Owl Center.

47
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,360
 He said, "Houston is a small town in M-N,

48
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,680
 as we now know, Minnesota.

49
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,240
 And the Owl Center is an outgrowth of the relationship

50
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,840
 between the founder, Carla Bloom,

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,000
 and Alice the Great Horned Owl."

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,680
 - Okay, that's nice.

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,320
 - I assume it's nice.

54
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,680
 Relationships can be nice, can not be.

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,640
 Might be antagonistic.

56
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,440
 Daniel continues, "Since the International Owl Center

57
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,160
 is not technically a zoo, and since owls cannot be kept

58
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,880
 as pets, all the owls at the International Owl Center

59
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,160
 are designated as employees.

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,240
 They have four owl employees and three humans.

61
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,240
 Due to old Asian arthritis, Alice,

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,920
 that's Alice the Great Horned Owl,

63
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
 officially retired in 2018.

64
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,880
 I went to her retirement party, which was great fun.

65
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,880
 She didn't attend physically the retirement party,

66
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,600
 but she did attend virtually from her retirement home."

67
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,640
 - That's really nice.

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,440
 I guess if you were an owl employee,

69
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,640
 then you would once have the night shift,

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,280
 and it'd be like, "Oh my god, I'm on day shift today."

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,120
 - Oh, night there, yeah.

72
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,560
 That's really funny.

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,600
 - What's the law behind that?

74
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,120
 It's different to a zoo, I guess, right?

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,160
 The zoo animals are different.

76
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,560
 - Not technically a zoo, I suppose, yeah.

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,520
 - Yeah.

78
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,440
 - 'Cause it would be a good idea at a zoo if all the animals

79
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,320
 at a zoo were employees, you would save on staffing,

80
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,080
 and you would have some more fun, you know, fun adventures.

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,960
 - Leaving do's.

82
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,200
 (laughing)

83
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,640
 - Oh no, the penguins have got together with a fish, no.

84
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,280
 Yeah, anyway, thank you, Daniel.

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,880
 That was lovely bonus info.

86
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,840
 - Yeah, brilliant.

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,280
 - Well, let's move on to an email from jamrainbird,

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,720
 which is about--

89
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,920
 - Sorry, who?

90
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,440
 - Jamrainbird?

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,080
 - Brilliant.

92
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,440
 That's not a real name, is it?

93
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,080
 - I think so, yeah.

94
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,120
 - Who is it?

95
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,480
 Jam, first name.

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,360
 Rainbird, surname.

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,200
 That's not someone who's having their breakfast

98
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,600
 in the conservatory and just pick three random things

99
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,480
 to give them a name.

100
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,240
 (laughing)

101
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,000
 - That's an employee from the birds, actually.

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,960
 (laughing)

103
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,760
 Well, Jam writes, "James confirmed my understanding somewhat

104
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,920
 when he said that tortoises have toes."

105
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,400
 Do you remember this?

106
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,600
 We were talking about tortoises having--

107
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,360
 - Yeah, so the idea is that sometimes people put tortoises

108
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,720
 in the water to save them, thinking that they're turtles,

109
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,520
 and so the best way to tell is that tortoises have toes.

110
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,720
 - Yeah, exactly that.

111
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,600
 And Jam says, "Tortoise equals land turtle.

112
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,960
 Water turtle doesn't need toes.

113
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,680
 Makes sense to me.

114
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,560
 Tortoises have toes."

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,360
 Great.

116
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,720
 Dan then repeated, "Total, total 101 times."

117
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,400
 (laughing)

118
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,280
 - Okay, that was Dan's joke, wasn't it?

119
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,480
 - Roughly, yeah.

120
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,680
 I think it's a proposed mnemonic.

121
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,040
 Maybe you said it one or two times, Dan,

122
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,240
 but it felt like a lot.

123
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:26,000
 Unfortunately, total sounds more like turtle than tortoise,

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,040
 so Dan's mnemonic makes me think that it is turtles

125
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,520
 that have toes and tortoises that don't,

126
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,400
 which is the opposite.

127
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,880
 (laughing)

128
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,480
 - Oh, no, Dan.

129
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,920
 - Yeah, I got a lot of kickback from that attempt

130
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,520
 of a new name.

131
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,800
 Everyone's saying it should actually

132
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,520
 be turtles the other way around.

133
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,880
 I was putting it on the wrong side.

134
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,400
 - No.

135
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,920
 - Neither work, Andy, neither work.

136
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,760
 (laughing)

137
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,520
 - And then, worryingly, Jam says,

138
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,520
 "Even more, unfortunately, I just googled tortoises

139
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,440
 and turtles and discovered that both tortoises

140
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,920
 and other turtles have toes."

141
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,480
 Query needed.

142
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,080
 Tortoises certainly have more toes.

143
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,280
 - Yeah.

144
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
 - They'll have the same skeletal structure

145
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,600
 because they're all--

146
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
 - I would say so.

147
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
 - Because we're all the same, deep down.

148
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,920
 - I read this from a conservationist

149
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,720
 who was saying that people are doing this

150
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,680
 and that it's a problem.

151
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,440
 And this was their kind of rule of thumb,

152
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,160
 but perhaps it's a rule of toes

153
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,240
 that doesn't quite always work.

154
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,280
 - I think it's a pretty good--

155
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,880
 You can definitely tell more toes on a tortoise than a--

156
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,360
 - For sure.

157
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,840
 - Yeah, yeah.

158
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,440
 I think it works.

159
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,520
 And if you're at the water's edge now,

160
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,240
 just drop it in.

161
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,120
 It'll probably be fine.

162
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,440
 - No, I think what we're saying, actually,

163
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
 is just leave it to the experts.

164
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,800
 Like, whether it's a turtle, a tortoise, a terrapin,

165
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,840
 or any other animal beginner with tea, just leave it.

166
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,400
 Let it be--

167
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,800
 - Tiger.

168
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
 - It's a tiger.

169
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,200
 Rub it by the toe.

170
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,800
 - Don't return it to the water.

171
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,160
 Don't take it.

172
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,000
 Oh, here's the most annoying email in the inbox.

173
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,120
 This was, do you remember Dan guessing the day of the week

174
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,600
 when I said, you know, people can get it.

175
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
 People, there's math sevens who can get it right.

176
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,440
 I said 24 February 1603.

177
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,960
 Dan, do you remember what you guessed?

178
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,520
 - Monday.

179
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:07,920
 - Yeah.

180
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,120
 Well, Heather Morgan writes,

181
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,360
 "I'm sure many people have told you this already,

182
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,520
 but A, 24 February 1603 was the day Catherine Howard died."

183
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,120
 Interesting.

184
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,000
 - Oh.

185
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,440
 - Yeah, on a Monday.

186
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,280
 - And yeah, B, it was a Monday.

187
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,760
 You're right.

188
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,560
 By sheer chance.

189
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,840
 It's so annoying.

190
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,680
 - Well, someone pointed out that actually,

191
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,040
 I'm probably wrong because the calendars have changed,

192
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,520
 haven't they?

193
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,760
 - Oh, yes, they have.

194
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,640
 - Yeah.

195
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,320
 So I think, I can't remember.

196
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,680
 I briefly saw the message.

197
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,280
 It might have been a Wednesday or something like that.

198
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,520
 - So the calendar, there was a point where the calendar

199
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,440
 switched over from Gregorian to Julian

200
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,400
 or the other way around.

201
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,080
 - I think this might have taken it into account

202
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,520
 because you don't remember at school.

203
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,840
 It's like, "Divorced beheaded died,

204
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
 divorced, beheaded on a Monday.

205
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,400
 Survived."

206
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,080
 - So good.

207
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:05,280
 We've got a slightly mystical email from Nathan Galamore Strong.

208
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,080
 - Oh.

209
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,400
 - Nathan.

210
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,360
 - What a Galamore.

211
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,080
 - Galamore name.

212
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,840
 - Right, let me preface this by saying,

213
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,600
 I have no idea why I'm telling you this.

214
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,080
 Exciting.

215
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,200
 I often listen to the podcast just before bed,

216
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,880
 and this was sometimes results in some of my dreams

217
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,120
 containing some aspects of the facts or discussions

218
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,240
 during that particular episode.

219
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,960
 - Right.

220
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,680
 - Trippy.

221
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,640
 Last night, I had a dream that I was in a pub,

222
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,840
 and none other than James Harkin came in.

223
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,480
 I freaked out with excitement,

224
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,240
 mentioning to my wife about who it was

225
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,440
 and if I should go and say hi.

226
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,440
 - Yep, do say hi if I ever walk in a pub.

227
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,480
 - Well, Nathan goes on.

228
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,400
 I built up the courage to walk over and explain

229
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,520
 that I'm a huge fan.

230
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,040
 James then gave me the most disdainful look.

231
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:56,640
 And when I asked for a photo, he begrudgingly agreed

232
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,200
 and posed with the most sour look on his face

233
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
 before telling me to leave him alone.

234
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,040
 - Oh, wow.

235
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,040
 - I woke up in a state of utter shock.

236
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,400
 That's, yeah, well, that's what I like.

237
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,120
 - Checks out.

238
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
 - Only in dreams.

239
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,720
 Like, in real life, I'm actually quite nice

240
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,840
 if you ask me for a photo,

241
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,960
 but if you do it in a dream, I will be absolutely livid.

242
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,920
 - That's exactly right.

243
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,640
 That's the way around.

244
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,080
 James lives in the other realm where he's grumpy.

245
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,960
 Yeah, he says, "I now have an irrational fear

246
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,320
 "that if I ever meet James in real life,

247
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,840
 "this dream will become a reality."

248
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,480
 Could you ask James if this is a weird premonition,

249
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,920
 or if he is, as I suspect,

250
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,040
 actually a pleasant human being?

251
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,160
 Well, he is.

252
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,920
 I cannot rest, Nathan says.

253
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,680
 - I'd love to know one day,

254
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,520
 because there is a possibility that one day,

255
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,200
 James, you're having a really terrible day.

256
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,400
 You're walking to a pub.

257
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,520
 You just don't need it.

258
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,200
 This guy's like, "What a dream."

259
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,080
 You're like, "Jesus."

260
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,280
 Like, you know, that's good deal.

261
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,640
 - I'm fucking out of that to leave the game.

262
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,360
 - Well, he's even better.

263
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,600
 Well, he's got Nathan, something strong.

264
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,800
 - Gallimaw strong.

265
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,160
 - Nathan Gallimaw strong.

266
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,560
 - Yeah.

267
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,240
 It's quite a sci-fi name, isn't it?

268
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
 - Yeah, you're pissed off already.

269
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,240
 You walked into a pub.

270
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,720
 A bag comes up saying, "I am Nathan Gallimaw strong."

271
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,560
 - In that tone of voice.

272
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,280
 - Yep.

273
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,880
 - Just let me get to the fucking bar.

274
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,200
 - Yeah.

275
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,480
 I'm so excited for this meeting.

276
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,800
 - I know.

277
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
 He says, "It's worth pointing out,

278
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,720
 I love," I assume he means live,

279
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,760
 "nowhere near London,

280
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,720
 and likely will never run into any of Team Fish,

281
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,400
 but this is haunting me."

282
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,280
 - Oh, we travel.

283
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,760
 - Wow.

284
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,480
 - We travel around.

285
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,120
 - We do.

286
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,480
 - Dancing Liverpool right now

287
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,520
 when we're recording this.

288
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:25,760
 - Oh, yeah.

289
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,240
 - Exactly.

290
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,360
 And I'll be in York.

291
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
 Well, this is, Windsor's going out.

292
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,400
 - You will have been in York.

293
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,240
 - Yeah, and Leeds.

294
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,880
 - Yeah.

295
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,040
 - But you will no longer be in those places.

296
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,600
 - Exactly.

297
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,760
 - So, like, search your recent memory

298
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,240
 if you live in Liverpool, York, or Leeds

299
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,160
 for having maybe seen him and thought,

300
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,480
 "Is that?"

301
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,200
 No, maybe it wasn't.

302
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,600
 I don't know.

303
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,000
 - Check all your photos and see if there's

304
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,320
 a strange, bespectacled man in the background

305
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,960
 of any of them.

306
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,360
 - Hairy, really hairy.

307
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,120
 Look for the hair and the glasses together.

308
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,880
 - Was that sort of bigfoot?

309
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,320
 Yeah, walking around.

310
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,800
 Is anyone, I'm just curious, in the inbox,

311
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,520
 going to defeat either Nathan Gallimaw strong

312
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,840
 or jam Rain Bird as a name?

313
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,840
 - No, I don't think so.

314
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,480
 I've got, well, yeah, up to you, really.

315
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,120
 - I'm very excited to see what's coming.

316
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,920
 - All right.

317
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,360
 We've got a few first names, which are,

318
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,960
 you know, they're less rounded.

319
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,240
 But, so, for example, Courtney, Courtney writes,

320
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,360
 "Over the years I have nearly written in a number of times.

321
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,040
 However, today I had to.

322
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,760
 Please tell Neil Gaiman that our families still say "bygals"

323
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,160
 as his mother does, rather than bagels.

324
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,600
 We're from Whitechapel, East London,

325
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,120
 and all the locals still do.

326
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,960
 However, when I talk to anyone outside the postcode,

327
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,400
 I have to say it like the Americans do.

328
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,760
 So there is still a bygle movement.

329
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,640
 - How interesting.

330
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:46,960
 - Yeah.

331
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,160
 - And Whitechapel is down the road.

332
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,480
 - Yeah.

333
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,200
 And we got another, we got a second email on this saying,

334
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,320
 you're saying it wrong.

335
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,920
 I nearly had to stop listening to the episode.

336
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,680
 It's bygles, bygles, bygles, bygles.

337
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,480
 Don't ever get it wrong again.

338
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,520
 - Wow, I didn't realize there was such a...

339
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,760
 I mean, I know Neil said that there was a problem with him,

340
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,680
 and not a problem with him and his mother.

341
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,840
 Just a discussion with him and his mother.

342
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,160
 They're not now estranged over the pronunciation of bygle.

343
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,040
 But I didn't realize it was such a hot topic.

344
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,240
 - It's a hot potato.

345
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
 - I don't think I've ever heard anyone say it.

346
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,960
 - Hot potato, I think.

347
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,760
 - Very nice.

348
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
 - Can't let them, what were you saying?

349
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,320
 - No, I just, I don't think, you know, even in East London,

350
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,480
 I've ever heard someone say by...

351
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,880
 You know, used to go all the time to the bagel shops,

352
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,760
 which are on Brick Lane,

353
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,600
 which are very famous late night horns

354
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,520
 for when you're kicked out of pubs.

355
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,880
 - Close to Whitechapel, I would say.

356
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,280
 - Exactly.

357
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,320
 - But they don't have a...

358
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,680
 They might be bygles shops then,

359
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,360
 as in they don't have a pronunciation guide

360
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,160
 on the front of the shop.

361
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,200
 - But I just never heard anyone in the vicinity going,

362
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,080
 let's get a bygle.

363
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,160
 You know, you know, listening out loud on the streets,

364
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,680
 as I do, as you know, Andy.

365
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,000
 - All right, so bagels bygles sorted.

366
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,040
 We have had a great email from Noah Levine,

367
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
 and this is a call forward to an episode

368
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,880
 that hasn't even been broadcast yet, I think.

369
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,480
 - Wow.

370
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,880
 - I know.

371
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,400
 Adding to the list of weird sports I've discovered lately,

372
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
 I just learned about walk racing.

373
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,520
 - Okay.

374
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,080
 - And it's where you ride down a huge,

375
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,320
 I think an icy slope on a walk.

376
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,040
 - On a walk?

377
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,760
 Yeah, nice.

378
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,360
 - What's that referring to though?

379
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,040
 I don't remember us talking about weird spots.

380
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,480
 - We didn't talk about walk racing,

381
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,040
 but the fact is this, Nathan Evans,

382
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,320
 who recorded the chart-topping sea shanty Wellerman.

383
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,240
 - Oh, gosh.

384
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,880
 - Represented Scotland in the World Walk Racing Championship 2022.

385
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,080
 - How did I not find that in my research?

386
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,800
 That's incredible.

387
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,320
 - We've just recorded, but haven't yet put out

388
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,840
 an episode about sea shanties.

389
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,960
 - Yeah, yeah.

390
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,480
 Won't go out for a few weeks, actually.

391
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:48,960
 - Right.

392
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,440
 - And this episode from 1999.

393
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,160
 - We missed this.

394
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,640
 - Can we quickly rebook the Soho?

395
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,160
 Just get in.

396
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,000
 Do this extra bit.

397
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,320
 - That's a great fact though, really.

398
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,800
 - I know.

399
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,440
 - Yeah, that's cool.

400
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,600
 - Do we want to reopen the Wicca Satan box?

401
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,960
 - Okay.

402
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,680
 - Yeah, I like that box.

403
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
 - I think we've got a...

404
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,640
 I'm going to open the box from a different angle now.

405
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,360
 - Okay.

406
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
 - There's a second face in the box to be opened.

407
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,200
 And it's interesting because Jamie Lerner Brecher writes,

408
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,960
 "Like everyone else who seems to write into this email address,

409
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,640
 long-time listener, first-time writer."

410
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,160
 Well, people, you know, once they've had a reply from me,

411
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,280
 they don't feel the need to...

412
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,960
 A lot of them actually put me on a plot list immediately

413
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,840
 after getting my reply.

414
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,520
 - You just replied back going, "Sorry, did you get my reply?"

415
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,840
 - I put read receipts on like the most irritating people

416
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,400
 on the planet.

417
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,000
 "I'll need a receipt that you've seen this email, please."

418
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,240
 Right. "To correct a correction from the recent drop of the line,

419
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,480
 brackets, correct-ception, the Satanic Temple is definitely

420
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,400
 not just a libertarian organization.

421
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,160
 I'm a leftist."

422
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,080
 That's Jamie writing, not me.

423
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,720
 I obviously vote GB News.

424
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,480
 It's a way for people who are either atheists

425
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,240
 or don't believe in organized religion

426
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,360
 to get the same protections in the USA offered to religious people.

427
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,080
 So there was a recent ruling about reproductive justice

428
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,920
 and Jamie writes, "I joined the Satanic Temple

429
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,160
 because one of its main tenets is bodily autonomy

430
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,280
 and the right to an abortion.

431
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,000
 As a non-practicing but culturally Jewish atheist,

432
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,760
 this was an organized religion I could get behind."

433
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,480
 And they're trying to do other cool things.

434
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,920
 And he goes on, "It's also extremely different

435
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,280
 than the Church of Satan or Wiccans.

436
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
 And while you guys did say that, it was half a sentence

437
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,720
 and I'm sure left people confused."

438
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,800
 - Yeah, fair enough.

439
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,600
 - They're trying to do other things.

440
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,000
 They're trying to end corporal punishment in schools.

441
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,880
 Sounds like a good idea.

442
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,120
 And they're trying to get a Satanic prayer at the 50-yard line

443
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,360
 of a public high school football game

444
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,240
 since the Supreme Court recently ruled that legal for Christians.

445
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,280
 I don't understand that.

446
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,040
 - That's interesting.

447
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,320
 Well, I do watch a lot of college football

448
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
 and American football.

449
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,040
 And I assume he doesn't mean during the game.

450
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,800
 - I don't.

451
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,240
 - He's doing a prayer during the game.

452
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,280
 It must be before the game

453
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,520
 when they do the National Anthems and stuff, I suppose.

454
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,440
 - Could you do it during the game

455
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,560
 but at the edge of the line?

456
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,320
 As in where, you know, at the edge of the field,

457
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,120
 you could pray there.

458
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,760
 - You could.

459
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,840
 Usually you have, this is quite interesting.

460
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,320
 So at the side of the field of American football,

461
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,240
 you have a load of referees there

462
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,000
 and they're looking out for anything going wrong.

463
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,880
 It's not like in soccer where you have like three referee

464
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,720
 and two lines when you have loads of referees.

465
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,120
 And you also have all of the substitutes,

466
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,400
 of which there's lots.

467
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,240
 And you also have the managers, the coaches there.

468
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,640
 Now the coaches are running up and down

469
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,800
 because they need to see everything that's happening.

470
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,120
 And American football teams, a lot of them,

471
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,760
 employ one person whose job it is

472
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,720
 to pull the manager, the coach, out of the way

473
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,240
 if he's going to run into a referee.

474
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,880
 So he doesn't have to look where he's running.

475
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,560
 He can just run up and down the line.

476
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,480
 And if he's about to hit a line judge,

477
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,720
 they just grab him and pull him out of the way.

478
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,440
 - That's incredible.

479
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,360
 - So they have to run with him, right?

480
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,200
 - Yeah, they run behind him the whole way.

481
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,920
 And they're always watching that he doesn't bump into people.

482
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,800
 - Oh, I see.

483
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,720
 So they're kind of side-running,

484
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,800
 sideways running and hauling him out of the way

485
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,240
 because he's watching the game.

486
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,880
 They're just looking at the pitch.

487
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,480
 They're looking to his left and right

488
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,240
 to make sure that he doesn't run into anyone.

489
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,440
 - That's incredible.

490
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,520
 - It feels like with only a minimum more effort,

491
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,240
 you could get a sedan chair for the coach.

492
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,800
 And they'd be carried up and down the line.

493
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
 - The thing is, it's a matter of,

494
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,240
 if you have to employ two people to do that,

495
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,440
 you only have to employ one person to dodge him out of the way.

496
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,200
 But sedan chair requires two people.

497
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,800
 - It doesn't sound like a game is an efficient hiring.

498
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,800
 If the sidelines are thronged with referees and lines,

499
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,440
 it sounds like there's a little fat here

500
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,520
 to add another employee.

501
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,160
 - Yeah, I guess so.

502
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,360
 - I think that's worth it.

503
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,000
 - But James, has there ever been any sort of attempts

504
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,520
 of sabotage where the opposing team will place someone

505
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,440
 in the way and take the coach down

506
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,200
 so that he's sort of injured and you lose him for a while?

507
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,920
 - I see what you mean.

508
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,200
 The thing is that your team are all on one side of the,

509
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,800
 of the pitch and the other team own the other sidelines.

510
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,520
 So you're kind of always on the opposite side to them.

511
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
 - So you need a mole.

512
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,080
 You need someone on the inside.

513
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,640
 - Just a little mole, building your little mole, hell.

514
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,240
 - That's such an amazing thing.

515
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,560
 What's the career progression of that job?

516
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,520
 - I don't know actually.

517
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,040
 - You move into bodyguarding, I think,

518
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,960
 because it's sort of dodging, like taking a bullet for someone.

519
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,240
 It's just one or two steps up

520
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,800
 from stopping and bumping into an alignment.

521
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,280
 - I guess so.

522
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,080
 - So good.

523
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,440
 What a great job.

524
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,480
 That's amazing.

525
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,840
 - I've just checked the prayer thing.

526
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,440
 It turns out it's a high school football coach

527
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,480
 who wanted the right to pray on the 50 yard line after each game.

528
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,040
 Any players who wanted to participate

529
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,440
 and they were said, they were told, yes, you can.

530
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,240
 So that's fine.

531
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,320
 So they're just asking for the right to do the...

532
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,960
 - I was in Waterstones last night

533
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,040
 and I was looking around in Liverpool

534
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,000
 and the wicker section is directly

535
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,440
 above the witchcraft section.

536
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,480
 And I just wonder if that annoys them as well.

537
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,120
 Just the proximity towards them.

538
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,440
 - Yeah, but it's not above the Satan satanic sex

539
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,720
 in the woodlands section.

540
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,320
 - Yeah, that's true.

541
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,680
 - Which most Waterstones do have.

542
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,880
 - Yeah, yeah.

543
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,920
 - They do.

544
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,840
 Liverpool was missing it for so long, but yeah.

545
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,720
 - Yeah, yeah.

546
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,160
 - Okay, and now we're closing the box.

547
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:34,000
 - Right.

548
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,880
 - We now come onto the...

549
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,440
 This is the big...

550
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,280
 - Why are we not keeping it in a wicker basket?

551
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,080
 Why is it in a box?

552
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,240
 - Lack of imagination by me.

553
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,040
 That's much...

554
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,680
 Oh, for next time.

555
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,640
 Don't say next time.

556
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,800
 Okay, well, look, I was thinking,

557
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,560
 by the way, as I was walking around today,

558
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,120
 if we had a fish restaurant,

559
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,240
 we could call it in no particular order.

560
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
 - Very good.

561
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,080
 Although orders also are things that you do in restaurants.

562
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
 - Yeah, it's really right there on the tin, isn't it?

563
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,200
 In no particular order.

564
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,000
 - Yeah, it is.

565
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,800
 - And what it is, is if someone walks in

566
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,320
 and they take their table,

567
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,640
 they might get their order taken straight away,

568
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,800
 or they might have to wait 45 minutes for their order.

569
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,120
 - Oh, I thought it was more like,

570
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,840
 "Hey, why hasn't the main come before the starter?

571
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,360
 What's the dessert coming next?"

572
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,920
 - Oh, it's like...

573
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,680
 - And bring them out in no particular order.

574
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,440
 - It's like, is it Wagamama?

575
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,400
 Or they always warn you?

576
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,360
 - Oh, yeah.

577
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,800
 - Just in case you don't know,

578
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,480
 the food comes any order.

579
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,680
 - Yeah.

580
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,600
 - And it's...

581
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,160
 They're always...

582
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,360
 They're so worried that you're going to be annoyed about it.

583
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,080
 - Well, yeah.

584
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,800
 That's because they always bring the ice cream

585
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,920
 and then 20 minutes later,

586
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,600
 they bring the hot sauce, wings,

587
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,040
 or whatever it is that you've ordered.

588
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,920
 It's like, "Oh, the ice cream was ready, sorry."

589
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:56,320
 - Just in case you've never been to a Wagamama.

590
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,560
 - Anyway, look, we've come...

591
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,040
 - It is such a weird restaurant,

592
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,920
 when you point out that.

593
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,840
 And then they just draw all over your place, man, buddy.

594
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,240
 - Yeah, it's true, because I go to restaurants

595
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,280
 to deliberately ask for a place mat that I can color in.

596
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,960
 I don't want someone else to do it for me.

597
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,520
 - So that is a kind of long-winded way

598
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,960
 of getting around to me saying,

599
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,400
 "We're now reaching the main course."

600
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,600
 - Oh, great.

601
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,320
 - Sorry, I just thought of hors d'oeuvres,

602
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,440
 and I thought, you know, that's where I was going with that.

603
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,640
 But we had some fun along the way, yeah.

604
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,480
 Right, in the Neil Gaiman episode,

605
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,680
 which went out a couple of weeks ago,

606
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:42,560
 Dan brought up a guy who was pushing a peanut-upper

607
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:48,160
 mountain in Colorado with his nose called Pikes Peak.

608
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,200
 That's the name of the mountain, not the men.

609
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,320
 And I said, "Wow, what do people do in Colorado for fun?

610
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,480
 If you're in Colorado, can you write it and tell us?"

611
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,480
 There are so many fish listeners in Colorado,

612
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,200
 and they've all been in the inbox in the last couple of weeks.

613
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,080
 - Really?

614
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,800
 - Yeah.

615
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,360
 - That's great.

616
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,040
 So now, next time we go to Colorado,

617
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,680
 we have a full list of things that we can do for fun.

618
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,880
 - It's genuinely double-figures,

619
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,560
 the number of people who've written in.

620
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:14,960
 - Wow.

621
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,360
 - Wow.

622
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:15,760
 - Yeah.

623
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,880
 - What's the most interesting thing?

624
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,120
 - Well, let's get into it.

625
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,640
 Beckett writes...

626
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,280
 - Long parts.

627
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,400
 - So, James...

628
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,920
 Main thing to do in Colorado is waiting for Godot.

629
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,320
 Brilliant.

630
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,160
 Hi, fish.

631
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,680
 I've been listening to your podcast for years

632
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,520
 and never thought I'd hear a local story on it.

633
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,120
 Not only did I already know about the man

634
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,440
 who pushed a peanut up Pikes Peak with his nose,

635
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,480
 but there were daily play-by-play updates about it at the time.

636
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,960
 It was big news/nose.

637
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,920
 The irony is that there is plenty to do in Colorado.

638
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,600
 We are one of the most active states with a thriving outdoor culture

639
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,200
 that encourages skiing, hiking, biking, paddleboarding, you name it.

640
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,360
 We also have several beautiful national parks

641
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,120
 and a world-renowned film festival.

642
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,320
 That being said, we moved recently from Washington, D.C.

643
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,440
 to the suburbs of Denver,

644
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
 and I find it mind-numbingly boring

645
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,000
 and commoditonous out here.

646
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,200
 - You're sincerely pushing a peanut up a hell.

647
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,360
 Beckett.

648
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,400
 Beckett.

649
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,440
 - I should say that's not a universal opinion

650
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,200
 by the people of Colorado who've written in.

651
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,440
 A lot of them are very happy about the outdoor activities.

652
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,600
 Yeah, it seems like a very outdoorsy place, basically.

653
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,040
 - Yeah, I think I said, but maybe cut that it's a big skiing place, isn't it?

654
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,000
 - Oh, nice.

655
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,280
 Tim writes, Tim lives in Colorado.

656
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,840
 I can confirm that, one, there are things to do other than push peanuts up 14ers,

657
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,240
 which is mountains over 14,000 feet.

658
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,040
 And two, if there is a stupid thing that could be done outdoors,

659
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,800
 someone in Colorado will do it.

660
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,960
 And there are 53 14ers in Colorado,

661
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
 and lots of people try and climb them all,

662
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,920
 but they also have Frozen Dead Guy Day.

663
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,120
 - Oh, Dan's mentioned that before on the podcast.

664
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,080
 - Oh, yeah.

665
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,840
 - Do you remember that?

666
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,160
 - I don't remember it.

667
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,400
 - It was, now, I might get it mixed up with an episode of The Simpsons,

668
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,200
 but there was a guy who got frozen and died.

669
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,800
 - Well, I've got a little detail here.

670
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,120
 - Okay, go on.

671
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,400
 - There's a guy who frozen his shed,

672
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
 so you're exactly right, James,

673
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,400
 and there are things like a hearse parade and coffin races

674
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,800
 where a team has to run up and down hills of snow

675
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,400
 while carrying someone in a coffin.

676
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,960
 - That's right.

677
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,080
 - Wow.

678
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,800
 Just a quick little quiz for us here,

679
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,760
 because I've just brought it up.

680
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,360
 We get analytics of our listeners.

681
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,920
 We, you know, it can tell us where people are listening from

682
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,240
 if we look into our data.

683
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,000
 So I've just brought up America.

684
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
 So for the last seven days,

685
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,720
 what do you think is the most, the number one city?

686
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,200
 - New York?

687
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,760
 - Number one, no, it's number two.

688
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,000
 - Oh, is it Denver?

689
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,800
 - Oh, dang.

690
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,120
 - No, but Denver does appear on the list.

691
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,600
 - Does it?

692
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,160
 - It's at six.

693
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,480
 - I'm going to say Denver's at six.

694
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,360
 - It's at six.

695
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,160
 - Oh, sorry, it's at six.

696
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,200
 - It's at six, yes.

697
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,640
 - Because we've had 10 people write in,

698
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,920
 so that can't be right.

699
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,760
 I'm going to say Houston, but not Houston, Texas.

700
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,600
 Houston, Minnesota.

701
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,680
 - Is it going to be LA, New Orleans, Chicago?

702
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,960
 - So directly below it is New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

703
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,600
 San Francisco comes further down, but yeah,

704
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,560
 it's slightly surprising.

705
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,680
 - Boston, Seattle.

706
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,720
 - Still a big city.

707
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,600
 Seattle is right.

708
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,280
 - Oh, well done, Andy.

709
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,640
 - Yes, in the last seven days.

710
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,080
 - I thought, what are we most like?

711
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,560
 - Frasier.

712
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
 - Exactly.

713
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,360
 - The new series.

714
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,240
 - Day.

715
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,240
 - Who would we all be in Frasier?

716
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,880
 Anna is Roz.

717
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,080
 - Oh, yeah.

718
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,480
 - Sarcastic, wine lover.

719
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,840
 That fits.

720
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,480
 - Well, Daphne's from Manchester, isn't she?

721
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,160
 - Do you want to be Daphne?

722
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,880
 - Yeah.

723
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,400
 - Although Dan's got a weird accent.

724
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,680
 - That's true.

725
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,320
 - Yeah.

726
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,680
 But I think I'm probably the dog.

727
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,000
 - You're Eddie?

728
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,320
 - Yeah.

729
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,160
 - I think you're the chair.

730
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,200
 Still there in the corner.

731
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,160
 Good night, everyone.

732
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:20,720
 - I think either of you could be Frasier, actually.

733
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,160
 - What?

734
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
 - You obviously think of yourself as a Niles.

735
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,360
 - Yeah.

736
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,480
 - I mean, there's nothing.

737
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,040
 Guys, good luck knocking me off the Niles perch,

738
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,120
 which I've been polishing every day for the last 10 years.

739
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,800
 No one's going to step up and be the dad?

740
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,520
 - I don't really, I haven't really watched.

741
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,320
 - You're the oldest.

742
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,720
 - Yeah.

743
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,360
 - All right.

744
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,760
 - You used to be in the police.

745
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
 You got shot in the hip actually during a robbery.

746
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,720
 Actually, wow, that's weird.

747
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,440
 You, yeah.

748
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,680
 That's it.

749
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,880
 - I like spots.

750
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,000
 He likes spots, doesn't he?

751
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,880
 - You like sports.

752
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,840
 You'll probably, you know the most about beer.

753
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,720
 You like beer.

754
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,440
 He likes beer.

755
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,280
 I think there's a case there.

756
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,200
 - I think you like sitting on me?

757
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:11,920
 - Well, we've got it worked out.

758
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,040
 Great.

759
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,160
 - Nice.

760
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,480
 - Okay.

761
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,720
 What are we talking about?

762
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,360
 - Seattle.

763
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,960
 - Oh, we were talking about a dead man.

764
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,680
 Was it Seattle?

765
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,080
 - Yeah.

766
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,680
 - I just brought that up because of Colorado.

767
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,640
 We've got a lot of listeners.

768
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:22,880
 - Great.

769
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,920
 - Double digits in the inbox.

770
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,720
 - Oh, double digits.

771
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,840
 Yeah, yeah, you're right.

772
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,320
 Okay, great.

773
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,360
 Well, Seattle.

774
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,000
 We love you.

775
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,560
 Okay, here's one.

776
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,160
 So we've had an expert write in.

777
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,400
 This is someone from the Association of Track and Field Statisticians.

778
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,360
 - Oh, lovely.

779
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:41,760
 - Yeah.

780
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,520
 His name is Richard Hymans.

781
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,520
 Richard writes, in episode 496, Andy described a 2021 Viking attack

782
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,840
 on a Scottish town called Kirk-Kudbright.

783
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:54,880
 - Yeah.

784
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,560
 - One of the greatest examples of mangling Scottish names I've ever heard.

785
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:05,040
 I'm guessing he meant Kirk-Kubri, spelt Kirk-Kudbright.

786
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,880
 Just such a butchering.

787
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,920
 I've had so many people write it and say, where?

788
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,080
 And I said, Kirk-Kubri is what it's called.

789
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,120
 It's very embarrassing.

790
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,760
 I'm half Scottish.

791
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,560
 - It is.

792
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:14,720
 - It's both.

793
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,320
 - Yeah, giving you a Scottish heritage.

794
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,120
 - Oh, my deep, deep Scottish accent.

795
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,720
 Mortifying.

796
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,200
 Yeah.

797
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,640
 Oh, I've had a couple of people write to me about that, saying I said it.

798
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,840
 So I assumed I said it.

799
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,480
 Was that you?

800
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,040
 - Yeah, it was me.

801
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,400
 - God, I've been fielding, yeah, fielding templates as well.

802
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,280
 - Do you get complaints to your email, Dan?

803
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:40,400
 - Not to my email, directly to my Twitter or Instagram or just outside my house.

804
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,560
 - Because no one sends messages to me.

805
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,440
 Is it because I'm classically a very grumpy person

806
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,920
 who'll tell them to fuck off if they come anywhere near me?

807
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,240
 - No, I think it more says that you just don't get things wrong.

808
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,680
 - People will probably say that.

809
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,080
 But it's also a lot of people, when we're in the pub after a show,

810
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,120
 they will try and approach you and tell you things.

811
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,640
 - I'll have none of it.

812
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,680
 - No, you'll have none of it.

813
00:27:59,680 --> 00:27:59,920
 No.

814
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,600
 - I used to do the QI emails, so for the TV show QI.

815
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,720
 And it came up on my, you know, when Facebook tells you things that happened

816
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,560
 10 years ago or more.

817
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:19,120
 It came up one of my messages, which was it was the last complaint that I dealt with.

818
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,800
 And on QI, we'd compared Klingons and Vulcans to Spartans and Athenians.

819
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,400
 And someone had written into us saying,

820
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,480
 "Actually, we meant Vulcans and Romulans."

821
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,680
 - Oh my gosh.

822
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,720
 - Oh, wow.

823
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,280
 - That is Wiccan's sensationist all over again.

824
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,480
 - That's great.

825
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,040
 - Yeah.

826
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,360
 - Oh boy, that's brilliant.

827
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,640
 Do we have one last one?

828
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,800
 This is just a nice little bonus message, actually, from Julia.

829
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,560
 And it's a fact that the former Desert Island disc presenter, Kirstie Young,

830
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,400
 and her husband, have recently bought a deserted island on Loch Lomond.

831
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,960
 - No.

832
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,200
 - Yeah.

833
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,000
 - Is that true?

834
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,240
 - Yeah.

835
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,880
 It's called, it's called, oh God, Inchkonachan.

836
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,240
 Inchkonachan.

837
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,480
 - And if Andy has mangled that pronunciation, then write into your podcast at qi.com.

838
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
 - That's great.

839
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,920
 So they're moving in there.

840
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,400
 - I don't know.

841
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,520
 It's, well, Julia says it's uninhabited, except for it has Scotland's only wild wallabies.

842
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,440
 - Oh, wow.

843
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,400
 - Unfortunately, since the purchase, there has been talk of eradicating the wallabies,

844
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,600
 which many have protested against.

845
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,240
 And Julia says, "I recently visited by kayak and camped there and can confirm it's very beautiful.

846
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
 And as of last weekend, it still has wallabies."

847
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,720
 - I assume they must be thinking of moving in there, though.

848
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,160
 Otherwise, why would they buy the island?

849
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,720
 - Yeah, exactly.

850
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

851
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,800
 So that'll be great.

852
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,520
 And she can--

853
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,680
 - Bring five records.

854
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,800
 - Yeah.

855
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,400
 I wonder how many islands are owned by celebrities off the Scottish coast?

856
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,680
 - Loads, loads, loads, loads.

857
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,000
 - Lamb Island, that's owned by Yuri Geller.

858
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,400
 - Right.

859
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,720
 - Because he claims that there's a hidden treasure from a lost Egyptian priestess.

860
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,440
 - Of course he does.

861
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,240
 Of course he does.

862
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,960
 And all I'm going to say is, if you have an island on Scotland and you want to sell it

863
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,160
 to Yuri Geller, what are you going to say to him to get the price up?

864
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,360
 - Yeah, exactly.

865
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,840
 It can't just be it's a lovely island and it's got quite a nice bit with a beach.

866
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,280
 - No, it has to be--

867
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,840
 - Yeah.

868
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,200
 - That's the-- actually, I know about that.

869
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,640
 Is it called Lamb Island, then?

870
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,600
 - Lamb Island, yeah.

871
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,840
 - It was completely straight when he bought it.

872
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,720
 And then since then, it's now bent into a massive U-shirt.

873
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,200
 It's so weird.

874
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,520
 Bye.

875
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:34,720
 - That's 9am energy, goodbye.

876
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,040
 - Yeah.

877
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,960
 - Bye, everybody.

878
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,240
 Thanks so much for listening.

879
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,000
 We hope you've enjoyed it.

880
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,360
 We certainly have.

881
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,280
 And if you'd like to cause us further enjoyment, please write to podcast@qi.com.

882
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,120
 Maybe you've noticed something.

883
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,720
 Maybe you've dreamed of one of us.

884
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,320
 Maybe you've got views on the Frasier recasting that we're about to do.

885
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,320
 Whatever it is, we're here to read it in your outbox day after day.

886
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,200
 So, see you then.

887
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,080
 All right, take care.

888
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,320
 Bye.

889
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,520
 - Really nice.

890
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,400
 - I'm going back to bed.

891
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:16,400
 - Yeah.
