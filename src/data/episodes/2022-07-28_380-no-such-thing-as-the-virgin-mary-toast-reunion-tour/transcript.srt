1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,560
 - Hi everybody, just before we start this week's show,

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,040
 we have an exciting announcement to make.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,520
 - Yes, as you may have heard,

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,040
 we are returning to the road that leads to theaters

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,720
 across the UK and Ireland

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,000
 to perform our new stage show, Nerd Immunity.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,520
 - It's gonna be a live podcast.

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,880
 That's gonna be the second half of every show,

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,840
 completely different every single time.

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,720
 And in the first half, there's gonna be a magnificent

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,160
 first half comedy set,

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,280

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,160
 Okay, go to qi.com/fishevents,

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,000
 but before that, on with the show.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,580
 (upbeat music)

25
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:17,040
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,840
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,760
 coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,600
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,960
 Anna Tyshinski, and James Harkin,

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,480
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

32
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,400
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

33
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,360
 and in no particular order, here we go.

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,160
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,200
 My fact is that the Victorian poet, Elizabeth Barrett Browning,

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,780
 had her spaniel stolen by London's dog banditty

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,440
 on three separate occasions.

38
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,160
 - They sound like at least two euphemisms in that sentence.

39
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,040
 I reckon having your spaniel stolen

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,920
 and London's dog banditty sounds.

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,760
 - It's all true.

42
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,240
 There might be some euphemisms later actually,

43
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,520
 but no, that she had a lovely little spaniel

44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,160
 and it was called flush, flush the dog.

45
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,760
 - But don't.

46
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,000
 - Don't flush the dog.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,840
 - If you're listening.

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,080
 - But this was a huge problem in Victorian London.

49
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,400
 I say huge, it was a medium-sized problem.

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,480
 But for middle-class people who were suddenly getting dogs

51
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,200
 and showing them off and grooming them and breeding them,

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,640
 it was a problem because thieves realized

53
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,440
 you could steal dogs and the owners

54
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,240
 would pay quite a bit to get them back.

55
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,240
 And poor little flush got stolen in 1843 to order.

56
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,780
 She paid the thieves off and they brought it back.

57
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,000
 Then again in 1844, she paid them off again,

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,040
 bit more money this time, she got it back.

59
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,080
 And then in 1846, a third time flush the dog was stolen.

60
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,520
 At which point, flush must have been

61
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,280
 getting used to this routine by now.

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,660
 - At that stage, maybe flush preferred his other owners.

63
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,760
 Although I heard that it was a very, very spoiled dog flush

64
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,420
 and that he would turn his nose up at any bread

65
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,560
 that wasn't buttered.

66
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,920
 So I imagine the dog that was probably

67
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,620
 weren't giving him buttered bread.

68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,740
 - She wrote about him, "If you were but to see him

69
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,260
 eat partridge from a silver fork."

70
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,000
 I mean, very, very over-spoiled dog.

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,840
 Anyway. - Then what?

72
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,800
 What's the end of that clause?

73
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,760
 If you were but to see him eat partridge from a silver fork,

74
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
 what, you pass out with envy?

75
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,580
 I think-- - You're so disgusted

76
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,580
 you leave the room.

77
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,820
 - I've cut it short there.

78
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,100
 So we'll never know.

79
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,220
 It can't have been that interesting.

80
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,060
 Otherwise I would have said,

81
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,820
 if she'd said, "If you were to see him do this,

82
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,880
 you'd shit."

83
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,340
 (laughing)

84
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,900
 - That's her style, I believe it.

85
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,220
 - She claimed that he could have the capacity for literacy.

86
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,140
 She said he recognized the letters A and B

87
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,580
 and that maybe in the course of time,

88
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,980
 he might learn the full alphabet.

89
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,300
 - Wow. - Then again then.

90
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,100
 - So he could send an S-O-S out at some point.

91
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,080
 - No, he could order an ABBA CD, basically.

92
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,240
 - Anyway, well look, he couldn't have done

93
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,960
 any of these things if, as the thieves threatened,

94
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,360
 they were going to cut off his head and paws

95
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,040
 and send them back to Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

96
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,840
 Very distressing, obviously.

97
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,360
 That's what they said they would do.

98
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,480
 - Yeah, that's horrible.

99
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,560
 No wonder she paid up.

100
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,240
 - I read a really good account of it

101
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,280
 of the third time that the dog was stolen

102
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,120
 and she was getting on a bus

103
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,000
 and the dog was just wandering behind her in London,

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,240
 clearly leachless.

105
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,720
 As she got on the bus, turned around,

106
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,400
 looked for the dog and it was gone.

107
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,940
 And instead of getting off to look for her dog,

108
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,260
 she and her sister just stayed on the bus

109
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,460
 and her sister was like,

110
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,860
 "Well, guess there'll be a ransom note when we get back."

111
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,500
 (all laughing)

112
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,300
 - That's a great idea, isn't it?

113
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,420
 If you're in the supermarket

114
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,980
 and you can't be bothered taking your kids home in the car,

115
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,300
 just wait for the ransom note.

116
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,700
 (all laughing)

117
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,260
 - Can I ask what kind of bus we think she was getting?

118
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,540
 It was the 1840s, right?

119
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,340
 Was it like a stagecoach?

120
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,500
 - It might have been a carriage.

121
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,840
 - A carriage.

122
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,500
 - An omnibus, I reckon.

123
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,340
 - An omnibus, yeah.

124
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,180
 - That's what it felt like.

125
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,060
 It felt like she was getting on a proper bus

126
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,900
 when I read the report.

127
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,060
 - I mean, it certainly wasn't a proper bus

128
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,980
 in the sense that we know it

129
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,900
 because it was like six years before proper buses were seen.

130
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,100
 - Was it a rootmaster?

131
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,900
 Yeah, maybe I've read that wrong.

132
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,940
 Maybe carriage.

133
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,100
 Let's go carriage, actually.

134
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,860
 (all laughing)

135
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,700
 - Flushed the dog.

136
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,540
 He must have thought,

137
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,140
 as he was being dognapped for the third time,

138
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,260
 he must have thought, "Mama Mia, here we go again."

139
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,580
 (all laughing)

140
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,420
 - Very good.

141
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,660
 - Thank you.

142
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,580
 - Do you think he sent out an SOS?

143
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,120
 (all laughing)

144
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,600
 Are you giving the punchline to a joke

145
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,720
 that was set up five minutes ago?

146
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,040
 - Yeah, I think I am.

147
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,640
 Anyway, look, the thieves were only interested

148
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,600
 in money, money, money.

149
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,560
 That's what they wanted.

150
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,360
 (all laughing)

151
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,120
 And so they sent this ransom note.

152
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,480
 And there was a lot of dispute in the family

153
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,880
 because her father was very tyrannical.

154
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,200
 He didn't want a ransom paid.

155
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,480
 But there was this contact.

156
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,240
 There was a shoemaker called Taylor

157
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,920
 who was the main player in the dog theft world

158
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,040
 in Victorian London.

159
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,000
 He was involved in a huge number of these thefts.

160
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,940
 He was usually not the guy to steal the dog,

161
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,060
 but he was the guy who would make contact

162
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,940
 and say, "Oh, we've come into this dog."

163
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,640
 (all laughing)

164
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,700
 - That's disgusting.

165
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,660
 - "We've come into the possession of this dog."

166
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,100
 - Oh, sorry, 'cause I thought you meant,

167
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,560
 "All right, okay."

168
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,100
 (all laughing)

169
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,780
 I find it really hard to work out exactly

170
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,380
 what happened on all these occasions

171
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,220
 because Virginia Woolf wrote a fictionalized version

172
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,740
 of Flush's dog napping, didn't she?

173
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,900
 She wrote a biography of this dog

174
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,360
 in which there are loads of explanations

175
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,960
 of how he was taken

176
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,640
 and then how he was gotten back and stuff,

177
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,200
 which God knows what's true and what's not true.

178
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,360
 But the best bits I find probably not true.

179
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
 (all laughing)

180
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,360
 - Yes, it's so funny.

181
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,000
 She wrote the whole thing in 1933,

182
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,080
 or it was published in 1933, certainly.

183
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,120
 It was quite a light book

184
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,520
 off the back of a rather heavy

185
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,640
 and serious brain-training one she'd just written.

186
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,680
 But it was her best-selling book to date,

187
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,520
 which must have been--

188
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,720
 - No.

189
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,840
 - Yes, infuriating.

190
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,820
 - To now, like--

191
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
 - No, to that point in her career,

192
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,900
 it was the most successful.

193
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,280
 Yeah, I don't think it's currently outselling

194
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,740
 when she's down the way.

195
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,080
 I might be wrong.

196
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,220
 - You never know, maybe after this podcast.

197
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,540
 But she was, like, when it first came out,

198
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,260
 she wasn't sure if she should even publish it

199
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,100
 because she thought that people would think

200
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,780
 she was like a frivolous, not very kind of--

201
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,140
 - Yeah, I mean, it's a biography of someone's dog.

202
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,100
 - Yeah, silly lady novelist was the worry that she had.

203
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,660
 - She said, "I must not let myself believe

204
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,200
 that I'm simply a lady-like prattler."

205
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,460
 - Well, maybe write a biography of a human being, Virginia.

206
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,540
 - Talking dog.

207
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,840
 Was she friends with Flush?

208
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,680
 Did she know Flush?

209
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,520
 And did she know Brownie?

210
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,360
 - No, no, no, no.

211
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,520
 The timelines didn't cross over.

212
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,040
 - Just to defend Virginia Woolf

213
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,560
 having abused her for writing about a dog,

214
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,080
 it did have a serious message underneath, didn't it?

215
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,000
 I think she was just worried people wouldn't get it.

216
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,120
 So, well, this is how she defended it anyway,

217
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,000
 writing to her friend.

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,840
 She was like, "Look, it's gonna seem silly

219
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,800
 'cause it looks like it's a biography of a dog.

220
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,220
 But if you read it, well, it's partly, I guess,

221
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,140
 an odor Elizabeth Browning, right?

222
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,340
 Who was a hero for subsequent female writers

223
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,180
 and partly a way of descending into the depths of London

224
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,060
 and reporting on the awful poverty and social injustice there.

225
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,660
 Through the eyes of a dog, yes, but even so.

226
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,100
 So it was vaguely serious.

227
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,460
 But it also featured a pop point,

228
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,020
 which I don't think was in the real life story,

229
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,020
 where the dog was almost sold to a man called Pussy.

230
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,860
 (laughing)

231
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,120
 This part of the story was she got it

232
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,920
 from a friend of hers who initially had been,

233
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,860
 had an offer made from the brother

234
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,180
 of the Reverend Edward Buvery Pusy.

235
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,020
 I think we're saying it.

236
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,200
 - Oh, Pusy is a different name to Pussy.

237
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,520
 - It is a different name.

238
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,360
 (laughing)

239
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,320
 But it is spelled in a similar way.

240
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,360
 - Very similar.

241
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,260
 Dognapping back then was such a big thing in London.

242
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,560
 There was a journalist called Henry Mayhew

243
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,380
 who estimated that in terms of individual dog stealers

244
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,940
 operating in London at his time,

245
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,260
 it was 141 people just going around London, stealing them.

246
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,140
 And he estimated that 45 of them

247
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,100
 did it as their main profession.

248
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,080
 They just actively went into it.

249
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,620
 And you can see there's sort of tables of sort of like 1841,

250
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,140
 dogs stolen, where 43 dogs lost 521,

251
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,940
 people charged 51, people discharged of that 32.

252
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,440
 They just found it really hard to bust people

253
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,600
 who were stealing the dogs.

254
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,360
 - Yeah, hang on Dan, how many dogs did you say stolen?

255
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,040
 - So stolen 43, dogs lost 521.

256
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,880
 But I imagine that there's a blur between those two

257
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,960
 because a lot of these dog nappers got around loopholes

258
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,200
 by if they'd stolen a dog,

259
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,720
 they would do things like make up a missing sign,

260
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,400
 which they would then show if they had the dog

261
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,520
 to a dog dealer and say,

262
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,000
 "Look, I found this missing poster of this dog

263
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,960
 and this is the dog."

264
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,360
 They buy it off them and then sell it.

265
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,140
 So technically, it was a missing dog.

266
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,480
 - The guy who stole the dog makes the poster.

267
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,160
 - Yeah, exactly. - Saying a missing dog.

268
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,360
 - But then he makes the poster

269
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,640
 and then he gives it to a dog dealer and says,

270
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,280
 "I've got this dog on this missing poster,

271
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,440
 can I sell it to you?"

272
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,420
 - Yeah, he's like, "Look, there's a missing poster here.

273
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,740
 Someone's looking for this dog and I found the dog.

274
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,880
 So if I just give it to you,

275
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,620
 then you'll be able to do the deal and get the money

276
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,800
 and just give me half the money for now, it's fine."

277
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,020
 - That's so funny. - That kind of thing.

278
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:04,020
 - I still think that even a total of something like 600 dogs

279
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,920
 lost and reported stolen too.

280
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,120
 Given that there are 141 dog dealers in London,

281
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,400
 45 of whom are doing it full-time,

282
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,280
 that is what, about four dogs per person per year?

283
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,520
 One per quarter?

284
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
 - Yeah, that's a lot of holidays.

285
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,520
 - It's an astonishingly low proportion of dogs.

286
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,360
 I don't know why we're acting like

287
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,240
 this is a lot of dogs to be stolen.

288
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,560
 How's anyone making a profit out of this?

289
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,120
 - Well, they took their time, didn't they?

290
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,920
 Didn't they find out with Elizabeth Barrett Browning

291
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,980
 that they'd spent two years tailing her

292
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,740
 before they took her dog?

293
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,820
 Two years spotting, yeah.

294
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,620
 - Or is that, again, is that the Virginia Wolf story?

295
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,060
 I'm not sure, I can't wait now.

296
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,820
 The other thing is you could make some money on the side

297
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,700
 by stealing a dog, not getting the money back,

298
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,900
 but making dog skin leather gloves,

299
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,580
 which are apparently a luxury item

300
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,300
 that people like to wear.

301
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,020
 They're very soft on the skin.

302
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,140
 - Yeah, have we ever worn dog outside

303
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,600
 of dog skin gloves?

304
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,280
 I've never heard of it before.

305
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,120
 - I don't know if you've seen

306
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,160
 the documentary 101 Dalmatians, but yeah.

307
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,800
 - It wasn't the only dog-related trade.

308
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,520
 This is a bit by the by now,

309
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,720
 but there was a market in 1850s London for fake dog poo.

310
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,560
 - Really?

311
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,760
 - So there were people who were collecting real dog poo

312
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,880
 for tanneries because it helped to soften

313
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,280
 and purify the leather, right?

314
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,800
 - Is fake dog poo just your own poo with some dog hairs

315
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,800
 in it, 'cause it feels like probably is.

316
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,420
 - Oh, God.

317
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,860
 Thankfully, it's just taking mortar from old walls

318
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,100
 and crumbling it into your existing dog poo

319
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,780
 to bulk it out a bit.

320
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,540
 It's a way of making your real dog poo go further.

321
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,660
 The people who traded in it and collected it

322
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,140
 were originally old women who got nicknamed bunters,

323
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,540
 but then men started muscling in

324
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,380
 from about the 1820s onwards,

325
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,820
 and these dog poo collectors would walk the streets

326
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,480
 with the covered basket containing their wares,

327
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,080
 and some of them would wear a black leather glove

328
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,440
 to do their collecting in.

329
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,400
 - Only some of them.

330
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,760
 - Only some of them, because the others,

331
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,600
 they didn't have a glove.

332
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,120
 They said, well, look, it's easier to wash your hands

333
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,680
 than to clean the glove.

334
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
 - I think that's a fair point.

335
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,800
 - Yeah, good, cool, good, cool.

336
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,680
 I knew Anna would be the first one to say.

337
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,840
 - Come on.

338
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,480
 - It was pretty exciting to hear about the fact

339
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,320
 of London being poo-less,

340
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,280
 because in the area that I live particularly,

341
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,400
 there is poo from dogs that have just left

342
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,240
 all over the streets,

343
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,180
 and just the idea that it was picked up

344
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,980
 because people thought it was valuable

345
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,620
 and needing it as part of this tanning process

346
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,380
 means that Victorian London was just clean,

347
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,100
 in that respect, in that respect, I know it's not.

348
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,940
 - Interesting theory,

349
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,420
 'cause I think it was also a sort of thigh-deep

350
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,900
 in horse manure, wasn't it?

351
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,900
 And technically, you could use that as well.

352
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,380
 - It must be really hard to find dog poo

353
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,180
 in a street that's full of horse poo.

354
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,980
 It's almost like the 19th century equivalent

355
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,500
 of finding a needle in a haystack

356
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,440
 is finding a dog poo in a horse poo.

357
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,320
 - That was a saying, I believe that was a popular saying

358
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,160
 at the time.

359
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,400
 (laughing)

360
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,980
 (upbeat music)

361
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:08,320
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

362
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,280
 and that is James.

363
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,880
 - My fact is that the Democratic Republic of Congo

364
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,760
 is planning an official parade

365
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,800
 of its first prime minister's gold tooth.

366
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,640
 - Very cool.

367
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,520
 - You've got to get front row seats for that, haven't you?

368
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,300
 Otherwise, it's just not worth going.

369
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,460
 - Yeah, you're not gonna see it

370
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,860
 from the back of the stadium, are you?

371
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,020
 - No.

372
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,900
 - So, I will quickly give you a short history

373
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,580
 of the Democratic Republic of Congo

374
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,460
 in the last 200 years to explain what's going on here.

375
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,660
 - Right.

376
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,220
 - You might remember that amusing story

377
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,100
 of Henry Martin Stanley finding Dr. Livingston.

378
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,780
 - Oh, wow, we really are going back, okay?

379
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,860
 - We are, we are.

380
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,340
 - So, he said, "Dr. Livingston, I presume,"

381
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,980
 and he found Dr. Livingston.

382
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,600
 But after that, the story took a bit of a turn,

383
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,880
 and Stanley was working on behalf of Leopold II of Belgium

384
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,000
 to create this massive personal tract of land

385
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 where he could almost farm it for ivory,

386
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
 'cause there was so much ivory,

387
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,960
 so many elephants and stuff like that.

388
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,360
 So, he created this huge, huge country

389
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,540
 that was run by Leopold II of Belgium.

390
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,880
 There was then a rubber boom

391
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,480
 because they came up with this idea of buses.

392
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,280
 I don't know if you've heard of those, Dan.

393
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,980
 They came along in the early 20th century,

394
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,740
 and so, Leopold II of Belgium

395
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,540
 forced the population to work on his rubber plantations,

396
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,460
 and literally millions of people died

397
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,660
 in terrible, terrible conditions.

398
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,540
 In 1960, the country got its independence finally,

399
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,220
 and they got a new leader called Patrice Lumumba,

400
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,620
 so they thought he might bring the whole country together.

401
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,460
 But there was one area called Catanga

402
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,020
 that had loads of minerals,

403
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,700
 and the Belgians wanted to keep that under the control

404
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,340
 after independence because they wanted

405
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,980
 all of these minerals.

406
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,580
 Lumumba asked the U.S. and Europe

407
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,220
 to help to control an uprising,

408
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,960
 but U.S. and Europe didn't help,

409
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,080
 and so, he turned to the Soviet Union,

410
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,740
 and obviously, that sent alarm bells ringing

411
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,740
 in Europe and America.

412
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,920
 - It was an awkward time, wasn't it,

413
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,820
 between America and the Soviet Union?

414
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,660
 - It was.

415
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,020
 It was the Cold War.

416
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,860
 - Yeah.

417
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,180
 - So, anyway, they assassinated this guy, Patrice Lumumba,

418
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,500
 and to stop any hero worship,

419
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,420
 they dissolved his body in acid,

420
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,240
 and there was hardly any bits left.

421
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,720
 This gold tooth was remaining

422
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,900
 and was taken to Belgium by one of the people

423
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,260
 who did the crime,

424
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,260
 and then this year, finally, they're gonna get it back,

425
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,100
 and they're gonna have a proper parade,

426
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,660
 and it'll be kind of part of their anniversary

427
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,740
 of independence and all that kind of stuff.

428
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,620
 - I had never heard the story of Patrice Lumumba before,

429
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,640
 and it's really, obviously, it's a completely awful story,

430
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,740
 this coup against him,

431
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,820
 and there were apparently two different plots against him.

432
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,900
 One was CIA/MI6,

433
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,480
 and one was Belgian,

434
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,640
 along with some Congolese officials as well.

435
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,020
 - Yeah, the CIA tried to kill him

436
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,720
 with some poison toothpaste.

437
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,240
 - They apparently found it difficult

438
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,680
 to get the toothpaste onto his toothbrush,

439
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,880
 without being noticed,

440
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,160
 which, it's so rare that toothpaste is applied

441
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,520
 to your toothbrush without you being

442
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,800
 in front of your toothbrush.

443
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,200
 - Unless you're Prince Charles,

444
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,920
 unless you're Prince Charles, in which case,

445
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,360
 it's a twice daily occurrence.

446
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,200
 - Is that right?

447
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,520
 - Yes, I'm not saying they should,

448
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,600
 but if the CIA wanted to knock off Prince Charles

449
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,000
 with this method, he would be a sitting duck.

450
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,840
 (laughing)

451
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,720
 - I was just thinking,

452
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
 it's definitely a two-man job, isn't it?

453
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,140
 One person to distract you so much

454
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,720
 that you don't notice that the other person

455
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,920
 sneaks into your bathroom

456
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,560
 and puts toothpaste on your toothbrush

457
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,400
 that you're holding.

458
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,080
 - But you'd turn back and you'd think,

459
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,800
 "No, actually, you wouldn't think, you wouldn't think,

460
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,900
 "did I put this toothpaste on the brush?"

461
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,740
 - No. - You'd just look at it

462
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,840
 and you'd think-- - What's the other option

463
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,440
 that it's just spontaneously arrived on your toothbrush?

464
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,480
 That doesn't make any sense.

465
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,320
 - Yeah.

466
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,880
 - They'd have to have opened the toothpaste,

467
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
 because I would be suspicious

468
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,000
 if I hadn't got the toothpaste

469
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,120
 out of its special drawer yet,

470
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,080
 to put it on the brush, if you know what I mean.

471
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,840
 - It's a tough location all around, isn't it?

472
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,240
 'Cause if you're brushing your teeth,

473
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,520
 most likely you're staring into a giant mirror,

474
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,560
 which would knock out anyone's chance

475
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,880
 of sneaking up behind you.

476
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,720
 (laughing)

477
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,840
 - That's a really good point.

478
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,880
 Whose tooth do you think is the most expensive,

479
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,000
 John Lennon's, or Elvis Presley's?

480
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,800
 - Does one of them have more teeth in circulation?

481
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,560
 I can't look out why that would be.

482
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,800
 - Oh, yeah, interesting.

483
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,640
 - Okay, this gives you a bit of a clue.

484
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,720
 Both of these are owned by the same guy

485
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,840
 who is a tooth collector of celebrities.

486
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,120
 - Oh, okay.

487
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,720
 - This is a weird tooth fairy, dude.

488
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,480
 (laughing)

489
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,520
 - I'm gonna say John Lennon,

490
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,880
 because there's probably more bits of Elvis Presley

491
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,000
 on the market, like his toenails and so on,

492
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,200
 that you can get access to.

493
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,040
 - I'll say Elvis.

494
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,280
 I'll say Elvis is bigger.

495
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,120
 I think the sort of people who want the teeth

496
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,040
 will be more interested in Elvis than Lennon.

497
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,800
 - I don't know why there are more bits

498
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,880
 of the dismembered Elvis Presley on the market

499
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,400
 than there are of apparently dismembered

500
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,240
 John Lennon.

501
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,520
 I just realized their body parts

502
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,400
 were in circulation at all.

503
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,480
 - Well, I know that we know where his Elvis's wart is.

504
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,560
 It's in a museum in America.

505
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,960
 There's, remember, possibly his toenail

506
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,800
 that we've mentioned.

507
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,720
 - Yes, yeah.

508
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,480
 - So, you know, bits of Elvis are all over the shop.

509
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,800
 - That's a really good argument.

510
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,680
 - James, stop this interminable debate and tell us.

511
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,960
 - The answer is that Elvis Presley's dental crown

512
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,960
 was $10,000, whereas John Lennon's tooth was $31,000.

513
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,600
 - Yes!

514
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,000
 - So, three times more for John Lennon.

515
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,920
 - Fuck it, Murray.

516
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,960
 - But that's a crown.

517
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,800
 That's different.

518
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,120
 It's a crown, although he was the king.

519
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,960
 - Exactly.

520
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,480
 So, they do, they call it the king's crown.

521
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,320
 (laughing)

522
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,800
 And it was worn by Elvis Presley

523
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,440
 until he cracked it on a microphone

524
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,600
 while performing in Las Vegas in 1971.

525
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,000
 And they eventually found its way

526
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,480
 into the collection of Michael Zuck.

527
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,880
 And Michael Zuck also bought one of John Lennon's

528
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,640
 extracted teeth, which Lennon had given

529
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,720
 to his housekeeper.jallet.

530
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,560
 - Wow.

531
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,400
 - A weird move.

532
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,240
 Let's say a weird move.

533
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,080
 - It's not, it's not.

534
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,920
 - Unless his housekeeper asked for it.

535
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,920
 - Look how much it's worth.

536
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,600
 If you were as famous as Elvis or John Lennon,

537
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,640
 if I cut off a fingernail, if I cut a strand of hair,

538
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,560
 hand it to someone, it's gonna make them money.

539
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,760
 You are, your whole body is worth stuff.

540
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,400
 I think it's a wonderful present.

541
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,080
 - I've got a question about the Elvis thing,

542
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
 which is that you said he cracked his crown

543
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,480
 on a microphone during a gig.

544
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,360
 Now look, I'm not saying our gigs go like Elvis's.

545
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,040
 I'm not saying our audiences are as raucous,

546
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,280
 but that's quite the gig where you're shoving your microphone

547
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,200
 into your mouth to the extent it cracks a dental crown.

548
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,520
 - I don't think he was shoving his microphone

549
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,040
 into his mouth.

550
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,720
 I think it's probably more of an accidental kind of

551
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,800
 swinging it around that it hits you in the face.

552
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,120
 I don't think he was deep-throating the microphone.

553
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,360
 - No, no, if you watch concerts, that was his style.

554
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,840
 He sang from the back of the throat

555
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,680
 and he took that literally.

556
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,720
 So he would throw it all the way back.

557
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,680
 (laughing)

558
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,680
 Hey, just, I was looking into,

559
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,560
 'cause this gold tooth is a relic.

560
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,080
 And I was just looking at other political leader relics

561
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,640
 that we still have.

562
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,720
 And have you guys heard of Chairman Mao's mango?

563
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,560
 - No.

564
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,000
 - Is it like Elizabeth Brown in Spanish?

565
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,360
 - This was basically during the Cultural Revolution,

566
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,840
 there was a big fight that happened

567
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,480
 when one of the universities in Beijing,

568
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,600
 Tsinghua University, and Mao sent 30,000 workers

569
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,280
 to try and stop all of the sort of weird groups

570
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
 that were breaking out and causing ruckus

571
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,920
 in China at the time, sent these workers to stop that.

572
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,360
 And there was a huge fight there.

573
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,080
 The workers were not prepared for the fight

574
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,480
 'cause they basically came with just pictures

575
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,760
 of Chairman Mao, a little red book,

576
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,280
 whereas the other people had like bricks and spears and acid.

577
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,920
 And so it was a huge fight.

578
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,360
 And eventually these workers won.

579
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,200
 And as a reward, Chairman Mao gave them 40 mangoes.

580
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,480
 Mao never gave presents.

581
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,600
 And so it was seen as a high, high honor.

582
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,520
 But the main thing was that no one in Northern China

583
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,800
 at this point really knew what mangoes were.

584
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,200
 So all of them were just staying up at night,

585
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
 looking at it, smelling them, caressing them.

586
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,440
 And they were thinking we need to make sure

587
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,160
 that this mango, this special thing

588
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,800
 that he's given to us remains with us.

589
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,400
 And so they had it waxed and they put it in from aldehyde

590
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,920
 and they made sure that it just stayed proper.

591
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,800
 And as a result, it got taken everywhere

592
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,320
 and everyone was looking at Chairman Mao's mango.

593
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,360
 The Communist Party seeing this

594
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,720
 turned it into a propaganda thing.

595
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,000
 So there was merchandise that you could buy.

596
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,440
 Everywhere you went, there were like tin cups

597
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,160
 with mangoes on them and so on.

598
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,680
 And it became this massive thing, the Chairman Mao mango.

599
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,920
 - Doesn't it slightly go against the principles

600
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,120
 held within the little red book

601
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,680
 to turn your mango into merchandise?

602
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,400
 - How does Mao feel about that?

603
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,640
 - I don't think it's that granular on the detail.

604
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,960
 - Yeah.

605
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,160
 - The little red book.

606
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,480
 It probably does go against the principles,

607
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,640
 but there's a loophole I'm sure.

608
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,240
 - Okay, it's the mango loophole.

609
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,360
 - Flog your mango around the place.

610
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,160
 - We talk about this on QI, I don't know if it ever went out,

611
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,680
 but the question that we asked was,

612
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,280
 how mad could a mango make a mango?

613
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,040
 - Ah, nice. - Very nice.

614
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,280
 - What was the answer to how?

615
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,160
 - How mad could a mango make a mango?

616
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,000
 - Well, the answer was the anecdote that you just told me.

617
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,040
 - Ah, was it?

618
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,880
 That went out on QI, didn't it?

619
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,000
 - I don't know if it was really with a format of QI, Dan,

620
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,960
 but often there's not just like one straight answer.

621
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,880
 It's sometimes a bit of a left field thing.

622
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,200
 - I, yeah, I should start watching that show.

623
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,800
 (laughing)

624
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,800
 - There's one piece of material

625
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,120
 that's lasted a very long time,

626
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,040
 which probably you'll all be familiar with.

627
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,880
 - Oh yeah.

628
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,320
 - And that is the Virgin Mary toast.

629
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,840
 So can everyone, can you remember the toast,

630
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,920
 the famous toast with the face of the Virgin Mary?

631
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,760
 - Yeah, okay, it's what it sounds like.

632
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,200
 Yeah, it was sort of, I think it was a big hit.

633
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,720
 It was like the biggest celebrity of the '90s,

634
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,640
 along with the Spice Girls.

635
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,640
 1996, this woman was eating toast, Diana Doyser,

636
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,200
 and she took a tiny bite of her toast

637
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,480
 and then realized the Virgin Mary's face

638
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,560
 was staring up at her.

639
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,560
 And so she preserved it in between two bits of hard plastic.

640
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,880
 - She should have preserved it between two pieces of cheese.

641
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,920
 That would have made it an anti-sandwich

642
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,040
 and would have made it worth even more.

643
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,320
 You could have put it in between two slices of bread

644
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,240
 and had like a toast sandwich,

645
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,000
 which is something that you can eat, isn't it?

646
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,240
 - Yes, absolutely.

647
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,160
 A club sandwich is kind of like that, isn't it?

648
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,520
 - Yeah, I feel like we're not going

649
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,240
 to the point of Anna's story here.

650
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,040
 - I'm not sure there is a point to this story,

651
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,960
 but let's hear it out.

652
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,000
 Apparently she was as big as the Spice Girls.

653
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,320
 I look forward to hearing about the reunion tour

654
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,520
 and her getting her own movie.

655
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,320
 - Well, you may be surprised.

656
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,600
 So none of your solutions afforded the Virgin Mary

657
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,640
 the kind of respect that Diana wanted to,

658
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,600
 'cause she's a devout Christian.

659
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,360
 So she preserved it and she said,

660
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,880
 she had like 10 years of good luck.

661
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,360
 She won $70,000 in a casino because of this toast.

662
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,920
 And then it was picked up by--

663
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,120
 - Is there more detail on that or not?

664
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,440
 - Yeah, whispered over her ear.

665
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,760
 - Put it all on bread.

666
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,800
 (all laughing)

667
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,120
 - Put it all on bread.

668
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,700
 (all laughing)

669
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,680
 - She kept a piece of toast,

670
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,000
 thinking this will bring me luck.

671
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,640
 And then in the next decade, she won 70 grand.

672
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,040
 If you don't think that's 'cause of the toast,

673
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,280
 then that's your problem.

674
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,000
 - Sure, it's just a way to wear the crust.

675
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,840
 - Oh my God.

676
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,160
 (all laughing)

677
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,720
 - Anyway, it's now held by another casino,

678
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,520
 GoldenPalace.com,

679
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,600
 which is a casino known for collecting

680
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,200
 these strange modern day relics.

681
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,880
 And they bought it for $28,000.

682
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,920
 - Oh, wow.

683
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,560
 Is that why the house always wins?

684
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,480
 Because they've got the ultimate sort of talisman there.

685
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,320
 - Yes, exactly.

686
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,520
 That is very lucky.

687
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,920
 - As they said, when they bought it off her,

688
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,640
 our customers are really gonna get a kick

689
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,480
 out of seeing this sandwich.

690
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,920
 And they actually paid for her to go on tour with it

691
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,760
 and to the Taj Mahal and to Red Square.

692
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,100
 - The Taj Mahal.

693
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,440
 - To the Eiffel Tower.

694
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,920
 (all laughing)

695
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,760
 - Wow.

696
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,960
 - It was very nice for Diana,

697
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,080
 who said she'd never been on holiday in her life.

698
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,080
 She'd spent her life looking after her elderly parents.

699
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,720
 She got to do this world tour.

700
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,840
 - She must have had a real,

701
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,920
 wry smile on her face as she got off the plane.

702
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,000
 - Oh yeah, 'cause that's the type of bread, isn't it?

703
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,080
 - Absolutely.

704
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,360
 Maybe it was a whole grin.

705
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,120
 (all laughing)

706
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,320
 There's another toothy relic that I found.

707
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,760
 Actually, it's more of just a wonderful tooth removal

708
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,600
 than a relic.

709
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,920
 I don't know if the tooth has been preserved.

710
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,560
 But it was from 2015.

711
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,360
 And it was a young girl called Ellie Clay.

712
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,440
 And she had her tooth removed by javelin.

713
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,560
 So someone stood 100 meters away and threw a javelin

714
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,800
 and it just lunded directly in her face

715
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,880
 while the tooth was.

716
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,120
 - That would have been very impressive.

717
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,760
 They did it in reverse, the health and safety nuts.

718
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,400
 Her father was an Olympic javelin thrower

719
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,160
 and she had a very loose tooth.

720
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,040
 And so they tied a bit of dental floss

721
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,160
 carefully around the tooth.

722
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,520
 They tied the dental floss to a javelin,

723
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,480
 I guess a very long bit of dental floss.

724
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,080
 And then he just chucked the javelin 30 meters.

725
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,760
 They made sure it was a really loose tooth

726
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,160
 before they did it, obviously.

727
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,720
 So she didn't go flying after it.

728
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,680
 - And her whole family have these crazy methods

729
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,600
 of removing teeth.

730
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,800
 They've done it by putting a bit of floss

731
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,960
 on the family dog's collar

732
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,360
 and then getting the dog to run off.

733
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,400
 That's one thing I've tried.

734
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,000
 Lots of stuff.

735
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,520
 - That actually wasn't a removal attempt.

736
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,320
 The dog was just stolen midway through a wall, wasn't it?

737
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,900
 (upbeat music)

738
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:10,760
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

739
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,400
 And that is Anna.

740
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,880
 - My fact this week is that in the 1920s,

741
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,640
 thousands of people with the surname Drake

742
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,680
 fought a legal battle to inherit

743
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,000
 Sir Francis Drake's fortune.

744
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,840
 - Wow.

745
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,320
 - This is just an amazing scam that was pulled.

746
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,680
 And it was based on a rumor

747
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,600
 that's basically been going around since Francis Drake died.

748
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,440
 And he didn't really have any direct descendants

749
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,680
 and everyone claimed that he had hidden fortune

750
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,960
 that wasn't inherited by anyone and that's sitting somewhere.

751
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,720
 And fast forward to 1914.

752
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,440
 It starts with these con artists.

753
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,200
 There's a woman called Sadie Whitaker

754
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,080
 and she's going around Iowa claiming her cousin's heir

755
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,640
 to this ancient Drake fortune,

756
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,640
 which is now just worth so much

757
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,040
 because it's gained so much interest over the last 300 years.

758
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,160
 And she swindles this Iowa farm woman out of $6,000

759
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,320
 'cause she convinces her that if she buys shares

760
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,760
 in this schemed kind of retrieve Francis Drake's lost wealth,

761
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,400
 then she'll get a cut in it.

762
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,880
 Now this woman's son, this poor farm woman's son,

763
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,760
 is a guy called Oscar Hartzell,

764
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,000
 who rather than going to defend his mother's honor and money,

765
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,120
 thinks, what a good trick, I'm gonna build on that.

766
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,960
 And he joins up with them

767
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,800
 and Oscar Hartzell sets up the Francis Drake Association.

768
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,280
 He writes to thousands of people across the state

769
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,280
 that are cross America with the name Drake saying,

770
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,000
 Francis Drake's fortune is being held

771
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,160
 by the British government, those bastards.

772
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,320
 We've got to wrench it back.

773
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
 You're probably all related to him.

774
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,440
 You pay me some money and I'll go and get it for you.

775
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,280
 - It's so convincing. - Yeah.

776
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,760
 It's so convincing that I feel like I want to sign up to it

777
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,920
 despite not being called Drake and state.

778
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,760
 - Well, it doesn't matter.

779
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,080
 It doesn't matter that you're not called Drake.

780
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,000
 This was his genius.

781
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,640
 He had 70,000 people signed up,

782
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,360
 including people not called Drake.

783
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,520
 He just opened it up.

784
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,360
 Everyone, get in, get in.

785
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,200
 - He expanded.

786
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,880
 He suddenly went, hang on, people really are idiots.

787
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,160
 I'm gonna make this a bit bigger.

788
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,360
 - Who got the money in the end?

789
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,960
 Was it the rapper or?

790
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,440
 - That's where it is.

791
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,040
 - You can spend as much time rapping now.

792
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,680
 It's certainly not through album sales.

793
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,920
 I'll tell you that much.

794
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,760
 That's unfair.

795
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,080
 I'm sure he sells very well.

796
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,320
 (laughing)

797
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,200
 - That is the most handy thing I've ever heard

798
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,400
 in my entire life.

799
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,480
 - Oh, I'm sure.

800
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,360
 Young Drake, I'm sure he does very well for himself.

801
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,200
 - Mr. Drake.

802
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,120
 So there's no money, is there?

803
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,960
 - No.

804
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,480
 - A complete nest of lies from the top to the finish, yeah.

805
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,160
 - Once someone dies, if they have a will,

806
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,320
 after 30 years, if you don't sort it out,

807
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,640
 then it all goes to the crown.

808
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
 So there wouldn't be any money anyway,

809
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,720
 even if there was some money.

810
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,120
 But I think in the end, it went to his wife

811
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,440
 or his brother or something.

812
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,800
 Like, they know where it went.

813
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,200
 - Yeah, it went to a nephew or something of his in the end.

814
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,800
 There was nothing very exciting about it.

815
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,640
 But everyone was so convinced

816
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,880
 that this guy was telling the truth,

817
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,680
 that the FBI actually investigated

818
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,840
 what had happened to Francis Drake's money

819
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
 in the late 1500s.

820
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,600
 - It's just brilliant.

821
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,160
 - And like you say, it concluded it had gone to his wife

822
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,560
 and then down to some of his descendants.

823
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,080
 But the details, the details were so convincing

824
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,440
 because he said it was worth about a hundred billion pounds.

825
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,960
 I'm not sure whether that's in modern money

826
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,080
 or in 1930s money,

827
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,160
 'cause that would presumably have bought America.

828
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,160
 But one of the things he said was the entire city of Plymouth,

829
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,280
 that happens to be part of the Drake estate.

830
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,120
 So...

831
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,600
 - Yeah, he said, I think he went up

832
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,400
 to 400 billion at one stage,

833
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,200
 'cause he kind of just said different amounts all the time.

834
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,940
 And he said that as soon as he got the money,

835
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,400
 obviously everyone would get the bit that they asked for.

836
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,760
 They would get a return on their money.

837
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,920
 But he said that he was gonna go back to America

838
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,640
 and he was gonna buy up,

839
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,360
 I think Missouri and the IOR and a few other states

840
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,920
 and he was gonna put a big fence around them

841
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,000
 and just live in them, that's what he claimed.

842
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,600
 - His powers of persuasion just sound extraordinary.

843
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,080
 'Cause once he got back to America,

844
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,740
 he was taken to trial in 1933.

845
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,080
 And yet, even though he was being held accountable for it,

846
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,600
 he still managed to get people

847
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,200
 who were subscribing to this scheme

848
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,760
 to contribute $350,000 in legal defense fund

849
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
 to make sure he didn't go to jail.

850
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,720
 He did go to jail.

851
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,400
 He got given a 10-year sentence.

852
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,680
 And even then, still, his agents were able to claw

853
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,920
 another half million dollars from these subscribers

854
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,640
 to make sure that he was doing okay.

855
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,720
 - It is, I mean, it's kind of because it was presented

856
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,800
 as an investment.

857
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,400
 People were told, this is an investment

858
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,840
 to fund the legal case, to fight the British government

859
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,080
 and get this money out of them, which we know is there.

860
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,120
 And if you invest $1 for every dollar you will invest,

861
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,080
 you will get 500 back.

862
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,040
 That was the idea.

863
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,880
 And so when you put it like that,

864
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,320
 it starts to sound like, oh, well, I am spending now,

865
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,000
 but it's an investment, you know?

866
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,840
 - Yeah.

867
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,040
 And also, it sort of makes sense.

868
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,640
 Given what we know these days

869
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,840
 about how irrationally people can act,

870
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,280
 it makes sense that it actually convinced people even more

871
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,240
 when he was convicted that what he'd said was true,

872
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,680
 because it was like, well, why has the British government

873
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,000
 turned against him like this?

874
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Why have they put him in prison?

875
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,200
 He's obviously onto them.

876
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,040
 - They want to keep Plymouth.

877
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,880
 - You know, the same way that--

878
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,880
 - They're desperate to cling on to the beauties of Plymouth

879
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,920
 and they will not let it go.

880
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,760
 - Exactly.

881
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,600
 But it's just like today when you get someone like Alex Jones

882
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,840
 or a conspiracy theorist, right?

883
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,560
 And then people jump down their throats.

884
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,520
 And then that makes their supporters,

885
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,040
 their knee-jerk reaction is to dig down even harder

886
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,280
 and say, well, he's definitely telling the truth.

887
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,320
 - Yes, yeah.

888
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,080
 So Francis Drake?

889
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,920
 - Yeah.

890
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,400
 - Who, we haven't really said who he is yet,

891
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,640
 just for the benefit of any listeners

892
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,440
 who are not up on their Drake.

893
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,440
 He was a pirate, privateer,

894
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,840
 all-round coastal bandit,

895
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,480
 mayor of Plymouth, briefly.

896
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,520
 - British hero or pirates, would you say?

897
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,160
 - British hero, slave trader.

898
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,320
 It's so hard to tell where one begins on the other end.

899
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,400
 - Most likely known.

900
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,000
 He was the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe.

901
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,840
 - Yes.

902
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,440
 - Is possibly what he's most known for.

903
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,920
 - Or possibly most well-known for the Spanish Armada

904
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,400
 being the supposed head of--

905
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,560
 - Yes.

906
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,680
 - No, he wasn't the head of the Spanish Armada.

907
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,720
 He was the opposite of that.

908
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,560
 - He was the opposite of that.

909
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,400
 - Quite the reverse, yeah, yeah.

910
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,880
 He was the tail of the Spanish Armada.

911
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,320
 He supposedly was the head of the force that defeated it, yeah.

912
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,480
 Yeah, I mean, like a really mixed career,

913
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,920
 did start out as a slave trader

914
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,680
 and then became a great English hero.

915
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,840
 So, you know, definitely a mixed scorecard, I would say.

916
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,600
 - An English hero for the time,

917
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,080
 which basically meant he stole shed loads of money

918
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,200
 off other countries and handed it to Queen Elizabeth,

919
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,240
 which, you know, that's how you wanna make a penny.

920
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,160
 - That was the benchmark in those days for English hero.

921
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,320
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

922
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,560
 He seems like a very difficult man to get along with.

923
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,200
 On one of his voyages,

924
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,200
 he accused his second in command of witchcraft

925
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,920
 and had a show trial and then had his head chopped off.

926
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,760
 - Wow.

927
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,600
 - Yeah.

928
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,440
 - Doughty.

929
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,560
 - Thomas Doughty.

930
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,040
 Not Doughty enough to resist having his head chopped off,

931
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,880
 I don't know.

932
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,560
 - Well, I doubt he thought much of that trial.

933
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,160
 - Oh boy.

934
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,560
 I doubt he would like to hear us talking about him

935
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,400
 in this way.

936
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,120
 (laughing)

937
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,880
 - He had a sense of humor, actually, Thomas Doughty.

938
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,080
 So perhaps he would have loved this.

939
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,160
 Yeah, he allegedly, once he was told

940
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,560
 that he was gonna be beheaded by Drake,

941
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,200
 basically unfairly for bitching about Drake behind his back.

942
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,320
 He said, "Can I take communion with you first?"

943
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,480
 And then according to accounts that were pro and anti Drake,

944
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,320
 they both took communion together

945
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,840
 and then had a great laugh and a banter and a chat

946
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,960
 about the good old days when they were friends.

947
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,640
 And then Drake chopped his head off.

948
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,000
 And in fact, Drake offered him,

949
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,160
 and now this is according to Drake's nephew

950
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,060
 who wrote an account,

951
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,320
 which was based on diaries of people at the time.

952
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,240
 But apparently Drake said,

953
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,160
 "Look, 'cause I feel bad about this whole unjustly

954
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,320
 beheading you thing.

955
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,640
 Do you want me to shoot you instead?

956
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,120
 Because then you will have been shot by a gentleman."

957
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,280
 And that's nicer, isn't it?

958
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,120
 - Wow.

959
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,960
 - And Doughty said,

960
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,360
 "Thanks, that's so sweet of you to offer,

961
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,040
 but I'll just go for the straight up beheading."

962
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,880
 - Right.

963
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,640
 - It's quite a weird incident,

964
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,760
 but it's hard to tell, isn't it?

965
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,920
 'Cause there are so many pro-Drake and anti-Drake

966
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,480
 but it's a propaganda over the last 300 years.

967
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,120
 You don't know if it was a goody or a bady to work for.

968
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
 - Yeah.

969
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,560
 Well, there was one bad thing.

970
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,760
 When they went round the world,

971
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,120
 second navigator of the world,

972
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,920
 and they took a woman from El Salvador

973
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,880
 and she got pregnant and they dumped her on an island.

974
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,400
 And then what you're saying about propaganda,

975
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,160
 a few years later, Shakespeare wrote "The Tempest"

976
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,520
 and there is a character, Sycorax,

977
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,720
 who is an African woman who is dumped on an island,

978
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,000
 I think got pregnant.

979
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,240
 And there is an idea suggested, probably true,

980
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,880
 that Shakespeare based that on this woman, Mariah.

981
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,200
 - Oh, wow.

982
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,640
 - That is interesting.

983
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,440
 - That's so interesting about the idea

984
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,000
 that there was superstitions and witchcraft

985
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,960
 that you were mentioning in relation to Doughty

986
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,320
 because Drake was the kind of guy

987
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,320
 who other Spanish mariners would create these tales about

988
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,760
 as if he did have these amazing abilities.

989
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,720
 There was all these rumors that went around him.

990
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,840
 There was the rumor that he possessed a magic mirror

991
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,880
 that allowed him to spy on the locations

992
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,480
 of the ships on the sea.

993
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,360
 They just thought, how could he know where our ships were?

994
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,840
 - If they were behind him, for instance,

995
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,680
 he'd be able to spy on them.

996
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,520
 - Exactly.

997
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,560
 They thought he had sort of contact with witches from Devon

998
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,520
 and that he could raise storms against the Spanish Armada.

999
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,480
 Just so many of these weird tales.

1000
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,480
 There was a tale that Elizabeth Sydenham,

1001
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,080
 who he was in love with

1002
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,600
 and she wanted to marry him,

1003
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,680
 but the family said that this was not going to happen.

1004
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,880
 And then he went off and she got bored.

1005
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,000
 She was about to marry someone.

1006
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,960
 On the day that she was meant to marry him,

1007
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,200
 a huge cannonball fell at her feet

1008
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,600
 that had been fired from Drake's cannon

1009
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,400
 from across the world in order to stop the wedding.

1010
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,000
 That was a story that went around.

1011
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,480
 - Actually, Drake was just trying to remove a tooth, wasn't he?

1012
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,560
 (laughing)

1013
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,000
 That's completely misinterpreted.

1014
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,720
 - Imagine that if you say that line in the wedding,

1015
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,920
 does anyone here have any reason?

1016
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,440
 And everyone's sort of sniggering behind their hands.

1017
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,920
 So I wonder if someone will say something

1018
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,680
 that a massive cannonball lands in the middle of the church.

1019
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,320
 - Yeah, she did later marry Drake.

1020
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,160
 They did get married.

1021
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,640
 But yeah, that was one of the stories.

1022
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,880
 He was full of all these abilities.

1023
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,400
 - I've just got one more thing,

1024
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,400
 which is another 1930s Francis Drake-based swindle.

1025
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,120
 This was the story of a young man

1026
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,720
 who went for a hike in San Francisco Bay in 1936,

1027
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,080
 and he found a metal plate on the ground.

1028
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,920
 He didn't think much of it,

1029
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,760
 but his friends pointed out,

1030
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,280
 "It appeared to say Francis Drake on it."

1031
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,200
 And so he said, "All right, I'll get it checked out."

1032
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,320
 He took it to a professor at the University of California

1033
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,160
 called Herbert Bolton,

1034
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,680
 who was a world expert on the history of the Americas.

1035
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,880
 And when Bolton saw this plate,

1036
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,240
 he became unbelievably excited.

1037
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,920
 He said, "This is the Drake plate."

1038
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,120
 It proves that he arrived in California.

1039
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,680
 There was a story that Drake, when he reached California,

1040
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,760
 he left a brass plate there with some writing on,

1041
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,000
 "And this looked like it."

1042
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,400
 Nearly 400 years later,

1043
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,400
 this is a seminal piece of the history of the world.

1044
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,080
 This proves something incredible.

1045
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,480
 The spelling looked legit.

1046
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,160
 The language on it looked legit.

1047
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,560
 And this was announced with great brouhaha.

1048
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,760
 There was some people who doubted it,

1049
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,800
 but it was announced as being real.

1050
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,920
 And then in 1977, there was a celebration of 400 years

1051
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,880
 since Drake had reached California,

1052
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,480
 and it was tested, and it was so, so clearly a fake.

1053
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,480
 There was way too much zinc.

1054
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,280
 It had been cut around the edges by a metal saw,

1055
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,680
 which hadn't existed at the time.

1056
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,040
 And the awful thing was,

1057
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,680
 Herbert Bolton, the professor, had students

1058
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,800
 who knew how interested he was in this subject.

1059
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,040
 They had made a fake plate,

1060
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,880
 and they had left it for someone to find.

1061
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,800
 He had found it, and he spent the rest of his life

1062
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,640
 believing in it.

1063
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,680
 And the problem was he had gone public so quickly,

1064
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,920
 and he had got so excited

1065
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,920
 that his students were too embarrassed to say,

1066
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,800
 "It's not real, we fake the whole thing."

1067
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,040
 So he went to his grave believing in the plate.

1068
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
 - Oh, well, that's all right.

1069
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,320
 - And then he went to his grave.

1070
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,160
 (laughing)

1071
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,000
 - That's fine.

1072
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,480
 - I guess you're right, yeah, yeah.

1073
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,040
 - That plate is really interesting,

1074
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,280
 or the idea that Drake sort of claimed

1075
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,880
 that part of California for England,

1076
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,680
 and said, "Okay, this land mass is now ours."

1077
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,920
 When, of course, the Spanish were kind of working

1078
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,880
 their way up through Mexico and through that side.

1079
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,960
 The Spanish were really, really annoyed about this.

1080
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,440
 But the lucky thing was that they ran

1081
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,680
 all of the map makers,

1082
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,400
 or rather, the map makers were mostly in, like,

1083
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,000
 Netherlands and Belgium and stuff,

1084
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,160
 but they were in charge of that area.

1085
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,880
 And so they got all the map makers to pretend

1086
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,080
 that California was an island.

1087
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,360
 And you know, you see those old maps

1088
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,720
 where California was an island?

1089
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,960
 Well, that was the Spanish basically saying,

1090
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,240
 "This thing that Francis Drake has claimed for England

1091
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,680
 "is not the whole of America,

1092
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,280
 "it's just a little kind of island on the side."

1093
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,120
 - Right.

1094
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,520
 - So technically, if California is English property,

1095
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,680
 but Plymouth belongs to the States,

1096
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,320
 should we just have an exchange now

1097
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,880
 and keep things the same?

1098
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,560
 - I think no one can argue with that,

1099
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,400
 can they?

1100
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,800
 If we get California and they get Plymouth.

1101
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,040
 - It's a win-win, guys.

1102
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,620
 (upbeat music)

1103
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:53,520
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1104
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,800
 and that is my fact.

1105
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,200
 My fact this week is that 20th century

1106
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,040
 American science fiction works include the titles

1107
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,440
 "Servants of the Wank" and "Planet of the Knobheads."

1108
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,360
 - Oh, aren't we all, in a way, "Servants of the Wank"?

1109
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,720
 (both laughing)

1110
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,280
 - So these were legit books that were published.

1111
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,720
 "Planet of the Knobheads" published in 1939

1112
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,160
 by Stanton A. Koblenz,

1113
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,480
 and in 1969, "Servants of the Wank" was published,

1114
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,920
 and that was by Jack Vance.

1115
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,160
 - I think British readers might not recognize

1116
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,320
 "Servants of the Wank"

1117
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,440
 'cause it got renamed in Britain

1118
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,040
 because for obvious reasons, yeah.

1119
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,280
 - Well, it's not spelled the same.

1120
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,480
 I mean, I'm not convinced we're pronouncing it right.

1121
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,400
 Very clearly to me, it looks like "Servants of the Wank."

1122
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,240
 - The wanker?

1123
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,400
 (both laughing)

1124
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,480
 - That's just not funny.

1125
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,120
 - It is, it's spelled W-A-N-K-H.

1126
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,120
 I would say it's wank, like with like, lock, like lock.

1127
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,560
 - Yeah, wank, wank.

1128
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,400
 - I don't know, Anna.

1129
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,960
 For someone who humorously mispronounced

1130
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,560
 the perfectly ordinary name, Pusy,

1131
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,880
 as pussy for comic effect, I don't think

1132
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,880
 you're gonna like to stand on.

1133
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,280
 - Did you read the, did you read the synopsis

1134
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,560
 of any of these "Servants of the Wank" down, for instance?

1135
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,840
 - I did, give it to us, it's brilliant.

1136
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,640
 - A couple of humans land on a planet

1137
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,720
 and there's loads of different groups there.

1138
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,800
 One of them are the wank.

1139
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,320
 Basically, there's a group called the wank men.

1140
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,600
 And the wank men are the "Servants of the Wank"

1141
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,880
 that the humans who are working under the wank.

1142
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,000
 - Well, it's Adam Wreath, isn't it?

1143
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,280
 It's this guy who crashes onto the planet

1144
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,480
 and he needs to get off, so his ship doesn't work.

1145
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
 So he needs to steal the wank spaceship

1146
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,320
 in order to get out of there, is the main plot.

1147
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,680
 - Well, yeah, but then you've got all these four groups

1148
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,280
 who are fighting against each other

1149
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,560
 and you've got the wank men who, it turns out,

1150
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,640
 have been destroying anything that the wank

1151
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,800
 have been making to try and make a war

1152
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,200
 between the wank and another group called the deer deer.

1153
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,760
 And when the wank find out that the wank men

1154
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,920
 have been destroying all of their wank machines,

1155
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,240
 then they expel the wank men from the wank cities.

1156
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,240
 And this guy who Dan's talking about gets to leave

1157
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,280
 on his spaceship.

1158
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,120
 - Yeah.

1159
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,540
 - It's a happy ending, you might say.

1160
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,200
 (laughing)

1161
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
 - Are you all right, Andy?

1162
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,040
 - I'm all right.

1163
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,880
 Oh my God.

1164
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,400
 - We'll get for that as you were in.

1165
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,640
 (laughing)

1166
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,840
 - Look, for the listener,

1167
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,760
 Andy did actually just blow his nose with a tissue.

1168
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,120
 - The wank men, they serve the wank.

1169
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,880
 But yes, what is the wank?

1170
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,840
 - Well, the wank is a group of people and they're on war,

1171
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,360
 but the wank men want to keep the status quo

1172
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,560
 because they want to carry on the cushy lives

1173
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,460
 looking after the wank.

1174
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,280
 And so they're kind of causing mayhem.

1175
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,280
 But actually, when the wank find out about the wank men

1176
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,920
 destroying all their stuff, then they get expelled.

1177
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,080
 - And Adam doesn't seem to be the first human there

1178
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,360
 because there are other human wank men who are there.

1179
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,320
 They serve under the wank and they handle

1180
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,240
 all the communication between the wank masters

1181
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,920
 and the rest of the people who live on the planet.

1182
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,760
 - Yeah.

1183
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,600
 I feel like I've gone into like a Dungeons and Dragons

1184
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,160
 discussion group or something after hours

1185
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,960
 or like, you know, game of thrones, fan clubs, been off.

1186
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,960
 Are we gonna go through the whole plot of wankers

1187
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,400
 or whatever it's called?

1188
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,240
 - That was the plot.

1189
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,080
 That's the plot.

1190
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,920
 - That's it.

1191
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,760
 - Oh my God.

1192
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,280
 - He had to change the title in the end,

1193
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,280
 as James says, when it came to Britain

1194
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,360
 because I think they thought, Anna's probably right,

1195
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,000
 the H might be pronounced differently,

1196
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,840
 but why don't we not take any risks?

1197
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,520
 So they changed it to, I think,

1198
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,800
 what was another alien species on there

1199
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,920
 called the Chesh or the Chash.

1200
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,000
 And the wank were renamed the Wannick.

1201
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,640
 So W-A-N-N-E-K.

1202
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,720
 - Okay, okay.

1203
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,040
 - Imagine being the author, Jack Vance,

1204
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,760
 having to go back and just one by one change wank to Wannick.

1205
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,080
 - He must be able to control H or a control H

1206
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,520
 or a control G or whatever it is.

1207
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,880
 - Well, it's 1969.

1208
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,720
 We didn't have that.

1209
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,400
 - Isn't it funny that it's 69?

1210
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,640
 It's just a whole nother layer

1211
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,040
 that I hadn't realized until just then.

1212
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,400
 - Jack Vance, author of the wank,

1213
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
 was a really interesting guy.

1214
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,680
 He, yeah, he was a fascinating author.

1215
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,040
 He wrote sci-fi all his life

1216
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,840
 and amazing works of fantasy, huge great works,

1217
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,800
 pioneered the dying earth genre.

1218
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,680
 In fact, I think this work

1219
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,520
 was part of his Dying Earth series,

1220
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,720
 but Vance himself was an electrician at Pearl Harbor

1221
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,280
 when he was in the US Navy,

1222
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,320
 but he left, he was discharged with prejudice,

1223
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,480
 very bored of Navy life,

1224
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,560
 and he got home a week before Pearl Harbor,

1225
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,240
 Pearl Harbor before the bombings.

1226
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,920
 So he really luckily dodged that.

1227
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,280
 - Sorry, when you say he was discharged with prejudice,

1228
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,120
 what is that?

1229
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,680
 - So usually with prejudice means

1230
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,760
 that it's like a final legal decision

1231
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,480
 and you can't appeal it or anything like that.

1232
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,740
 So I guess probably it might be dishonorable discharge

1233
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,640
 with prejudice, which means that you're out

1234
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,480
 when you can't come back, I'm not sure.

1235
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,320
 - Got it, yeah.

1236
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,800
 - Ironically, for a man who wrote

1237
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,600
 a book called Servants of the Wank,

1238
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,440
 he left with a dishonorable discharge.

1239
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,280
 So...

1240
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,020
 (laughing)

1241
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:02,360
 But he, after the USA entered the war,

1242
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,520
 he got back into the Navy,

1243
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,040
 and this is the crazy thing.

1244
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,800
 He had very bad eyesight.

1245
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,240
 No jokes, please. - Ironically, again?

1246
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,520
 - No, no, no, no, no.

1247
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,000
 He got into the merchant Navy by memorizing an eye chart,

1248
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,640
 and that was how he got in, yeah.

1249
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,720
 - Yeah.

1250
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,840
 - But you don't know what eye chart

1251
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,040
 you're gonna get, do you?

1252
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,880
 Are they all the same?

1253
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,880
 - Must be, yeah.

1254
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,840
 - What?

1255
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,040
 You're kidding?

1256
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,800
 We could all just memorize the eye chart

1257
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,640
 and cheat the eye test.

1258
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,560
 - Why do you wanna do that?

1259
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,320
 - I think there are three or four eye charts now, Anna.

1260
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,920
 And also, yeah, absolutely don't cheat on your eye test.

1261
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,320
 It's not, there's not a pass mark for the eye test.

1262
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,280
 (laughing)

1263
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,320
 There's no reward for passing,

1264
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,440
 apart from a continued bad sight, if you cheat.

1265
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,640
 - I like to do well.

1266
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,720
 (laughing)

1267
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,920
 - So I thought I would see if the word Wank with KH

1268
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,800
 has found its way in literature any other times in history.

1269
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,080
 And so I went onto Google books to look for instances

1270
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,200
 of the word Wank with W-A-N-K-H.

1271
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,520
 And they only found two examples.

1272
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,520
 One is a book called "Penciled Frown" by James Gray,

1273
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,960
 which is a 1925 satire about the newspaper industry.

1274
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,480
 And I'll just give you a quote.

1275
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,840
 "One man made primitive sounds as he played his cards,

1276
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,480
 "expressive of complacent confidence in his strategies.

1277
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,160
 "Wank said the player,

1278
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,240
 "said the player in triumph.

1279
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,600
 "Wank, Wank, Wank, Wank and Wank.

1280
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,920
 "At each utterance, a card was flung on the table."

1281
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,160
 (laughing)

1282
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,720
 - Okay, what was this word?

1283
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,280
 Never used before or since.

1284
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,880
 - It's just an onomatopoeic word of, you know,

1285
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,520
 triumph, I think.

1286
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,560
 - Right, he's just trying to invent a new exclamation.

1287
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,600
 - Yeah, and the only other example

1288
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,880
 of the word Wank I can find in the whole of history

1289
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,960
 of literature, according to Google books,

1290
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,080
 is from a systematic and ecological study

1291
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,480
 of birds of New Guinea by Dylan Ripley.

1292
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,840
 And it's about the collared brush turkey.

1293
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,440
 It says this species was common on the Tami River

1294
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,280
 in heavy evergreen forest.

1295
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,000
 It's called Wank, Wank.

1296
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,120
 (laughing)

1297
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,200
 In an ascending scale was frequent morning and evening,

1298
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,720
 and presumably more common as egg laying was in progress.

1299
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,840
 So there you are.

1300
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,440
 - Wow, very cool.

1301
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,440
 And James Harkins' book club will return next month.

1302
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,680
 (laughing)

1303
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,040
 - So I found Planet of the Knobhead's a bit harder

1304
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,320
 to get sort of blurb on.

1305
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,360
 I only found a few bits.

1306
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,360
 Did you guys find any?

1307
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,480
 There was, the bit I saw was that it's the story

1308
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,760
 of newlyweds, Jack and Marjorie Wainwright,

1309
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,600
 who are big stars in the scientific world.

1310
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,760
 And then they get kidnapped by aliens.

1311
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,760
 They get taken to this Knobhead planet

1312
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,440
 and they meet high nobule.

1313
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,400
 And there's just a line that was put in there,

1314
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,520
 which I can't tell, someone was writing a blurb,

1315
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,440
 but then added this line.

1316
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,640
 I think it might be an extract.

1317
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,600
 It's a line that just says,

1318
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,960
 in about a week I had recovered

1319
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,800
 from most of the effects of the Knob operation.

1320
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,120
 So little hints as to what happens in the plot,

1321
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,480
 but not too sure.

1322
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,880
 - Did you read sort of like the digest?

1323
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,160
 Was this the blinkest digest about the Knobhead's you got?

1324
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,160
 - The word Knobhead originally meant

1325
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,600
 like the end of a cane or the end of a screw,

1326
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,080
 for instance, any kind of knobby bit on the end of it.

1327
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,760
 - Well, if you see the aliens in it,

1328
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,240
 they look very robotic

1329
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,080
 and they have giant knobs on their head.

1330
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,560
 And so, hence the Knobheads.

1331
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:26,560
 - So we talked about science fiction,

1332
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,720
 the origin of science fiction on our comic relief marathon,

1333
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,680
 but I don't think we've mentioned it here.

1334
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,800
 So Hugo Gernsback is the person

1335
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,400
 who coined the term science fiction.

1336
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,240
 He sort of thought of as the father of science fiction.

1337
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,480
 He founded a magazine in the 1920s, devoted to it.

1338
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,520
 It was called Amazing Stories.

1339
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,440
 And the Hugo's are the awards

1340
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,760
 that are named after him, science fiction awards.

1341
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,360
 In the early days, he referred to it as scientific fiction.

1342
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,960
 And then it became science fiction over the years.

1343
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,040
 But he hated the Hugo awards

1344
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,560
 because he thought that they didn't award science fiction.

1345
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,000
 So basically the first nine winners of the awards,

1346
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,120
 he said only one of them was a natural piece

1347
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,160
 of science fiction. - Really?

1348
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,520
 - All the rest were fantasy.

1349
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,920
 - Wow. - He was very strict

1350
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,760
 about what it was.

1351
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,040
 It has to be, it has to have three components.

1352
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,080
 It has to have charming romance.

1353
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,720
 It has to have thrilling adventure

1354
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,160
 and it has to have scientific facts.

1355
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,200
 - Wow, 'cause two of those things

1356
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,920
 have nothing to do with science fiction.

1357
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,360
 - And not according to Hugo,

1358
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,000
 the creator of sci-fi, I'm afraid.

1359
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,520
 - Yeah, but it sounds like he didn't know

1360
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,000
 what it was nine times in a row.

1361
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,640
 So I think I'm on the side of the award organizers.

1362
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,840
 - To be fair to him, I think he was on your side, Dan,

1363
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,680
 and he said these don't contain enough scientific facts.

1364
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,360
 So he wanted them to be educational.

1365
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,840
 Like 25% of each science fiction book

1366
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,000
 should be educational.

1367
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,840
 - That's a high bar to clear.

1368
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,920
 25%? - Yes.

1369
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,560
 - Hey, you know, so famous science fiction writers,

1370
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,360
 Isaac Asimov has to be right up there in the top five, really.

1371
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,600
 And he's famous for the three laws of robotics.

1372
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,760
 But do you guys know how many actual laws there are

1373
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,520
 in the three laws of robotics?

1374
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,600
 - Well, I've read those books, iRobot books, right?

1375
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,000
 And I thought it was like, first one is,

1376
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,360
 they can't do any harm.

1377
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,560
 And the second one is something like,

1378
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,760
 unless there's danger is gonna happen to a human,

1379
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,640
 then they can do some harm or something.

1380
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,560
 And I can't remember what the third one was.

1381
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,400
 - Yeah, exactly.

1382
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,400
 A robot may not injure a human being.

1383
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,240
 Is the first one, there's more to that.

1384
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,280
 A robot must obey the orders given by human beings,

1385
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,440
 except when such orders would conflict with the first law.

1386
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,280
 And then the third law, a robot must protect

1387
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,480
 its own existence as long as such protection

1388
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,160
 does not conflict with the first or second law.

1389
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,600
 - So those were the three and he revised them a few times.

1390
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,080
 - Sorry, can I just ask, are these the three laws

1391
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,840
 within a piece of fiction?

1392
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,680
 What's the laws, where are they applying?

1393
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,240
 - Basically, he wrote all these stories

1394
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,600
 that basically use those three laws as your trick.

1395
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,320
 And every single one of the stories

1396
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,240
 has uses those as a trick, don't they, I think?

1397
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,720
 - Yes, yeah, exactly.

1398
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,440
 He just created the sort of the rules of sci-fi

1399
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,480
 for robots with this.

1400
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,360
 So he revised them a number of times during his lifetime,

1401
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,360
 but then he decided to add another law.

1402
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,760
 But obviously, very annoying to have to rewrite

1403
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,000
 and call it the four laws of robotics.

1404
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,160
 So he managed to do it.

1405
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,600
 He added the fourth law in by going backwards.

1406
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,720
 So there's a zero-

1407
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,640
 - Oh, that's, yeah, that's standard, I think.

1408
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,520
 Like there's a zero-floor of thermodynamics as well

1409
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,440
 inside, so a few things like that, yeah.

1410
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,720
 - That's the equivalent of going back

1411
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,520
 and changing Wank to Wanek all the way through, isn't it?

1412
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,240
 - Yes, yeah, exactly.

1413
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,840
 So there's actually four laws in the three laws of robotics

1414
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,640
 and that fourth one is a robot may not harm humanity

1415
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,160
 or by an action allow humanity to come to harm.

1416
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,840
 - A high bar to clear.

1417
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,400
 - I read about the first ever sci-fi convention.

1418
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,480
 - Oh, yes, yeah.

1419
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,000
 - This was a fundraiser by a man called Dr. Herbert Tippitz

1420
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,520
 who was the founder of London's West End Hospital

1421
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,240
 and School of Massage and Electricity.

1422
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,720
 And he'd read this book by Edward Bulllitton

1423
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,280
 called "Real the Power of the Coming Race."

1424
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,320
 And he thought, "What a great idea.

1425
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,240
 "I will set up a little convention

1426
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:05,240
 "where people can dress up as characters from this book

1427
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,920
 "and it'll make us a load of money for my hospital."

1428
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,080
 And so he did.

1429
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,680
 He spent an absolute ton of money setting it up.

1430
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,040
 There was magic shows, it was kind of

1431
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,720
 like an Egyptian style bit of sci-fi.

1432
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,480
 So everyone dressed in all these Egyptian garbs,

1433
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,240
 sometimes in ancient Greek clothing.

1434
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,440
 Everyone got these little glasses of bovril

1435
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,440
 because there was a magic fluid called Vril in this book.

1436
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,480
 And the company that was making beef extract drinks

1437
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,080
 decided to rebrand and call themselves bovril

1438
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,160
 in honor of this amazing book.

1439
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,920
 People could go along, there was a demon dog

1440
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,280
 who could read minds that you could go and see.

1441
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,120
 There was all sorts of stuff happening,

1442
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,960
 but then basically it didn't go according to plan.

1443
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,200
 There was a critic writing in the magazine Truth

1444
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,240
 who said, "A more humiliating display of witless

1445
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,760
 "and purell fantasticalities was never designed."

1446
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,600
 - Wow. - Yeah.

1447
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,920
 - And everyone basically hated it.

1448
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,760
 It was supposed to run for three days.

1449
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,280
 They actually ran for five days,

1450
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,720
 but not because everyone wanted to go,

1451
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,960
 it was just because so few people went

1452
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,960
 that they wanted to get one or two more people

1453
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,600
 through the door so they could make some of the money back.

1454
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,640
 And the guy lost 1,600 pounds

1455
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,680
 rather than making any money for his hospitals

1456
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,560
 and declared himself bankrupt.

1457
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,040
 - Wow. - Such a shame.

1458
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,200
 - That whole thing, it feels like it's an argument

1459
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,240
 for the fact that we never develop time travel

1460
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,320
 in our history because obviously time travelers

1461
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,960
 would all want to go to the first ever sci-fi convention

1462
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,480
 because that would be an amazing thing.

1463
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,800
 And that guy would have coined it in

1464
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,760
 if we ever invented time travel.

1465
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,720
 - That sounds like a really good kind of meta sci-fi story

1466
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,920
 to say of all the time travelers going back there.

1467
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,280
 - I think that's probably the real reason

1468
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,720
 they extended it for two days

1469
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,960
 because they think in the future

1470
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,720
 we're gonna have to up the capacity limit here

1471
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,160
 for when all the time travelers come back.

1472
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,840
 Yeah, and they had this whole thing,

1473
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,000
 they had an opening ceremony

1474
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,960
 where they had Prince Henry and Princess Beatrice

1475
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,720
 of Battenburg come and do the official opening

1476
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,640
 and they were accepting donations right from the get go

1477
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,480
 as soon as they announced the opening

1478
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,080
 where people who were representatives of organizations

1479
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,440
 would approach them and they would drop purses filled

1480
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,880
 with donations in front of them.

1481
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,640
 So it looked like, oh, the money's coming in,

1482
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,000
 this is a huge success.

1483
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,280
 And one of the things they discovered afterwards

1484
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,120
 when money was not being made

1485
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,400
 and all the things had gone wrong

1486
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,240
 is that the purses that were being dropped were all props

1487
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,360
 and there was nothing in there.

1488
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,360
 And so they didn't even have that to rely on, yeah.

1489
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,200
 - Come on, Battenburgs,

1490
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,460
 they should have just done a cake sale to you.

1491
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,720
 (laughing)

1492
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:41,920
 - Okay, that's it.

1493
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,080
 That is all of our facts.

1494
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,480
