00:00:02,00:00:04,"- Hi everybody, just before we start this week's show,"
00:00:04,00:00:07,we have an exciting announcement to make.
00:00:07,00:00:08,"- Yes, as you may have heard,"

00:00:21,00:00:24,"And in the first half, there's gonna be a magnificent"
00:00:24,00:00:26,"first half comedy set,"

00:00:50,00:00:52,"so many places we're going to, do check it out."
00:00:52,00:00:56,"Okay, go to qi.com/fishevents,"
00:00:56,00:00:58,"but before that, on with the show."
00:00:58,00:01:00,(upbeat music)
00:01:00,00:01:17,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:17,00:01:19,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:01:19,00:01:23,coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:01:23,00:01:25,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:25,00:01:27,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:01:27,00:01:29,"Anna Tyshinski, and James Harkin,"
00:01:29,00:01:32,"and once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:32,00:01:35,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:01:35,00:01:38,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:38,00:01:42,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:01:42,00:01:45,"My fact is that the Victorian poet, Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"
00:01:45,00:01:48,had her spaniel stolen by London's dog banditty
00:01:48,00:01:51,on three separate occasions.
00:01:51,00:01:55,- They sound like at least two euphemisms in that sentence.
00:01:55,00:01:57,I reckon having your spaniel stolen
00:01:57,00:01:59,and London's dog banditty sounds.
00:01:59,00:02:00,- It's all true.
00:02:00,00:02:02,"There might be some euphemisms later actually,"
00:02:02,00:02:04,"but no, that she had a lovely little spaniel"
00:02:04,00:02:08,"and it was called flush, flush the dog."
00:02:08,00:02:09,- But don't.
00:02:09,00:02:11,- Don't flush the dog.
00:02:11,00:02:11,- If you're listening.
00:02:11,00:02:15,- But this was a huge problem in Victorian London.
00:02:15,00:02:17,"I say huge, it was a medium-sized problem."
00:02:17,00:02:19,But for middle-class people who were suddenly getting dogs
00:02:19,00:02:22,"and showing them off and grooming them and breeding them,"
00:02:22,00:02:24,it was a problem because thieves realized
00:02:24,00:02:26,you could steal dogs and the owners
00:02:26,00:02:28,would pay quite a bit to get them back.
00:02:28,00:02:33,And poor little flush got stolen in 1843 to order.
00:02:33,00:02:35,She paid the thieves off and they brought it back.
00:02:35,00:02:38,"Then again in 1844, she paid them off again,"
00:02:38,00:02:40,"bit more money this time, she got it back."
00:02:40,00:02:44,"And then in 1846, a third time flush the dog was stolen."
00:02:44,00:02:45,"At which point, flush must have been"
00:02:45,00:02:47,getting used to this routine by now.
00:02:47,00:02:51,"- At that stage, maybe flush preferred his other owners."
00:02:51,00:02:55,"Although I heard that it was a very, very spoiled dog flush"
00:02:55,00:02:58,and that he would turn his nose up at any bread
00:02:58,00:02:59,that wasn't buttered.
00:02:59,00:03:02,So I imagine the dog that was probably
00:03:02,00:03:04,weren't giving him buttered bread.
00:03:04,00:03:06,"- She wrote about him, ""If you were but to see him"
00:03:06,00:03:09,"eat partridge from a silver fork."""
00:03:09,00:03:12,"I mean, very, very over-spoiled dog."
00:03:12,00:03:12,Anyway. - Then what?
00:03:12,00:03:14,What's the end of that clause?
00:03:14,00:03:17,"If you were but to see him eat partridge from a silver fork,"
00:03:17,00:03:19,"what, you pass out with envy?"
00:03:19,00:03:21,I think-- - You're so disgusted
00:03:21,00:03:22,you leave the room.
00:03:22,00:03:24,- I've cut it short there.
00:03:24,00:03:26,So we'll never know.
00:03:26,00:03:27,It can't have been that interesting.
00:03:27,00:03:28,"Otherwise I would have said,"
00:03:28,00:03:29,"if she'd said, ""If you were to see him do this,"
00:03:29,00:03:30,"you'd shit."""
00:03:30,00:03:33,(laughing)
00:03:33,00:03:34,"- That's her style, I believe it."
00:03:34,00:03:38,- She claimed that he could have the capacity for literacy.
00:03:38,00:03:40,She said he recognized the letters A and B
00:03:40,00:03:42,"and that maybe in the course of time,"
00:03:42,00:03:43,he might learn the full alphabet.
00:03:43,00:03:45,- Wow. - Then again then.
00:03:45,00:03:48,- So he could send an S-O-S out at some point.
00:03:48,00:03:51,"- No, he could order an ABBA CD, basically."
00:03:51,00:03:52,"- Anyway, well look, he couldn't have done"
00:03:52,00:03:54,"any of these things if, as the thieves threatened,"
00:03:54,00:03:57,they were going to cut off his head and paws
00:03:57,00:03:59,and send them back to Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
00:03:59,00:04:00,"Very distressing, obviously."
00:04:00,00:04:02,That's what they said they would do.
00:04:02,00:04:03,"- Yeah, that's horrible."
00:04:03,00:04:04,No wonder she paid up.
00:04:04,00:04:06,- I read a really good account of it
00:04:06,00:04:08,of the third time that the dog was stolen
00:04:08,00:04:10,and she was getting on a bus
00:04:10,00:04:13,"and the dog was just wandering behind her in London,"
00:04:13,00:04:14,clearly leachless.
00:04:14,00:04:15,"As she got on the bus, turned around,"
00:04:15,00:04:17,looked for the dog and it was gone.
00:04:17,00:04:20,"And instead of getting off to look for her dog,"
00:04:20,00:04:23,she and her sister just stayed on the bus
00:04:23,00:04:24,"and her sister was like,"
00:04:24,00:04:26,"""Well, guess there'll be a ransom note when we get back."""
00:04:26,00:04:29,(all laughing)
00:04:29,00:04:31,"- That's a great idea, isn't it?"
00:04:31,00:04:32,If you're in the supermarket
00:04:32,00:04:34,"and you can't be bothered taking your kids home in the car,"
00:04:34,00:04:36,just wait for the ransom note.
00:04:36,00:04:38,(all laughing)
00:04:38,00:04:41,- Can I ask what kind of bus we think she was getting?
00:04:41,00:04:42,"It was the 1840s, right?"
00:04:42,00:04:44,Was it like a stagecoach?
00:04:44,00:04:45,- It might have been a carriage.
00:04:45,00:04:46,- A carriage.
00:04:46,00:04:48,"- An omnibus, I reckon."
00:04:48,00:04:49,"- An omnibus, yeah."
00:04:49,00:04:50,- That's what it felt like.
00:04:50,00:04:52,It felt like she was getting on a proper bus
00:04:52,00:04:52,when I read the report.
00:04:52,00:04:54,"- I mean, it certainly wasn't a proper bus"
00:04:54,00:04:54,in the sense that we know it
00:04:54,00:04:57,because it was like six years before proper buses were seen.
00:04:57,00:04:59,- Was it a rootmaster?
00:04:59,00:05:00,"Yeah, maybe I've read that wrong."
00:05:00,00:05:01,Maybe carriage.
00:05:01,00:05:03,"Let's go carriage, actually."
00:05:03,00:05:04,(all laughing)
00:05:04,00:05:05,- Flushed the dog.
00:05:05,00:05:06,"He must have thought,"
00:05:06,00:05:08,"as he was being dognapped for the third time,"
00:05:08,00:05:10,"he must have thought, ""Mama Mia, here we go again."""
00:05:10,00:05:11,(all laughing)
00:05:11,00:05:12,- Very good.
00:05:12,00:05:13,- Thank you.
00:05:13,00:05:15,- Do you think he sent out an SOS?
00:05:15,00:05:18,(all laughing)
00:05:18,00:05:19,Are you giving the punchline to a joke
00:05:19,00:05:21,that was set up five minutes ago?
00:05:21,00:05:23,"- Yeah, I think I am."
00:05:23,00:05:24,"Anyway, look, the thieves were only interested"
00:05:24,00:05:25,"in money, money, money."
00:05:25,00:05:26,That's what they wanted.
00:05:26,00:05:28,(all laughing)
00:05:28,00:05:30,And so they sent this ransom note.
00:05:30,00:05:32,And there was a lot of dispute in the family
00:05:32,00:05:33,because her father was very tyrannical.
00:05:33,00:05:35,He didn't want a ransom paid.
00:05:35,00:05:36,But there was this contact.
00:05:36,00:05:38,There was a shoemaker called Taylor
00:05:38,00:05:40,who was the main player in the dog theft world
00:05:40,00:05:42,in Victorian London.
00:05:42,00:05:44,He was involved in a huge number of these thefts.
00:05:44,00:05:45,"He was usually not the guy to steal the dog,"
00:05:45,00:05:48,but he was the guy who would make contact
00:05:48,00:05:49,"and say, ""Oh, we've come into this dog."""
00:05:49,00:05:51,(all laughing)
00:05:51,00:05:53,- That's disgusting.
00:05:53,00:05:55,"- ""We've come into the possession of this dog."""
00:05:55,00:05:57,"- Oh, sorry, 'cause I thought you meant,"
00:05:57,00:05:58,"""All right, okay."""
00:05:58,00:06:00,(all laughing)
00:06:00,00:06:02,I find it really hard to work out exactly
00:06:02,00:06:04,what happened on all these occasions
00:06:04,00:06:08,because Virginia Woolf wrote a fictionalized version
00:06:08,00:06:10,"of Flush's dog napping, didn't she?"
00:06:10,00:06:12,She wrote a biography of this dog
00:06:12,00:06:15,in which there are loads of explanations
00:06:15,00:06:16,of how he was taken
00:06:16,00:06:18,"and then how he was gotten back and stuff,"
00:06:18,00:06:21,which God knows what's true and what's not true.
00:06:21,00:06:23,But the best bits I find probably not true.
00:06:23,00:06:24,(all laughing)
00:06:24,00:06:26,"- Yes, it's so funny."
00:06:26,00:06:29,"She wrote the whole thing in 1933,"
00:06:29,00:06:31,"or it was published in 1933, certainly."
00:06:31,00:06:32,It was quite a light book
00:06:32,00:06:33,off the back of a rather heavy
00:06:33,00:06:35,and serious brain-training one she'd just written.
00:06:35,00:06:37,"But it was her best-selling book to date,"
00:06:37,00:06:38,which must have been--
00:06:38,00:06:39,- No.
00:06:39,00:06:41,"- Yes, infuriating."
00:06:41,00:06:42,"- To now, like--"
00:06:42,00:06:44,"- No, to that point in her career,"
00:06:44,00:06:45,it was the most successful.
00:06:45,00:06:48,"Yeah, I don't think it's currently outselling"
00:06:48,00:06:49,when she's down the way.
00:06:49,00:06:51,I might be wrong.
00:06:51,00:06:53,"- You never know, maybe after this podcast."
00:06:53,00:06:55,"But she was, like, when it first came out,"
00:06:55,00:06:59,she wasn't sure if she should even publish it
00:06:59,00:07:01,because she thought that people would think
00:07:01,00:07:03,"she was like a frivolous, not very kind of--"
00:07:03,00:07:06,"- Yeah, I mean, it's a biography of someone's dog."
00:07:06,00:07:09,"- Yeah, silly lady novelist was the worry that she had."
00:07:09,00:07:11,"- She said, ""I must not let myself believe"
00:07:11,00:07:14,"that I'm simply a lady-like prattler."""
00:07:14,00:07:17,"- Well, maybe write a biography of a human being, Virginia."
00:07:17,00:07:18,- Talking dog.
00:07:18,00:07:19,Was she friends with Flush?
00:07:19,00:07:20,Did she know Flush?
00:07:20,00:07:21,And did she know Brownie?
00:07:21,00:07:22,"- No, no, no, no."
00:07:22,00:07:24,The timelines didn't cross over.
00:07:24,00:07:26,- Just to defend Virginia Woolf
00:07:26,00:07:28,"having abused her for writing about a dog,"
00:07:28,00:07:31,"it did have a serious message underneath, didn't it?"
00:07:31,00:07:33,I think she was just worried people wouldn't get it.
00:07:33,00:07:35,"So, well, this is how she defended it anyway,"
00:07:35,00:07:36,writing to her friend.
00:07:36,00:07:37,"She was like, ""Look, it's gonna seem silly"
00:07:37,00:07:39,'cause it looks like it's a biography of a dog.
00:07:39,00:07:42,"But if you read it, well, it's partly, I guess,"
00:07:42,00:07:44,"an odor Elizabeth Browning, right?"
00:07:44,00:07:47,Who was a hero for subsequent female writers
00:07:47,00:07:51,and partly a way of descending into the depths of London
00:07:51,00:07:54,and reporting on the awful poverty and social injustice there.
00:07:54,00:07:57,"Through the eyes of a dog, yes, but even so."
00:07:57,00:07:59,So it was vaguely serious.
00:07:59,00:08:01,"But it also featured a pop point,"
00:08:01,00:08:05,"which I don't think was in the real life story,"
00:08:05,00:08:08,where the dog was almost sold to a man called Pussy.
00:08:08,00:08:08,(laughing)
00:08:08,00:08:12,This part of the story was she got it
00:08:12,00:08:14,"from a friend of hers who initially had been,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,had an offer made from the brother
00:08:16,00:08:20,of the Reverend Edward Buvery Pusy.
00:08:20,00:08:21,I think we're saying it.
00:08:21,00:08:24,"- Oh, Pusy is a different name to Pussy."
00:08:24,00:08:25,- It is a different name.
00:08:25,00:08:26,(laughing)
00:08:26,00:08:29,But it is spelled in a similar way.
00:08:29,00:08:30,- Very similar.
00:08:30,00:08:34,Dognapping back then was such a big thing in London.
00:08:34,00:08:36,There was a journalist called Henry Mayhew
00:08:36,00:08:40,who estimated that in terms of individual dog stealers
00:08:40,00:08:41,"operating in London at his time,"
00:08:41,00:08:46,"it was 141 people just going around London, stealing them."
00:08:46,00:08:49,And he estimated that 45 of them
00:08:49,00:08:51,did it as their main profession.
00:08:51,00:08:53,They just actively went into it.
00:08:53,00:08:57,"And you can see there's sort of tables of sort of like 1841,"
00:08:57,00:09:01,"dogs stolen, where 43 dogs lost 521,"
00:09:01,00:09:04,"people charged 51, people discharged of that 32."
00:09:04,00:09:07,They just found it really hard to bust people
00:09:07,00:09:08,who were stealing the dogs.
00:09:08,00:09:11,"- Yeah, hang on Dan, how many dogs did you say stolen?"
00:09:11,00:09:15,"- So stolen 43, dogs lost 521."
00:09:15,00:09:18,But I imagine that there's a blur between those two
00:09:18,00:09:21,because a lot of these dog nappers got around loopholes
00:09:21,00:09:23,"by if they'd stolen a dog,"
00:09:23,00:09:25,"they would do things like make up a missing sign,"
00:09:25,00:09:28,which they would then show if they had the dog
00:09:28,00:09:29,"to a dog dealer and say,"
00:09:29,00:09:32,"""Look, I found this missing poster of this dog"
00:09:32,00:09:32,"and this is the dog."""
00:09:32,00:09:34,They buy it off them and then sell it.
00:09:34,00:09:37,"So technically, it was a missing dog."
00:09:37,00:09:39,- The guy who stole the dog makes the poster.
00:09:39,00:09:41,"- Yeah, exactly. - Saying a missing dog."
00:09:41,00:09:42,- But then he makes the poster
00:09:42,00:09:43,"and then he gives it to a dog dealer and says,"
00:09:43,00:09:45,"""I've got this dog on this missing poster,"
00:09:45,00:09:46,"can I sell it to you?"""
00:09:46,00:09:48,"- Yeah, he's like, ""Look, there's a missing poster here."
00:09:48,00:09:51,Someone's looking for this dog and I found the dog.
00:09:51,00:09:52,"So if I just give it to you,"
00:09:52,00:09:55,then you'll be able to do the deal and get the money
00:09:55,00:09:57,"and just give me half the money for now, it's fine."""
00:09:57,00:09:59,- That's so funny. - That kind of thing.
00:09:59,00:10:04,- I still think that even a total of something like 600 dogs
00:10:04,00:10:06,lost and reported stolen too.
00:10:06,00:10:10,"Given that there are 141 dog dealers in London,"
00:10:10,00:10:13,"45 of whom are doing it full-time,"
00:10:13,00:10:17,"that is what, about four dogs per person per year?"
00:10:17,00:10:18,One per quarter?
00:10:18,00:10:20,"- Yeah, that's a lot of holidays."
00:10:20,00:10:22,- It's an astonishingly low proportion of dogs.
00:10:22,00:10:23,I don't know why we're acting like
00:10:23,00:10:25,this is a lot of dogs to be stolen.
00:10:25,00:10:27,How's anyone making a profit out of this?
00:10:27,00:10:29,"- Well, they took their time, didn't they?"
00:10:29,00:10:30,Didn't they find out with Elizabeth Barrett Browning
00:10:30,00:10:33,that they'd spent two years tailing her
00:10:33,00:10:35,before they took her dog?
00:10:35,00:10:37,"Two years spotting, yeah."
00:10:37,00:10:40,"- Or is that, again, is that the Virginia Wolf story?"
00:10:40,00:10:43,"I'm not sure, I can't wait now."
00:10:43,00:10:45,The other thing is you could make some money on the side
00:10:45,00:10:48,"by stealing a dog, not getting the money back,"
00:10:48,00:10:51,"but making dog skin leather gloves,"
00:10:51,00:10:54,which are apparently a luxury item
00:10:54,00:10:56,that people like to wear.
00:10:56,00:10:58,They're very soft on the skin.
00:10:58,00:11:00,"- Yeah, have we ever worn dog outside"
00:11:00,00:11:01,of dog skin gloves?
00:11:01,00:11:03,I've never heard of it before.
00:11:03,00:11:04,- I don't know if you've seen
00:11:04,00:11:08,"the documentary 101 Dalmatians, but yeah."
00:11:08,00:11:11,- It wasn't the only dog-related trade.
00:11:11,00:11:13,"This is a bit by the by now,"
00:11:13,00:11:16,but there was a market in 1850s London for fake dog poo.
00:11:16,00:11:17,- Really?
00:11:17,00:11:20,- So there were people who were collecting real dog poo
00:11:20,00:11:22,for tanneries because it helped to soften
00:11:22,00:11:24,"and purify the leather, right?"
00:11:24,00:11:27,- Is fake dog poo just your own poo with some dog hairs
00:11:27,00:11:30,"in it, 'cause it feels like probably is."
00:11:30,00:11:32,"- Oh, God."
00:11:32,00:11:35,"Thankfully, it's just taking mortar from old walls"
00:11:35,00:11:38,and crumbling it into your existing dog poo
00:11:38,00:11:39,to bulk it out a bit.
00:11:39,00:11:43,It's a way of making your real dog poo go further.
00:11:43,00:11:45,The people who traded in it and collected it
00:11:45,00:11:49,"were originally old women who got nicknamed bunters,"
00:11:49,00:11:51,but then men started muscling in
00:11:51,00:11:53,"from about the 1820s onwards,"
00:11:53,00:11:55,and these dog poo collectors would walk the streets
00:11:55,00:11:59,"with the covered basket containing their wares,"
00:11:59,00:12:02,and some of them would wear a black leather glove
00:12:02,00:12:03,to do their collecting in.
00:12:03,00:12:04,- Only some of them.
00:12:04,00:12:05,"- Only some of them, because the others,"
00:12:05,00:12:06,they didn't have a glove.
00:12:06,00:12:09,"They said, well, look, it's easier to wash your hands"
00:12:09,00:12:10,than to clean the glove.
00:12:10,00:12:11,- I think that's a fair point.
00:12:11,00:12:13,"- Yeah, good, cool, good, cool."
00:12:13,00:12:16,I knew Anna would be the first one to say.
00:12:16,00:12:17,- Come on.
00:12:17,00:12:19,- It was pretty exciting to hear about the fact
00:12:19,00:12:21,"of London being poo-less,"
00:12:21,00:12:23,"because in the area that I live particularly,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,there is poo from dogs that have just left
00:12:25,00:12:26,"all over the streets,"
00:12:26,00:12:28,and just the idea that it was picked up
00:12:28,00:12:29,because people thought it was valuable
00:12:29,00:12:32,and needing it as part of this tanning process
00:12:32,00:12:35,"means that Victorian London was just clean,"
00:12:35,00:12:38,"in that respect, in that respect, I know it's not."
00:12:38,00:12:38,"- Interesting theory,"
00:12:38,00:12:40,'cause I think it was also a sort of thigh-deep
00:12:40,00:12:41,"in horse manure, wasn't it?"
00:12:41,00:12:43,"And technically, you could use that as well."
00:12:43,00:12:46,- It must be really hard to find dog poo
00:12:46,00:12:48,in a street that's full of horse poo.
00:12:48,00:12:51,It's almost like the 19th century equivalent
00:12:51,00:12:53,of finding a needle in a haystack
00:12:53,00:12:55,is finding a dog poo in a horse poo.
00:12:55,00:12:57,"- That was a saying, I believe that was a popular saying"
00:12:57,00:12:58,at the time.
00:12:58,00:13:00,(laughing)
00:13:00,00:13:02,(upbeat music)
00:13:02,00:13:08,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:13:08,00:13:10,and that is James.
00:13:10,00:13:12,- My fact is that the Democratic Republic of Congo
00:13:12,00:13:14,is planning an official parade
00:13:14,00:13:17,of its first prime minister's gold tooth.
00:13:17,00:13:20,- Very cool.
00:13:20,00:13:22,"- You've got to get front row seats for that, haven't you?"
00:13:22,00:13:24,"Otherwise, it's just not worth going."
00:13:24,00:13:25,"- Yeah, you're not gonna see it"
00:13:25,00:13:26,"from the back of the stadium, are you?"
00:13:26,00:13:28,- No.
00:13:28,00:13:30,"- So, I will quickly give you a short history"
00:13:30,00:13:32,of the Democratic Republic of Congo
00:13:32,00:13:35,in the last 200 years to explain what's going on here.
00:13:35,00:13:36,- Right.
00:13:36,00:13:39,- You might remember that amusing story
00:13:39,00:13:42,of Henry Martin Stanley finding Dr. Livingston.
00:13:42,00:13:44,"- Oh, wow, we really are going back, okay?"
00:13:44,00:13:45,"- We are, we are."
00:13:45,00:13:48,"- So, he said, ""Dr. Livingston, I presume,"""
00:13:48,00:13:49,and he found Dr. Livingston.
00:13:49,00:13:52,"But after that, the story took a bit of a turn,"
00:13:52,00:13:56,and Stanley was working on behalf of Leopold II of Belgium
00:13:56,00:14:00,to create this massive personal tract of land
00:14:00,00:14:02,"where he could almost farm it for ivory,"
00:14:02,00:14:03,"'cause there was so much ivory,"
00:14:03,00:14:05,so many elephants and stuff like that.
00:14:05,00:14:08,"So, he created this huge, huge country"
00:14:08,00:14:11,that was run by Leopold II of Belgium.
00:14:11,00:14:12,There was then a rubber boom
00:14:12,00:14:15,because they came up with this idea of buses.
00:14:15,00:14:17,"I don't know if you've heard of those, Dan."
00:14:17,00:14:20,"They came along in the early 20th century,"
00:14:20,00:14:22,"and so, Leopold II of Belgium"
00:14:22,00:14:25,"forced the population to work on his rubber plantations,"
00:14:25,00:14:27,and literally millions of people died
00:14:27,00:14:29,"in terrible, terrible conditions."
00:14:29,00:14:32,"In 1960, the country got its independence finally,"
00:14:32,00:14:35,"and they got a new leader called Patrice Lumumba,"
00:14:35,00:14:37,so they thought he might bring the whole country together.
00:14:37,00:14:39,But there was one area called Catanga
00:14:39,00:14:41,"that had loads of minerals,"
00:14:41,00:14:43,and the Belgians wanted to keep that under the control
00:14:43,00:14:45,after independence because they wanted
00:14:45,00:14:46,all of these minerals.
00:14:46,00:14:48,Lumumba asked the U.S. and Europe
00:14:48,00:14:50,"to help to control an uprising,"
00:14:50,00:14:51,"but U.S. and Europe didn't help,"
00:14:51,00:14:54,"and so, he turned to the Soviet Union,"
00:14:54,00:14:56,"and obviously, that sent alarm bells ringing"
00:14:56,00:14:57,in Europe and America.
00:14:57,00:14:58,"- It was an awkward time, wasn't it,"
00:14:58,00:15:00,between America and the Soviet Union?
00:15:00,00:15:01,- It was.
00:15:01,00:15:03,It was the Cold War.
00:15:03,00:15:03,- Yeah.
00:15:03,00:15:07,"- So, anyway, they assassinated this guy, Patrice Lumumba,"
00:15:07,00:15:09,"and to stop any hero worship,"
00:15:09,00:15:11,"they dissolved his body in acid,"
00:15:11,00:15:13,and there was hardly any bits left.
00:15:13,00:15:14,This gold tooth was remaining
00:15:14,00:15:17,and was taken to Belgium by one of the people
00:15:17,00:15:19,"who did the crime,"
00:15:19,00:15:22,"and then this year, finally, they're gonna get it back,"
00:15:22,00:15:24,"and they're gonna have a proper parade,"
00:15:24,00:15:27,and it'll be kind of part of their anniversary
00:15:27,00:15:29,of independence and all that kind of stuff.
00:15:29,00:15:32,"- I had never heard the story of Patrice Lumumba before,"
00:15:32,00:15:36,"and it's really, obviously, it's a completely awful story,"
00:15:36,00:15:38,"this coup against him,"
00:15:38,00:15:40,and there were apparently two different plots against him.
00:15:40,00:15:43,"One was CIA/MI6,"
00:15:43,00:15:45,"and one was Belgian,"
00:15:45,00:15:47,along with some Congolese officials as well.
00:15:47,00:15:49,"- Yeah, the CIA tried to kill him"
00:15:49,00:15:50,with some poison toothpaste.
00:15:50,00:15:52,- They apparently found it difficult
00:15:52,00:15:54,"to get the toothpaste onto his toothbrush,"
00:15:54,00:15:55,"without being noticed,"
00:15:55,00:15:58,"which, it's so rare that toothpaste is applied"
00:15:58,00:15:59,to your toothbrush without you being
00:15:59,00:16:00,in front of your toothbrush.
00:16:00,00:16:02,"- Unless you're Prince Charles,"
00:16:02,00:16:03,"unless you're Prince Charles, in which case,"
00:16:03,00:16:05,it's a twice daily occurrence.
00:16:05,00:16:06,- Is that right?
00:16:06,00:16:08,"- Yes, I'm not saying they should,"
00:16:08,00:16:10,but if the CIA wanted to knock off Prince Charles
00:16:10,00:16:13,"with this method, he would be a sitting duck."
00:16:13,00:16:13,(laughing)
00:16:13,00:16:14,"- I was just thinking,"
00:16:14,00:16:16,"it's definitely a two-man job, isn't it?"
00:16:16,00:16:19,One person to distract you so much
00:16:19,00:16:20,that you don't notice that the other person
00:16:20,00:16:21,sneaks into your bathroom
00:16:21,00:16:23,and puts toothpaste on your toothbrush
00:16:23,00:16:24,that you're holding.
00:16:24,00:16:26,"- But you'd turn back and you'd think,"
00:16:26,00:16:27,"""No, actually, you wouldn't think, you wouldn't think,"
00:16:27,00:16:29,"""did I put this toothpaste on the brush?"""
00:16:29,00:16:30,- No. - You'd just look at it
00:16:30,00:16:31,and you'd think-- - What's the other option
00:16:31,00:16:34,that it's just spontaneously arrived on your toothbrush?
00:16:34,00:16:35,That doesn't make any sense.
00:16:35,00:16:36,- Yeah.
00:16:36,00:16:37,"- They'd have to have opened the toothpaste,"
00:16:37,00:16:38,because I would be suspicious
00:16:38,00:16:40,if I hadn't got the toothpaste
00:16:40,00:16:42,"out of its special drawer yet,"
00:16:42,00:16:44,"to put it on the brush, if you know what I mean."
00:16:44,00:16:45,"- It's a tough location all around, isn't it?"
00:16:45,00:16:47,"'Cause if you're brushing your teeth,"
00:16:47,00:16:49,"most likely you're staring into a giant mirror,"
00:16:49,00:16:51,which would knock out anyone's chance
00:16:51,00:16:52,of sneaking up behind you.
00:16:52,00:16:53,(laughing)
00:16:53,00:16:55,- That's a really good point.
00:16:55,00:16:58,"Whose tooth do you think is the most expensive,"
00:16:58,00:17:02,"John Lennon's, or Elvis Presley's?"
00:17:02,00:17:06,- Does one of them have more teeth in circulation?
00:17:06,00:17:08,I can't look out why that would be.
00:17:08,00:17:09,"- Oh, yeah, interesting."
00:17:09,00:17:11,"- Okay, this gives you a bit of a clue."
00:17:11,00:17:13,Both of these are owned by the same guy
00:17:13,00:17:16,who is a tooth collector of celebrities.
00:17:16,00:17:18,"- Oh, okay."
00:17:18,00:17:19,"- This is a weird tooth fairy, dude."
00:17:19,00:17:21,(laughing)
00:17:21,00:17:22,"- I'm gonna say John Lennon,"
00:17:22,00:17:24,because there's probably more bits of Elvis Presley
00:17:24,00:17:28,"on the market, like his toenails and so on,"
00:17:28,00:17:29,that you can get access to.
00:17:29,00:17:30,- I'll say Elvis.
00:17:30,00:17:31,I'll say Elvis is bigger.
00:17:31,00:17:33,I think the sort of people who want the teeth
00:17:33,00:17:35,will be more interested in Elvis than Lennon.
00:17:35,00:17:36,- I don't know why there are more bits
00:17:36,00:17:39,of the dismembered Elvis Presley on the market
00:17:39,00:17:41,than there are of apparently dismembered
00:17:41,00:17:42,John Lennon.
00:17:42,00:17:43,I just realized their body parts
00:17:43,00:17:45,were in circulation at all.
00:17:45,00:17:48,"- Well, I know that we know where his Elvis's wart is."
00:17:48,00:17:50,It's in a museum in America.
00:17:50,00:17:52,"There's, remember, possibly his toenail"
00:17:52,00:17:53,that we've mentioned.
00:17:53,00:17:54,"- Yes, yeah."
00:17:54,00:17:57,"- So, you know, bits of Elvis are all over the shop."
00:17:57,00:17:58,- That's a really good argument.
00:17:58,00:18:02,"- James, stop this interminable debate and tell us."
00:18:02,00:18:07,- The answer is that Elvis Presley's dental crown
00:18:07,00:18:12,"was $10,000, whereas John Lennon's tooth was $31,000."
00:18:12,00:18:14,- Yes!
00:18:14,00:18:17,"- So, three times more for John Lennon."
00:18:17,00:18:17,"- Fuck it, Murray."
00:18:17,00:18:18,- But that's a crown.
00:18:18,00:18:19,That's different.
00:18:19,00:18:21,"It's a crown, although he was the king."
00:18:21,00:18:21,- Exactly.
00:18:21,00:18:24,"So, they do, they call it the king's crown."
00:18:24,00:18:25,(laughing)
00:18:25,00:18:26,And it was worn by Elvis Presley
00:18:26,00:18:28,until he cracked it on a microphone
00:18:28,00:18:31,while performing in Las Vegas in 1971.
00:18:31,00:18:33,And they eventually found its way
00:18:33,00:18:35,into the collection of Michael Zuck.
00:18:35,00:18:38,And Michael Zuck also bought one of John Lennon's
00:18:38,00:18:42,"extracted teeth, which Lennon had given"
00:18:42,00:18:45,to his housekeeper.jallet.
00:18:45,00:18:46,- Wow.
00:18:46,00:18:47,- A weird move.
00:18:47,00:18:48,Let's say a weird move.
00:18:48,00:18:49,"- It's not, it's not."
00:18:49,00:18:49,- Unless his housekeeper asked for it.
00:18:49,00:18:50,- Look how much it's worth.
00:18:50,00:18:53,"If you were as famous as Elvis or John Lennon,"
00:18:53,00:18:56,"if I cut off a fingernail, if I cut a strand of hair,"
00:18:56,00:18:58,"hand it to someone, it's gonna make them money."
00:18:58,00:19:00,"You are, your whole body is worth stuff."
00:19:00,00:19:02,I think it's a wonderful present.
00:19:02,00:19:04,"- I've got a question about the Elvis thing,"
00:19:04,00:19:06,which is that you said he cracked his crown
00:19:06,00:19:07,on a microphone during a gig.
00:19:07,00:19:10,"Now look, I'm not saying our gigs go like Elvis's."
00:19:10,00:19:12,"I'm not saying our audiences are as raucous,"
00:19:12,00:19:15,but that's quite the gig where you're shoving your microphone
00:19:15,00:19:18,into your mouth to the extent it cracks a dental crown.
00:19:18,00:19:21,- I don't think he was shoving his microphone
00:19:21,00:19:23,into his mouth.
00:19:23,00:19:25,I think it's probably more of an accidental kind of
00:19:25,00:19:27,swinging it around that it hits you in the face.
00:19:27,00:19:30,I don't think he was deep-throating the microphone.
00:19:30,00:19:32,"- No, no, if you watch concerts, that was his style."
00:19:32,00:19:33,He sang from the back of the throat
00:19:33,00:19:34,and he took that literally.
00:19:34,00:19:36,So he would throw it all the way back.
00:19:36,00:19:38,(laughing)
00:19:38,00:19:40,"Hey, just, I was looking into,"
00:19:40,00:19:42,'cause this gold tooth is a relic.
00:19:42,00:19:45,And I was just looking at other political leader relics
00:19:45,00:19:46,that we still have.
00:19:46,00:19:49,And have you guys heard of Chairman Mao's mango?
00:19:49,00:19:51,- No.
00:19:51,00:19:54,- Is it like Elizabeth Brown in Spanish?
00:19:54,00:19:58,"- This was basically during the Cultural Revolution,"
00:19:58,00:19:59,there was a big fight that happened
00:19:59,00:20:01,"when one of the universities in Beijing,"
00:20:01,00:20:05,"Tsinghua University, and Mao sent 30,000 workers"
00:20:05,00:20:09,to try and stop all of the sort of weird groups
00:20:09,00:20:11,that were breaking out and causing ruckus
00:20:11,00:20:13,"in China at the time, sent these workers to stop that."
00:20:13,00:20:15,And there was a huge fight there.
00:20:15,00:20:17,The workers were not prepared for the fight
00:20:17,00:20:18,'cause they basically came with just pictures
00:20:18,00:20:19,"of Chairman Mao, a little red book,"
00:20:19,00:20:23,whereas the other people had like bricks and spears and acid.
00:20:23,00:20:24,And so it was a huge fight.
00:20:24,00:20:27,And eventually these workers won.
00:20:27,00:20:32,"And as a reward, Chairman Mao gave them 40 mangoes."
00:20:32,00:20:33,Mao never gave presents.
00:20:33,00:20:36,"And so it was seen as a high, high honor."
00:20:36,00:20:38,But the main thing was that no one in Northern China
00:20:38,00:20:40,at this point really knew what mangoes were.
00:20:40,00:20:43,"So all of them were just staying up at night,"
00:20:43,00:20:45,"looking at it, smelling them, caressing them."
00:20:45,00:20:48,And they were thinking we need to make sure
00:20:48,00:20:50,"that this mango, this special thing"
00:20:50,00:20:51,that he's given to us remains with us.
00:20:51,00:20:55,And so they had it waxed and they put it in from aldehyde
00:20:55,00:20:58,and they made sure that it just stayed proper.
00:20:58,00:21:00,"And as a result, it got taken everywhere"
00:21:00,00:21:03,and everyone was looking at Chairman Mao's mango.
00:21:03,00:21:04,The Communist Party seeing this
00:21:04,00:21:05,turned it into a propaganda thing.
00:21:05,00:21:08,So there was merchandise that you could buy.
00:21:08,00:21:10,"Everywhere you went, there were like tin cups"
00:21:10,00:21:12,with mangoes on them and so on.
00:21:12,00:21:16,"And it became this massive thing, the Chairman Mao mango."
00:21:16,00:21:19,- Doesn't it slightly go against the principles
00:21:19,00:21:21,held within the little red book
00:21:21,00:21:23,to turn your mango into merchandise?
00:21:23,00:21:25,- How does Mao feel about that?
00:21:25,00:21:27,- I don't think it's that granular on the detail.
00:21:27,00:21:28,- Yeah.
00:21:28,00:21:30,- The little red book.
00:21:30,00:21:31,"It probably does go against the principles,"
00:21:31,00:21:32,but there's a loophole I'm sure.
00:21:32,00:21:34,"- Okay, it's the mango loophole."
00:21:34,00:21:36,- Flog your mango around the place.
00:21:36,00:21:39,"- We talk about this on QI, I don't know if it ever went out,"
00:21:39,00:21:40,"but the question that we asked was,"
00:21:40,00:21:43,how mad could a mango make a mango?
00:21:43,00:21:45,"- Ah, nice. - Very nice."
00:21:45,00:21:47,- What was the answer to how?
00:21:47,00:21:49,- How mad could a mango make a mango?
00:21:49,00:21:52,"- Well, the answer was the anecdote that you just told me."
00:21:52,00:21:53,"- Ah, was it?"
00:21:53,00:21:53,"That went out on QI, didn't it?"
00:21:53,00:21:56,"- I don't know if it was really with a format of QI, Dan,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,but often there's not just like one straight answer.
00:21:58,00:22:00,It's sometimes a bit of a left field thing.
00:22:00,00:22:03,"- I, yeah, I should start watching that show."
00:22:03,00:22:04,(laughing)
00:22:04,00:22:07,- There's one piece of material
00:22:07,00:22:09,"that's lasted a very long time,"
00:22:09,00:22:11,which probably you'll all be familiar with.
00:22:11,00:22:11,- Oh yeah.
00:22:11,00:22:14,- And that is the Virgin Mary toast.
00:22:14,00:22:17,"So can everyone, can you remember the toast,"
00:22:17,00:22:19,the famous toast with the face of the Virgin Mary?
00:22:19,00:22:21,"- Yeah, okay, it's what it sounds like."
00:22:21,00:22:24,"Yeah, it was sort of, I think it was a big hit."
00:22:24,00:22:25,"It was like the biggest celebrity of the '90s,"
00:22:25,00:22:26,along with the Spice Girls.
00:22:26,00:22:31,"1996, this woman was eating toast, Diana Doyser,"
00:22:31,00:22:36,and she took a tiny bite of her toast
00:22:36,00:22:37,and then realized the Virgin Mary's face
00:22:37,00:22:38,was staring up at her.
00:22:38,00:22:43,And so she preserved it in between two bits of hard plastic.
00:22:43,00:22:46,- She should have preserved it between two pieces of cheese.
00:22:46,00:22:48,That would have made it an anti-sandwich
00:22:48,00:22:51,and would have made it worth even more.
00:22:51,00:22:53,You could have put it in between two slices of bread
00:22:53,00:22:55,"and had like a toast sandwich,"
00:22:55,00:22:57,"which is something that you can eat, isn't it?"
00:22:57,00:22:58,"- Yes, absolutely."
00:22:58,00:23:01,"A club sandwich is kind of like that, isn't it?"
00:23:01,00:23:02,"- Yeah, I feel like we're not going"
00:23:02,00:23:04,to the point of Anna's story here.
00:23:04,00:23:06,"- I'm not sure there is a point to this story,"
00:23:06,00:23:06,but let's hear it out.
00:23:06,00:23:09,Apparently she was as big as the Spice Girls.
00:23:09,00:23:11,I look forward to hearing about the reunion tour
00:23:11,00:23:12,and her getting her own movie.
00:23:12,00:23:14,"- Well, you may be surprised."
00:23:14,00:23:16,So none of your solutions afforded the Virgin Mary
00:23:16,00:23:18,"the kind of respect that Diana wanted to,"
00:23:18,00:23:20,'cause she's a devout Christian.
00:23:20,00:23:22,"So she preserved it and she said,"
00:23:22,00:23:23,she had like 10 years of good luck.
00:23:23,00:23:28,"She won $70,000 in a casino because of this toast."
00:23:28,00:23:31,And then it was picked up by--
00:23:31,00:23:34,- Is there more detail on that or not?
00:23:34,00:23:35,"- Yeah, whispered over her ear."
00:23:35,00:23:36,- Put it all on bread.
00:23:36,00:23:37,(all laughing)
00:23:37,00:23:39,- Put it all on bread.
00:23:39,00:23:41,(all laughing)
00:23:41,00:23:45,"- She kept a piece of toast,"
00:23:45,00:23:47,thinking this will bring me luck.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"And then in the next decade, she won 70 grand."
00:23:49,00:23:51,"If you don't think that's 'cause of the toast,"
00:23:51,00:23:52,then that's your problem.
00:23:52,00:23:55,"- Sure, it's just a way to wear the crust."
00:23:55,00:23:55,- Oh my God.
00:23:55,00:23:58,(all laughing)
00:23:58,00:24:00,"- Anyway, it's now held by another casino,"
00:24:00,00:24:02,"GoldenPalace.com,"
00:24:02,00:24:04,which is a casino known for collecting
00:24:04,00:24:07,these strange modern day relics.
00:24:07,00:24:10,"And they bought it for $28,000."
00:24:10,00:24:11,"- Oh, wow."
00:24:11,00:24:13,Is that why the house always wins?
00:24:13,00:24:16,Because they've got the ultimate sort of talisman there.
00:24:16,00:24:17,"- Yes, exactly."
00:24:17,00:24:18,That is very lucky.
00:24:18,00:24:19,"- As they said, when they bought it off her,"
00:24:19,00:24:22,our customers are really gonna get a kick
00:24:22,00:24:24,out of seeing this sandwich.
00:24:24,00:24:26,And they actually paid for her to go on tour with it
00:24:26,00:24:29,and to the Taj Mahal and to Red Square.
00:24:29,00:24:31,- The Taj Mahal.
00:24:31,00:24:32,- To the Eiffel Tower.
00:24:32,00:24:33,(all laughing)
00:24:33,00:24:34,- Wow.
00:24:34,00:24:35,"- It was very nice for Diana,"
00:24:35,00:24:38,who said she'd never been on holiday in her life.
00:24:38,00:24:41,She'd spent her life looking after her elderly parents.
00:24:41,00:24:42,She got to do this world tour.
00:24:42,00:24:44,"- She must have had a real,"
00:24:44,00:24:47,wry smile on her face as she got off the plane.
00:24:47,00:24:50,"- Oh yeah, 'cause that's the type of bread, isn't it?"
00:24:50,00:24:51,- Absolutely.
00:24:51,00:24:52,Maybe it was a whole grin.
00:24:52,00:24:54,(all laughing)
00:24:54,00:24:56,There's another toothy relic that I found.
00:24:56,00:24:59,"Actually, it's more of just a wonderful tooth removal"
00:24:59,00:25:00,than a relic.
00:25:00,00:25:01,I don't know if the tooth has been preserved.
00:25:01,00:25:03,But it was from 2015.
00:25:03,00:25:06,And it was a young girl called Ellie Clay.
00:25:06,00:25:09,And she had her tooth removed by javelin.
00:25:09,00:25:12,So someone stood 100 meters away and threw a javelin
00:25:12,00:25:14,and it just lunded directly in her face
00:25:14,00:25:16,while the tooth was.
00:25:16,00:25:19,- That would have been very impressive.
00:25:19,00:25:22,"They did it in reverse, the health and safety nuts."
00:25:22,00:25:25,Her father was an Olympic javelin thrower
00:25:25,00:25:27,and she had a very loose tooth.
00:25:27,00:25:29,And so they tied a bit of dental floss
00:25:29,00:25:30,carefully around the tooth.
00:25:30,00:25:32,"They tied the dental floss to a javelin,"
00:25:32,00:25:34,I guess a very long bit of dental floss.
00:25:34,00:25:39,And then he just chucked the javelin 30 meters.
00:25:39,00:25:40,They made sure it was a really loose tooth
00:25:40,00:25:42,"before they did it, obviously."
00:25:42,00:25:44,So she didn't go flying after it.
00:25:44,00:25:46,- And her whole family have these crazy methods
00:25:46,00:25:47,of removing teeth.
00:25:47,00:25:49,They've done it by putting a bit of floss
00:25:49,00:25:50,on the family dog's collar
00:25:50,00:25:52,and then getting the dog to run off.
00:25:52,00:25:54,That's one thing I've tried.
00:25:54,00:25:56,Lots of stuff.
00:25:56,00:25:57,- That actually wasn't a removal attempt.
00:25:57,00:26:00,"The dog was just stolen midway through a wall, wasn't it?"
00:26:00,00:26:02,(upbeat music)
00:26:02,00:26:10,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:26:10,00:26:12,And that is Anna.
00:26:12,00:26:14,"- My fact this week is that in the 1920s,"
00:26:14,00:26:17,thousands of people with the surname Drake
00:26:17,00:26:19,fought a legal battle to inherit
00:26:19,00:26:22,Sir Francis Drake's fortune.
00:26:22,00:26:22,- Wow.
00:26:22,00:26:28,- This is just an amazing scam that was pulled.
00:26:28,00:26:30,And it was based on a rumor
00:26:30,00:26:33,that's basically been going around since Francis Drake died.
00:26:33,00:26:35,And he didn't really have any direct descendants
00:26:35,00:26:37,and everyone claimed that he had hidden fortune
00:26:37,00:26:40,that wasn't inherited by anyone and that's sitting somewhere.
00:26:40,00:26:44,And fast forward to 1914.
00:26:44,00:26:46,It starts with these con artists.
00:26:46,00:26:48,There's a woman called Sadie Whitaker
00:26:48,00:26:51,and she's going around Iowa claiming her cousin's heir
00:26:51,00:26:52,"to this ancient Drake fortune,"
00:26:52,00:26:54,which is now just worth so much
00:26:54,00:26:58,because it's gained so much interest over the last 300 years.
00:26:58,00:27:02,"And she swindles this Iowa farm woman out of $6,000"
00:27:02,00:27:04,'cause she convinces her that if she buys shares
00:27:04,00:27:07,"in this schemed kind of retrieve Francis Drake's lost wealth,"
00:27:07,00:27:09,then she'll get a cut in it.
00:27:09,00:27:11,"Now this woman's son, this poor farm woman's son,"
00:27:11,00:27:13,"is a guy called Oscar Hartzell,"
00:27:13,00:27:17,"who rather than going to defend his mother's honor and money,"
00:27:17,00:27:20,"thinks, what a good trick, I'm gonna build on that."
00:27:20,00:27:21,And he joins up with them
00:27:21,00:27:25,and Oscar Hartzell sets up the Francis Drake Association.
00:27:25,00:27:28,He writes to thousands of people across the state
00:27:28,00:27:31,"that are cross America with the name Drake saying,"
00:27:31,00:27:33,Francis Drake's fortune is being held
00:27:33,00:27:35,"by the British government, those bastards."
00:27:35,00:27:36,We've got to wrench it back.
00:27:36,00:27:38,You're probably all related to him.
00:27:38,00:27:40,You pay me some money and I'll go and get it for you.
00:27:40,00:27:41,- It's so convincing. - Yeah.
00:27:41,00:27:43,It's so convincing that I feel like I want to sign up to it
00:27:43,00:27:45,despite not being called Drake and state.
00:27:45,00:27:46,"- Well, it doesn't matter."
00:27:46,00:27:48,It doesn't matter that you're not called Drake.
00:27:48,00:27:49,This was his genius.
00:27:49,00:27:50,"He had 70,000 people signed up,"
00:27:50,00:27:52,including people not called Drake.
00:27:52,00:27:53,He just opened it up.
00:27:53,00:27:55,"Everyone, get in, get in."
00:27:55,00:27:56,- He expanded.
00:27:56,00:27:57,"He suddenly went, hang on, people really are idiots."
00:27:57,00:27:59,I'm gonna make this a bit bigger.
00:27:59,00:28:00,- Who got the money in the end?
00:28:00,00:28:01,Was it the rapper or?
00:28:01,00:28:03,- That's where it is.
00:28:03,00:28:05,- You can spend as much time rapping now.
00:28:05,00:28:06,It's certainly not through album sales.
00:28:06,00:28:07,I'll tell you that much.
00:28:07,00:28:08,That's unfair.
00:28:08,00:28:10,I'm sure he sells very well.
00:28:10,00:28:12,(laughing)
00:28:12,00:28:15,- That is the most handy thing I've ever heard
00:28:15,00:28:16,in my entire life.
00:28:16,00:28:17,"- Oh, I'm sure."
00:28:17,00:28:20,"Young Drake, I'm sure he does very well for himself."
00:28:20,00:28:21,- Mr. Drake.
00:28:21,00:28:24,"So there's no money, is there?"
00:28:24,00:28:24,- No.
00:28:24,00:28:26,"- A complete nest of lies from the top to the finish, yeah."
00:28:26,00:28:29,"- Once someone dies, if they have a will,"
00:28:29,00:28:31,"after 30 years, if you don't sort it out,"
00:28:31,00:28:32,then it all goes to the crown.
00:28:32,00:28:34,"So there wouldn't be any money anyway,"
00:28:34,00:28:35,even if there was some money.
00:28:35,00:28:39,"But I think in the end, it went to his wife"
00:28:39,00:28:40,or his brother or something.
00:28:40,00:28:41,"Like, they know where it went."
00:28:41,00:28:44,"- Yeah, it went to a nephew or something of his in the end."
00:28:44,00:28:45,There was nothing very exciting about it.
00:28:45,00:28:47,But everyone was so convinced
00:28:47,00:28:48,"that this guy was telling the truth,"
00:28:48,00:28:51,that the FBI actually investigated
00:28:51,00:28:53,what had happened to Francis Drake's money
00:28:53,00:28:55,in the late 1500s.
00:28:55,00:28:56,- It's just brilliant.
00:28:56,00:28:58,"- And like you say, it concluded it had gone to his wife"
00:28:58,00:28:59,and then down to some of his descendants.
00:28:59,00:29:02,"But the details, the details were so convincing"
00:29:02,00:29:05,because he said it was worth about a hundred billion pounds.
00:29:05,00:29:06,I'm not sure whether that's in modern money
00:29:06,00:29:09,"or in 1930s money,"
00:29:09,00:29:11,'cause that would presumably have bought America.
00:29:11,00:29:14,"But one of the things he said was the entire city of Plymouth,"
00:29:14,00:29:16,that happens to be part of the Drake estate.
00:29:16,00:29:17,So...
00:29:17,00:29:18,"- Yeah, he said, I think he went up"
00:29:18,00:29:20,"to 400 billion at one stage,"
00:29:20,00:29:23,'cause he kind of just said different amounts all the time.
00:29:23,00:29:24,"And he said that as soon as he got the money,"
00:29:24,00:29:28,obviously everyone would get the bit that they asked for.
00:29:28,00:29:30,They would get a return on their money.
00:29:30,00:29:32,But he said that he was gonna go back to America
00:29:32,00:29:34,"and he was gonna buy up,"
00:29:34,00:29:38,I think Missouri and the IOR and a few other states
00:29:38,00:29:39,and he was gonna put a big fence around them
00:29:39,00:29:42,"and just live in them, that's what he claimed."
00:29:42,00:29:44,- His powers of persuasion just sound extraordinary.
00:29:44,00:29:46,"'Cause once he got back to America,"
00:29:46,00:29:48,he was taken to trial in 1933.
00:29:48,00:29:52,"And yet, even though he was being held accountable for it,"
00:29:52,00:29:53,he still managed to get people
00:29:53,00:29:55,who were subscribing to this scheme
00:29:55,00:29:59,"to contribute $350,000 in legal defense fund"
00:29:59,00:30:01,to make sure he didn't go to jail.
00:30:01,00:30:02,He did go to jail.
00:30:02,00:30:04,He got given a 10-year sentence.
00:30:04,00:30:07,"And even then, still, his agents were able to claw"
00:30:07,00:30:10,another half million dollars from these subscribers
00:30:10,00:30:12,to make sure that he was doing okay.
00:30:12,00:30:14,"- It is, I mean, it's kind of because it was presented"
00:30:14,00:30:15,as an investment.
00:30:15,00:30:18,"People were told, this is an investment"
00:30:18,00:30:20,"to fund the legal case, to fight the British government"
00:30:20,00:30:23,"and get this money out of them, which we know is there."
00:30:23,00:30:26,"And if you invest $1 for every dollar you will invest,"
00:30:26,00:30:28,you will get 500 back.
00:30:28,00:30:29,That was the idea.
00:30:29,00:30:30,"And so when you put it like that,"
00:30:30,00:30:33,"it starts to sound like, oh, well, I am spending now,"
00:30:33,00:30:35,"but it's an investment, you know?"
00:30:35,00:30:35,- Yeah.
00:30:35,00:30:38,"And also, it sort of makes sense."
00:30:38,00:30:39,Given what we know these days
00:30:39,00:30:41,"about how irrationally people can act,"
00:30:41,00:30:45,it makes sense that it actually convinced people even more
00:30:45,00:30:47,"when he was convicted that what he'd said was true,"
00:30:47,00:30:49,"because it was like, well, why has the British government"
00:30:49,00:30:51,turned against him like this?
00:30:51,00:30:52,Why have they put him in prison?
00:30:52,00:30:53,He's obviously onto them.
00:30:53,00:30:54,- They want to keep Plymouth.
00:30:54,00:30:54,"- You know, the same way that--"
00:30:54,00:30:57,- They're desperate to cling on to the beauties of Plymouth
00:30:57,00:30:58,and they will not let it go.
00:30:58,00:30:59,- Exactly.
00:30:59,00:31:03,But it's just like today when you get someone like Alex Jones
00:31:03,00:31:04,"or a conspiracy theorist, right?"
00:31:04,00:31:06,And then people jump down their throats.
00:31:06,00:31:08,"And then that makes their supporters,"
00:31:08,00:31:11,their knee-jerk reaction is to dig down even harder
00:31:11,00:31:12,"and say, well, he's definitely telling the truth."
00:31:12,00:31:13,"- Yes, yeah."
00:31:13,00:31:15,So Francis Drake?
00:31:15,00:31:15,- Yeah.
00:31:15,00:31:18,"- Who, we haven't really said who he is yet,"
00:31:18,00:31:19,just for the benefit of any listeners
00:31:19,00:31:21,who are not up on their Drake.
00:31:21,00:31:26,"He was a pirate, privateer,"
00:31:26,00:31:28,"all-round coastal bandit,"
00:31:28,00:31:31,"mayor of Plymouth, briefly."
00:31:31,00:31:34,"- British hero or pirates, would you say?"
00:31:34,00:31:36,"- British hero, slave trader."
00:31:36,00:31:38,It's so hard to tell where one begins on the other end.
00:31:38,00:31:39,- Most likely known.
00:31:39,00:31:42,He was the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe.
00:31:42,00:31:42,- Yes.
00:31:42,00:31:44,- Is possibly what he's most known for.
00:31:44,00:31:47,- Or possibly most well-known for the Spanish Armada
00:31:47,00:31:49,being the supposed head of--
00:31:49,00:31:50,- Yes.
00:31:50,00:31:52,"- No, he wasn't the head of the Spanish Armada."
00:31:52,00:31:53,He was the opposite of that.
00:31:53,00:31:54,- He was the opposite of that.
00:31:54,00:31:55,"- Quite the reverse, yeah, yeah."
00:31:55,00:31:56,He was the tail of the Spanish Armada.
00:31:56,00:32:00,"He supposedly was the head of the force that defeated it, yeah."
00:32:00,00:32:02,"Yeah, I mean, like a really mixed career,"
00:32:02,00:32:03,did start out as a slave trader
00:32:03,00:32:06,and then became a great English hero.
00:32:06,00:32:09,"So, you know, definitely a mixed scorecard, I would say."
00:32:09,00:32:11,"- An English hero for the time,"
00:32:11,00:32:14,which basically meant he stole shed loads of money
00:32:14,00:32:16,"off other countries and handed it to Queen Elizabeth,"
00:32:16,00:32:20,"which, you know, that's how you wanna make a penny."
00:32:20,00:32:22,- That was the benchmark in those days for English hero.
00:32:22,00:32:23,"Yeah, yeah, absolutely."
00:32:23,00:32:26,He seems like a very difficult man to get along with.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"On one of his voyages,"
00:32:28,00:32:32,he accused his second in command of witchcraft
00:32:32,00:32:34,and had a show trial and then had his head chopped off.
00:32:34,00:32:35,- Wow.
00:32:35,00:32:36,- Yeah.
00:32:36,00:32:37,- Doughty.
00:32:37,00:32:38,- Thomas Doughty.
00:32:38,00:32:41,"Not Doughty enough to resist having his head chopped off,"
00:32:41,00:32:41,I don't know.
00:32:41,00:32:43,"- Well, I doubt he thought much of that trial."
00:32:43,00:32:45,- Oh boy.
00:32:45,00:32:47,I doubt he would like to hear us talking about him
00:32:47,00:32:48,in this way.
00:32:48,00:32:50,(laughing)
00:32:50,00:32:51,"- He had a sense of humor, actually, Thomas Doughty."
00:32:51,00:32:54,So perhaps he would have loved this.
00:32:54,00:32:58,"Yeah, he allegedly, once he was told"
00:32:58,00:32:59,"that he was gonna be beheaded by Drake,"
00:32:59,00:33:03,basically unfairly for bitching about Drake behind his back.
00:33:03,00:33:06,"He said, ""Can I take communion with you first?"""
00:33:06,00:33:09,"And then according to accounts that were pro and anti Drake,"
00:33:09,00:33:11,they both took communion together
00:33:11,00:33:13,and then had a great laugh and a banter and a chat
00:33:13,00:33:15,about the good old days when they were friends.
00:33:15,00:33:17,And then Drake chopped his head off.
00:33:17,00:33:20,"And in fact, Drake offered him,"
00:33:20,00:33:22,and now this is according to Drake's nephew
00:33:22,00:33:23,"who wrote an account,"
00:33:23,00:33:25,which was based on diaries of people at the time.
00:33:25,00:33:27,"But apparently Drake said,"
00:33:27,00:33:31,"""Look, 'cause I feel bad about this whole unjustly"
00:33:31,00:33:32,beheading you thing.
00:33:32,00:33:34,Do you want me to shoot you instead?
00:33:34,00:33:37,"Because then you will have been shot by a gentleman."""
00:33:37,00:33:38,"And that's nicer, isn't it?"
00:33:38,00:33:39,- Wow.
00:33:39,00:33:39,"- And Doughty said,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,"""Thanks, that's so sweet of you to offer,"
00:33:41,00:33:43,"but I'll just go for the straight up beheading."""
00:33:43,00:33:43,- Right.
00:33:43,00:33:45,"- It's quite a weird incident,"
00:33:45,00:33:46,"but it's hard to tell, isn't it?"
00:33:46,00:33:48,'Cause there are so many pro-Drake and anti-Drake
00:33:48,00:33:51,but it's a propaganda over the last 300 years.
00:33:51,00:33:54,You don't know if it was a goody or a bady to work for.
00:33:54,00:33:55,- Yeah.
00:33:55,00:33:56,"Well, there was one bad thing."
00:33:56,00:33:57,"When they went round the world,"
00:33:57,00:33:59,"second navigator of the world,"
00:33:59,00:34:01,and they took a woman from El Salvador
00:34:01,00:34:05,and she got pregnant and they dumped her on an island.
00:34:05,00:34:09,"And then what you're saying about propaganda,"
00:34:09,00:34:12,"a few years later, Shakespeare wrote ""The Tempest"""
00:34:12,00:34:14,"and there is a character, Sycorax,"
00:34:14,00:34:17,"who is an African woman who is dumped on an island,"
00:34:17,00:34:19,I think got pregnant.
00:34:19,00:34:22,"And there is an idea suggested, probably true,"
00:34:22,00:34:24,"that Shakespeare based that on this woman, Mariah."
00:34:24,00:34:26,"- Oh, wow."
00:34:26,00:34:27,- That is interesting.
00:34:27,00:34:29,- That's so interesting about the idea
00:34:29,00:34:32,that there was superstitions and witchcraft
00:34:32,00:34:33,that you were mentioning in relation to Doughty
00:34:33,00:34:36,because Drake was the kind of guy
00:34:36,00:34:41,who other Spanish mariners would create these tales about
00:34:41,00:34:43,as if he did have these amazing abilities.
00:34:43,00:34:45,There was all these rumors that went around him.
00:34:45,00:34:48,There was the rumor that he possessed a magic mirror
00:34:48,00:34:50,that allowed him to spy on the locations
00:34:50,00:34:52,of the ships on the sea.
00:34:52,00:34:54,"They just thought, how could he know where our ships were?"
00:34:54,00:34:55,"- If they were behind him, for instance,"
00:34:55,00:34:57,he'd be able to spy on them.
00:34:57,00:34:58,- Exactly.
00:34:58,00:35:03,They thought he had sort of contact with witches from Devon
00:35:03,00:35:06,and that he could raise storms against the Spanish Armada.
00:35:06,00:35:09,Just so many of these weird tales.
00:35:09,00:35:11,"There was a tale that Elizabeth Sydenham,"
00:35:11,00:35:13,who he was in love with
00:35:13,00:35:14,"and she wanted to marry him,"
00:35:14,00:35:16,but the family said that this was not going to happen.
00:35:16,00:35:18,And then he went off and she got bored.
00:35:18,00:35:20,She was about to marry someone.
00:35:20,00:35:22,"On the day that she was meant to marry him,"
00:35:22,00:35:25,a huge cannonball fell at her feet
00:35:25,00:35:27,that had been fired from Drake's cannon
00:35:27,00:35:30,from across the world in order to stop the wedding.
00:35:30,00:35:33,That was a story that went around.
00:35:33,00:35:35,"- Actually, Drake was just trying to remove a tooth, wasn't he?"
00:35:35,00:35:36,(laughing)
00:35:36,00:35:38,That's completely misinterpreted.
00:35:38,00:35:40,"- Imagine that if you say that line in the wedding,"
00:35:40,00:35:42,does anyone here have any reason?
00:35:42,00:35:45,And everyone's sort of sniggering behind their hands.
00:35:45,00:35:46,So I wonder if someone will say something
00:35:46,00:35:50,that a massive cannonball lands in the middle of the church.
00:35:50,00:35:53,"- Yeah, she did later marry Drake."
00:35:53,00:35:54,They did get married.
00:35:54,00:35:55,"But yeah, that was one of the stories."
00:35:55,00:35:57,He was full of all these abilities.
00:35:57,00:35:59,"- I've just got one more thing,"
00:35:59,00:36:04,which is another 1930s Francis Drake-based swindle.
00:36:04,00:36:08,This was the story of a young man
00:36:08,00:36:11,"who went for a hike in San Francisco Bay in 1936,"
00:36:11,00:36:14,and he found a metal plate on the ground.
00:36:14,00:36:14,"He didn't think much of it,"
00:36:14,00:36:15,"but his friends pointed out,"
00:36:15,00:36:18,"""It appeared to say Francis Drake on it."""
00:36:18,00:36:20,"And so he said, ""All right, I'll get it checked out."""
00:36:20,00:36:23,He took it to a professor at the University of California
00:36:23,00:36:24,"called Herbert Bolton,"
00:36:24,00:36:27,who was a world expert on the history of the Americas.
00:36:27,00:36:29,"And when Bolton saw this plate,"
00:36:29,00:36:31,he became unbelievably excited.
00:36:31,00:36:33,"He said, ""This is the Drake plate."""
00:36:33,00:36:36,It proves that he arrived in California.
00:36:36,00:36:38,"There was a story that Drake, when he reached California,"
00:36:38,00:36:40,"he left a brass plate there with some writing on,"
00:36:40,00:36:43,"""And this looked like it."""
00:36:43,00:36:44,"Nearly 400 years later,"
00:36:44,00:36:47,this is a seminal piece of the history of the world.
00:36:47,00:36:49,This proves something incredible.
00:36:49,00:36:51,The spelling looked legit.
00:36:51,00:36:53,The language on it looked legit.
00:36:53,00:36:56,And this was announced with great brouhaha.
00:36:56,00:36:57,"There was some people who doubted it,"
00:36:57,00:36:59,but it was announced as being real.
00:36:59,00:37:02,"And then in 1977, there was a celebration of 400 years"
00:37:02,00:37:04,"since Drake had reached California,"
00:37:04,00:37:08,"and it was tested, and it was so, so clearly a fake."
00:37:08,00:37:09,There was way too much zinc.
00:37:09,00:37:11,"It had been cut around the edges by a metal saw,"
00:37:11,00:37:13,which hadn't existed at the time.
00:37:13,00:37:15,"And the awful thing was,"
00:37:15,00:37:18,"Herbert Bolton, the professor, had students"
00:37:18,00:37:20,who knew how interested he was in this subject.
00:37:20,00:37:22,"They had made a fake plate,"
00:37:22,00:37:23,and they had left it for someone to find.
00:37:23,00:37:27,"He had found it, and he spent the rest of his life"
00:37:27,00:37:28,believing in it.
00:37:28,00:37:30,"And the problem was he had gone public so quickly,"
00:37:30,00:37:31,and he had got so excited
00:37:31,00:37:33,"that his students were too embarrassed to say,"
00:37:33,00:37:35,"""It's not real, we fake the whole thing."""
00:37:35,00:37:38,So he went to his grave believing in the plate.
00:37:38,00:37:39,"- Oh, well, that's all right."
00:37:39,00:37:40,- And then he went to his grave.
00:37:40,00:37:41,(laughing)
00:37:41,00:37:42,- That's fine.
00:37:42,00:37:43,"- I guess you're right, yeah, yeah."
00:37:43,00:37:45,"- That plate is really interesting,"
00:37:45,00:37:47,or the idea that Drake sort of claimed
00:37:47,00:37:50,"that part of California for England,"
00:37:50,00:37:54,"and said, ""Okay, this land mass is now ours."""
00:37:54,00:37:56,"When, of course, the Spanish were kind of working"
00:37:56,00:37:59,their way up through Mexico and through that side.
00:37:59,00:38:02,"The Spanish were really, really annoyed about this."
00:38:02,00:38:05,But the lucky thing was that they ran
00:38:05,00:38:07,"all of the map makers,"
00:38:07,00:38:09,"or rather, the map makers were mostly in, like,"
00:38:09,00:38:11,"Netherlands and Belgium and stuff,"
00:38:11,00:38:13,but they were in charge of that area.
00:38:13,00:38:15,And so they got all the map makers to pretend
00:38:15,00:38:18,that California was an island.
00:38:18,00:38:21,"And you know, you see those old maps"
00:38:21,00:38:22,where California was an island?
00:38:22,00:38:24,"Well, that was the Spanish basically saying,"
00:38:24,00:38:27,"""This thing that Francis Drake has claimed for England"
00:38:27,00:38:28,"""is not the whole of America,"
00:38:28,00:38:31,"""it's just a little kind of island on the side."""
00:38:31,00:38:32,- Right.
00:38:32,00:38:34,"- So technically, if California is English property,"
00:38:34,00:38:36,"but Plymouth belongs to the States,"
00:38:36,00:38:38,should we just have an exchange now
00:38:38,00:38:39,and keep things the same?
00:38:39,00:38:41,"- I think no one can argue with that,"
00:38:41,00:38:42,can they?
00:38:42,00:38:43,If we get California and they get Plymouth.
00:38:43,00:38:45,"- It's a win-win, guys."
00:38:45,00:38:47,(upbeat music)
00:38:47,00:38:53,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:38:53,00:38:54,and that is my fact.
00:38:54,00:38:57,My fact this week is that 20th century
00:38:57,00:39:00,American science fiction works include the titles
00:39:00,00:39:04,"""Servants of the Wank"" and ""Planet of the Knobheads."""
00:39:04,00:39:07,"- Oh, aren't we all, in a way, ""Servants of the Wank""?"
00:39:07,00:39:10,(both laughing)
00:39:10,00:39:14,- So these were legit books that were published.
00:39:14,00:39:16,"""Planet of the Knobheads"" published in 1939"
00:39:16,00:39:18,"by Stanton A. Koblenz,"
00:39:18,00:39:22,"and in 1969, ""Servants of the Wank"" was published,"
00:39:22,00:39:24,and that was by Jack Vance.
00:39:24,00:39:28,- I think British readers might not recognize
00:39:28,00:39:29,"""Servants of the Wank"""
00:39:29,00:39:31,'cause it got renamed in Britain
00:39:31,00:39:34,"because for obvious reasons, yeah."
00:39:34,00:39:36,"- Well, it's not spelled the same."
00:39:36,00:39:38,"I mean, I'm not convinced we're pronouncing it right."
00:39:38,00:39:41,"Very clearly to me, it looks like ""Servants of the Wank."""
00:39:41,00:39:42,- The wanker?
00:39:42,00:39:43,(both laughing)
00:39:43,00:39:44,- That's just not funny.
00:39:44,00:39:47,"- It is, it's spelled W-A-N-K-H."
00:39:47,00:39:51,"I would say it's wank, like with like, lock, like lock."
00:39:51,00:39:52,"- Yeah, wank, wank."
00:39:52,00:39:53,"- I don't know, Anna."
00:39:53,00:39:54,For someone who humorously mispronounced
00:39:54,00:39:56,"the perfectly ordinary name, Pusy,"
00:39:56,00:39:58,"as pussy for comic effect, I don't think"
00:39:58,00:40:00,you're gonna like to stand on.
00:40:00,00:40:03,"- Did you read the, did you read the synopsis"
00:40:03,00:40:05,"of any of these ""Servants of the Wank"" down, for instance?"
00:40:05,00:40:07,"- I did, give it to us, it's brilliant."
00:40:07,00:40:09,- A couple of humans land on a planet
00:40:09,00:40:12,and there's loads of different groups there.
00:40:12,00:40:14,One of them are the wank.
00:40:14,00:40:17,"Basically, there's a group called the wank men."
00:40:17,00:40:20,"And the wank men are the ""Servants of the Wank"""
00:40:20,00:40:23,that the humans who are working under the wank.
00:40:23,00:40:25,"- Well, it's Adam Wreath, isn't it?"
00:40:25,00:40:27,It's this guy who crashes onto the planet
00:40:27,00:40:30,"and he needs to get off, so his ship doesn't work."
00:40:30,00:40:32,So he needs to steal the wank spaceship
00:40:32,00:40:35,"in order to get out of there, is the main plot."
00:40:35,00:40:37,"- Well, yeah, but then you've got all these four groups"
00:40:37,00:40:39,who are fighting against each other
00:40:39,00:40:41,"and you've got the wank men who, it turns out,"
00:40:41,00:40:44,have been destroying anything that the wank
00:40:44,00:40:47,have been making to try and make a war
00:40:47,00:40:51,between the wank and another group called the deer deer.
00:40:51,00:40:53,And when the wank find out that the wank men
00:40:53,00:40:55,"have been destroying all of their wank machines,"
00:40:55,00:40:59,then they expel the wank men from the wank cities.
00:40:59,00:41:03,And this guy who Dan's talking about gets to leave
00:41:03,00:41:04,on his spaceship.
00:41:04,00:41:05,- Yeah.
00:41:05,00:41:06,"- It's a happy ending, you might say."
00:41:06,00:41:08,(laughing)
00:41:08,00:41:09,"- Are you all right, Andy?"
00:41:09,00:41:11,- I'm all right.
00:41:11,00:41:11,Oh my God.
00:41:11,00:41:15,- We'll get for that as you were in.
00:41:15,00:41:17,(laughing)
00:41:17,00:41:20,"- Look, for the listener,"
00:41:20,00:41:22,Andy did actually just blow his nose with a tissue.
00:41:22,00:41:25,"- The wank men, they serve the wank."
00:41:25,00:41:26,"But yes, what is the wank?"
00:41:26,00:41:30,"- Well, the wank is a group of people and they're on war,"
00:41:30,00:41:33,but the wank men want to keep the status quo
00:41:33,00:41:35,because they want to carry on the cushy lives
00:41:35,00:41:37,looking after the wank.
00:41:37,00:41:41,And so they're kind of causing mayhem.
00:41:41,00:41:44,"But actually, when the wank find out about the wank men"
00:41:44,00:41:46,"destroying all their stuff, then they get expelled."
00:41:46,00:41:49,- And Adam doesn't seem to be the first human there
00:41:49,00:41:52,because there are other human wank men who are there.
00:41:52,00:41:54,They serve under the wank and they handle
00:41:54,00:41:57,all the communication between the wank masters
00:41:57,00:42:00,and the rest of the people who live on the planet.
00:42:00,00:42:01,- Yeah.
00:42:01,00:42:03,I feel like I've gone into like a Dungeons and Dragons
00:42:03,00:42:06,discussion group or something after hours
00:42:06,00:42:10,"or like, you know, game of thrones, fan clubs, been off."
00:42:10,00:42:13,Are we gonna go through the whole plot of wankers
00:42:13,00:42:15,or whatever it's called?
00:42:15,00:42:16,- That was the plot.
00:42:16,00:42:17,That's the plot.
00:42:17,00:42:17,- That's it.
00:42:17,00:42:18,- Oh my God.
00:42:18,00:42:20,"- He had to change the title in the end,"
00:42:20,00:42:22,"as James says, when it came to Britain"
00:42:22,00:42:25,"because I think they thought, Anna's probably right,"
00:42:25,00:42:27,"the H might be pronounced differently,"
00:42:27,00:42:28,but why don't we not take any risks?
00:42:28,00:42:31,"So they changed it to, I think,"
00:42:31,00:42:33,what was another alien species on there
00:42:33,00:42:36,called the Chesh or the Chash.
00:42:36,00:42:41,And the wank were renamed the Wannick.
00:42:41,00:42:43,So W-A-N-N-E-K.
00:42:43,00:42:44,"- Okay, okay."
00:42:44,00:42:47,"- Imagine being the author, Jack Vance,"
00:42:47,00:42:50,having to go back and just one by one change wank to Wannick.
00:42:50,00:42:54,- He must be able to control H or a control H
00:42:54,00:42:55,or a control G or whatever it is.
00:42:55,00:42:56,"- Well, it's 1969."
00:42:56,00:42:57,We didn't have that.
00:42:57,00:42:59,- Isn't it funny that it's 69?
00:42:59,00:43:00,It's just a whole nother layer
00:43:00,00:43:03,that I hadn't realized until just then.
00:43:03,00:43:05,"- Jack Vance, author of the wank,"
00:43:05,00:43:07,was a really interesting guy.
00:43:07,00:43:09,"He, yeah, he was a fascinating author."
00:43:09,00:43:11,He wrote sci-fi all his life
00:43:11,00:43:13,"and amazing works of fantasy, huge great works,"
00:43:13,00:43:15,pioneered the dying earth genre.
00:43:15,00:43:16,"In fact, I think this work"
00:43:16,00:43:18,"was part of his Dying Earth series,"
00:43:18,00:43:21,but Vance himself was an electrician at Pearl Harbor
00:43:21,00:43:23,"when he was in the US Navy,"
00:43:23,00:43:26,"but he left, he was discharged with prejudice,"
00:43:26,00:43:27,"very bored of Navy life,"
00:43:27,00:43:29,"and he got home a week before Pearl Harbor,"
00:43:29,00:43:31,Pearl Harbor before the bombings.
00:43:31,00:43:32,So he really luckily dodged that.
00:43:32,00:43:35,"- Sorry, when you say he was discharged with prejudice,"
00:43:35,00:43:36,what is that?
00:43:36,00:43:37,- So usually with prejudice means
00:43:37,00:43:39,that it's like a final legal decision
00:43:39,00:43:41,and you can't appeal it or anything like that.
00:43:41,00:43:45,So I guess probably it might be dishonorable discharge
00:43:45,00:43:47,"with prejudice, which means that you're out"
00:43:47,00:43:49,"when you can't come back, I'm not sure."
00:43:49,00:43:50,"- Got it, yeah."
00:43:50,00:43:51,"- Ironically, for a man who wrote"
00:43:51,00:43:53,"a book called Servants of the Wank,"
00:43:53,00:43:55,he left with a dishonorable discharge.
00:43:55,00:43:56,So...
00:43:56,00:43:59,(laughing)
00:43:59,00:44:02,"But he, after the USA entered the war,"
00:44:02,00:44:03,"he got back into the Navy,"
00:44:03,00:44:05,and this is the crazy thing.
00:44:05,00:44:06,He had very bad eyesight.
00:44:06,00:44:08,"No jokes, please. - Ironically, again?"
00:44:08,00:44:10,"- No, no, no, no, no."
00:44:10,00:44:15,"He got into the merchant Navy by memorizing an eye chart,"
00:44:15,00:44:16,"and that was how he got in, yeah."
00:44:16,00:44:17,- Yeah.
00:44:17,00:44:18,- But you don't know what eye chart
00:44:18,00:44:20,"you're gonna get, do you?"
00:44:20,00:44:20,Are they all the same?
00:44:20,00:44:21,"- Must be, yeah."
00:44:21,00:44:22,- What?
00:44:22,00:44:24,You're kidding?
00:44:24,00:44:25,We could all just memorize the eye chart
00:44:25,00:44:26,and cheat the eye test.
00:44:26,00:44:27,- Why do you wanna do that?
00:44:27,00:44:29,"- I think there are three or four eye charts now, Anna."
00:44:29,00:44:31,"And also, yeah, absolutely don't cheat on your eye test."
00:44:31,00:44:34,"It's not, there's not a pass mark for the eye test."
00:44:34,00:44:35,(laughing)
00:44:35,00:44:37,"There's no reward for passing,"
00:44:37,00:44:40,"apart from a continued bad sight, if you cheat."
00:44:40,00:44:41,- I like to do well.
00:44:41,00:44:42,(laughing)
00:44:42,00:44:45,- So I thought I would see if the word Wank with KH
00:44:45,00:44:49,has found its way in literature any other times in history.
00:44:49,00:44:53,And so I went onto Google books to look for instances
00:44:53,00:44:56,of the word Wank with W-A-N-K-H.
00:44:56,00:44:58,And they only found two examples.
00:44:58,00:45:01,"One is a book called ""Penciled Frown"" by James Gray,"
00:45:01,00:45:04,which is a 1925 satire about the newspaper industry.
00:45:04,00:45:07,And I'll just give you a quote.
00:45:07,00:45:10,"""One man made primitive sounds as he played his cards,"
00:45:10,00:45:14,"""expressive of complacent confidence in his strategies."
00:45:14,00:45:16,"""Wank said the player,"
00:45:16,00:45:19,"""said the player in triumph."
00:45:19,00:45:22,"""Wank, Wank, Wank, Wank and Wank."
00:45:22,00:45:25,"""At each utterance, a card was flung on the table."""
00:45:25,00:45:29,(laughing)
00:45:29,00:45:31,"- Okay, what was this word?"
00:45:31,00:45:33,Never used before or since.
00:45:33,00:45:36,"- It's just an onomatopoeic word of, you know,"
00:45:36,00:45:38,"triumph, I think."
00:45:38,00:45:41,"- Right, he's just trying to invent a new exclamation."
00:45:41,00:45:43,"- Yeah, and the only other example"
00:45:43,00:45:45,of the word Wank I can find in the whole of history
00:45:45,00:45:47,"of literature, according to Google books,"
00:45:47,00:45:50,is from a systematic and ecological study
00:45:50,00:45:52,of birds of New Guinea by Dylan Ripley.
00:45:52,00:45:54,And it's about the collared brush turkey.
00:45:54,00:45:57,It says this species was common on the Tami River
00:45:57,00:45:59,in heavy evergreen forest.
00:45:59,00:46:01,"It's called Wank, Wank."
00:46:01,00:46:02,(laughing)
00:46:02,00:46:06,"In an ascending scale was frequent morning and evening,"
00:46:06,00:46:09,and presumably more common as egg laying was in progress.
00:46:09,00:46:10,So there you are.
00:46:10,00:46:13,"- Wow, very cool."
00:46:13,00:46:17,And James Harkins' book club will return next month.
00:46:17,00:46:19,(laughing)
00:46:19,00:46:23,- So I found Planet of the Knobhead's a bit harder
00:46:23,00:46:25,to get sort of blurb on.
00:46:25,00:46:26,I only found a few bits.
00:46:26,00:46:27,Did you guys find any?
00:46:27,00:46:30,"There was, the bit I saw was that it's the story"
00:46:30,00:46:32,"of newlyweds, Jack and Marjorie Wainwright,"
00:46:32,00:46:35,who are big stars in the scientific world.
00:46:35,00:46:37,And then they get kidnapped by aliens.
00:46:37,00:46:40,They get taken to this Knobhead planet
00:46:40,00:46:43,and they meet high nobule.
00:46:43,00:46:46,"And there's just a line that was put in there,"
00:46:46,00:46:48,"which I can't tell, someone was writing a blurb,"
00:46:48,00:46:49,but then added this line.
00:46:49,00:46:50,I think it might be an extract.
00:46:50,00:46:51,"It's a line that just says,"
00:46:51,00:46:52,in about a week I had recovered
00:46:52,00:46:55,from most of the effects of the Knob operation.
00:46:55,00:46:59,"So little hints as to what happens in the plot,"
00:46:59,00:47:00,but not too sure.
00:47:00,00:47:03,- Did you read sort of like the digest?
00:47:03,00:47:07,Was this the blinkest digest about the Knobhead's you got?
00:47:07,00:47:09,- The word Knobhead originally meant
00:47:09,00:47:12,"like the end of a cane or the end of a screw,"
00:47:12,00:47:15,"for instance, any kind of knobby bit on the end of it."
00:47:15,00:47:16,"- Well, if you see the aliens in it,"
00:47:16,00:47:18,they look very robotic
00:47:18,00:47:20,and they have giant knobs on their head.
00:47:20,00:47:22,"And so, hence the Knobheads."
00:47:22,00:47:26,"- So we talked about science fiction,"
00:47:26,00:47:29,"the origin of science fiction on our comic relief marathon,"
00:47:29,00:47:31,but I don't think we've mentioned it here.
00:47:31,00:47:33,So Hugo Gernsback is the person
00:47:33,00:47:35,who coined the term science fiction.
00:47:35,00:47:38,He sort of thought of as the father of science fiction.
00:47:38,00:47:41,"He founded a magazine in the 1920s, devoted to it."
00:47:41,00:47:43,It was called Amazing Stories.
00:47:43,00:47:45,And the Hugo's are the awards
00:47:45,00:47:47,"that are named after him, science fiction awards."
00:47:47,00:47:50,"In the early days, he referred to it as scientific fiction."
00:47:50,00:47:52,And then it became science fiction over the years.
00:47:52,00:47:56,But he hated the Hugo awards
00:47:56,00:47:58,because he thought that they didn't award science fiction.
00:47:58,00:48:02,"So basically the first nine winners of the awards,"
00:48:02,00:48:05,he said only one of them was a natural piece
00:48:05,00:48:06,of science fiction. - Really?
00:48:06,00:48:07,- All the rest were fantasy.
00:48:07,00:48:08,- Wow. - He was very strict
00:48:08,00:48:09,about what it was.
00:48:09,00:48:12,"It has to be, it has to have three components."
00:48:12,00:48:14,It has to have charming romance.
00:48:14,00:48:15,It has to have thrilling adventure
00:48:15,00:48:17,and it has to have scientific facts.
00:48:17,00:48:18,"- Wow, 'cause two of those things"
00:48:18,00:48:19,have nothing to do with science fiction.
00:48:19,00:48:21,"- And not according to Hugo,"
00:48:21,00:48:23,"the creator of sci-fi, I'm afraid."
00:48:23,00:48:24,"- Yeah, but it sounds like he didn't know"
00:48:24,00:48:26,what it was nine times in a row.
00:48:26,00:48:30,So I think I'm on the side of the award organizers.
00:48:30,00:48:32,"- To be fair to him, I think he was on your side, Dan,"
00:48:32,00:48:35,and he said these don't contain enough scientific facts.
00:48:35,00:48:37,So he wanted them to be educational.
00:48:37,00:48:39,Like 25% of each science fiction book
00:48:39,00:48:41,should be educational.
00:48:41,00:48:42,- That's a high bar to clear.
00:48:42,00:48:44,25%? - Yes.
00:48:44,00:48:47,"- Hey, you know, so famous science fiction writers,"
00:48:47,00:48:51,"Isaac Asimov has to be right up there in the top five, really."
00:48:51,00:48:54,And he's famous for the three laws of robotics.
00:48:54,00:48:56,But do you guys know how many actual laws there are
00:48:56,00:48:58,in the three laws of robotics?
00:48:58,00:49:01,"- Well, I've read those books, iRobot books, right?"
00:49:01,00:49:04,"And I thought it was like, first one is,"
00:49:04,00:49:05,they can't do any harm.
00:49:05,00:49:07,"And the second one is something like,"
00:49:07,00:49:10,"unless there's danger is gonna happen to a human,"
00:49:10,00:49:12,then they can do some harm or something.
00:49:12,00:49:14,And I can't remember what the third one was.
00:49:14,00:49:15,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:49:15,00:49:17,A robot may not injure a human being.
00:49:17,00:49:19,"Is the first one, there's more to that."
00:49:19,00:49:22,"A robot must obey the orders given by human beings,"
00:49:22,00:49:25,except when such orders would conflict with the first law.
00:49:25,00:49:27,"And then the third law, a robot must protect"
00:49:27,00:49:29,its own existence as long as such protection
00:49:29,00:49:32,does not conflict with the first or second law.
00:49:32,00:49:34,- So those were the three and he revised them a few times.
00:49:34,00:49:36,"- Sorry, can I just ask, are these the three laws"
00:49:36,00:49:37,within a piece of fiction?
00:49:37,00:49:39,"What's the laws, where are they applying?"
00:49:39,00:49:41,"- Basically, he wrote all these stories"
00:49:41,00:49:44,that basically use those three laws as your trick.
00:49:44,00:49:46,And every single one of the stories
00:49:46,00:49:49,"has uses those as a trick, don't they, I think?"
00:49:49,00:49:50,"- Yes, yeah, exactly."
00:49:50,00:49:53,He just created the sort of the rules of sci-fi
00:49:53,00:49:55,for robots with this.
00:49:55,00:49:58,"So he revised them a number of times during his lifetime,"
00:49:58,00:50:01,but then he decided to add another law.
00:50:01,00:50:03,"But obviously, very annoying to have to rewrite"
00:50:03,00:50:06,and call it the four laws of robotics.
00:50:06,00:50:07,So he managed to do it.
00:50:07,00:50:10,He added the fourth law in by going backwards.
00:50:10,00:50:11,So there's a zero-
00:50:11,00:50:14,"- Oh, that's, yeah, that's standard, I think."
00:50:14,00:50:17,Like there's a zero-floor of thermodynamics as well
00:50:17,00:50:19,"inside, so a few things like that, yeah."
00:50:19,00:50:20,- That's the equivalent of going back
00:50:20,00:50:23,"and changing Wank to Wanek all the way through, isn't it?"
00:50:23,00:50:25,"- Yes, yeah, exactly."
00:50:25,00:50:27,So there's actually four laws in the three laws of robotics
00:50:27,00:50:30,and that fourth one is a robot may not harm humanity
00:50:30,00:50:33,or by an action allow humanity to come to harm.
00:50:33,00:50:34,- A high bar to clear.
00:50:34,00:50:38,- I read about the first ever sci-fi convention.
00:50:38,00:50:40,"- Oh, yes, yeah."
00:50:40,00:50:45,- This was a fundraiser by a man called Dr. Herbert Tippitz
00:50:45,00:50:47,who was the founder of London's West End Hospital
00:50:47,00:50:50,and School of Massage and Electricity.
00:50:50,00:50:53,And he'd read this book by Edward Bulllitton
00:50:53,00:50:56,"called ""Real the Power of the Coming Race."""
00:50:56,00:50:58,"And he thought, ""What a great idea."
00:50:58,00:51:01,"""I will set up a little convention"
00:51:01,00:51:05,"""where people can dress up as characters from this book"
00:51:05,00:51:08,"""and it'll make us a load of money for my hospital."""
00:51:08,00:51:10,And so he did.
00:51:10,00:51:13,He spent an absolute ton of money setting it up.
00:51:13,00:51:17,"There was magic shows, it was kind of"
00:51:17,00:51:19,like an Egyptian style bit of sci-fi.
00:51:19,00:51:22,"So everyone dressed in all these Egyptian garbs,"
00:51:22,00:51:25,sometimes in ancient Greek clothing.
00:51:25,00:51:28,Everyone got these little glasses of bovril
00:51:28,00:51:33,because there was a magic fluid called Vril in this book.
00:51:33,00:51:37,And the company that was making beef extract drinks
00:51:37,00:51:40,decided to rebrand and call themselves bovril
00:51:40,00:51:43,in honor of this amazing book.
00:51:43,00:51:45,"People could go along, there was a demon dog"
00:51:45,00:51:48,who could read minds that you could go and see.
00:51:48,00:51:50,"There was all sorts of stuff happening,"
00:51:50,00:51:53,but then basically it didn't go according to plan.
00:51:53,00:51:56,There was a critic writing in the magazine Truth
00:51:56,00:51:59,"who said, ""A more humiliating display of witless"
00:51:59,00:52:03,"""and purell fantasticalities was never designed."""
00:52:03,00:52:04,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:52:04,00:52:06,- And everyone basically hated it.
00:52:06,00:52:08,It was supposed to run for three days.
00:52:08,00:52:10,"They actually ran for five days,"
00:52:10,00:52:11,"but not because everyone wanted to go,"
00:52:11,00:52:13,it was just because so few people went
00:52:13,00:52:15,that they wanted to get one or two more people
00:52:15,00:52:18,through the door so they could make some of the money back.
00:52:18,00:52:21,"And the guy lost 1,600 pounds"
00:52:21,00:52:23,rather than making any money for his hospitals
00:52:23,00:52:25,and declared himself bankrupt.
00:52:25,00:52:27,- Wow. - Such a shame.
00:52:27,00:52:29,"- That whole thing, it feels like it's an argument"
00:52:29,00:52:32,for the fact that we never develop time travel
00:52:32,00:52:35,in our history because obviously time travelers
00:52:35,00:52:38,would all want to go to the first ever sci-fi convention
00:52:38,00:52:40,because that would be an amazing thing.
00:52:40,00:52:41,And that guy would have coined it in
00:52:41,00:52:42,if we ever invented time travel.
00:52:42,00:52:46,- That sounds like a really good kind of meta sci-fi story
00:52:46,00:52:48,to say of all the time travelers going back there.
00:52:48,00:52:50,- I think that's probably the real reason
00:52:50,00:52:51,they extended it for two days
00:52:51,00:52:52,because they think in the future
00:52:52,00:52:54,we're gonna have to up the capacity limit here
00:52:54,00:52:57,for when all the time travelers come back.
00:52:57,00:52:58,"Yeah, and they had this whole thing,"
00:52:58,00:53:00,they had an opening ceremony
00:53:00,00:53:01,where they had Prince Henry and Princess Beatrice
00:53:01,00:53:04,of Battenburg come and do the official opening
00:53:04,00:53:07,and they were accepting donations right from the get go
00:53:07,00:53:09,as soon as they announced the opening
00:53:09,00:53:12,where people who were representatives of organizations
00:53:12,00:53:14,would approach them and they would drop purses filled
00:53:14,00:53:15,with donations in front of them.
00:53:15,00:53:17,"So it looked like, oh, the money's coming in,"
00:53:17,00:53:19,this is a huge success.
00:53:19,00:53:21,And one of the things they discovered afterwards
00:53:21,00:53:23,when money was not being made
00:53:23,00:53:24,and all the things had gone wrong
00:53:24,00:53:27,is that the purses that were being dropped were all props
00:53:27,00:53:28,and there was nothing in there.
00:53:28,00:53:31,"And so they didn't even have that to rely on, yeah."
00:53:31,00:53:32,"- Come on, Battenburgs,"
00:53:32,00:53:33,they should have just done a cake sale to you.
00:53:33,00:53:35,(laughing)
00:53:35,00:53:41,"- Okay, that's it."
00:53:41,00:53:43,That is all of our facts.
