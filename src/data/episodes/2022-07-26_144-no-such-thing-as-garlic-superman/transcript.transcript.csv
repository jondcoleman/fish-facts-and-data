00:00:00,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:22,to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:27,"My name is Dan Shriver and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Alex Bell and Andrew"
00:00:27,00:00:31,Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:31,00:00:36,"facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:39,"Starting with you, Andy Murray."
00:00:39,00:00:46,"My fact is that in 1851, all of the 436,800 sandwiches sold on the streets of London were"
00:00:46,00:00:48,ham.
00:00:48,00:00:50,Just ham sandwiches.
00:00:50,00:00:53,That's so obviously not true.
00:00:53,00:00:55,"Well, I think it is."
00:00:55,00:00:58,Was it just ham or did they have ham and pickle or ham and mustard or?
00:00:58,00:00:59,Add to mustard.
00:00:59,00:01:00,Okay.
00:01:00,00:01:04,Had other sandwiches been invented at that point and they thought we don't actually like
00:01:04,00:01:05,those will stick with ham.
00:01:05,00:01:07,I think they have because I think they had cheese sandwiches because we've said before
00:01:07,00:01:10,on this podcast these people called bread and meat or bread and cheese.
00:01:10,00:01:11,Yeah.
00:01:11,00:01:15,So I'll tell you basically ham sandwiching was a thing as in you didn't have a sandwich
00:01:15,00:01:16,shop.
00:01:16,00:01:20,You would be a sandwich seller and you have your own ham and you would boil it and then
00:01:20,00:01:23,you would sell it from your car so it's quite hard to have a big range and we only know
00:01:23,00:01:28,about this because there was a guy called Henry Mayhew who was a social investigator and
00:01:28,00:01:32,he wrote this huge work called London Labor and the London Poor.
00:01:32,00:01:36,And he calculated that that number of sandwiches was sold and the only ones he came across
00:01:36,00:01:38,were ham ones.
00:01:38,00:01:40,So he's pretty amazing this guy.
00:01:40,00:01:41,He is.
00:01:41,00:01:42,I hadn't heard of him.
00:01:42,00:01:47,He co-founded Punch which was the original British satirical magazine that ran for a
00:01:47,00:01:48,"God, hundreds of years."
00:01:48,00:01:49,So might this have been satire?
00:01:49,00:01:50,What are you talking about?
00:01:50,00:01:51,No.
00:01:51,00:01:55,"And B Wilson, who's a food writer and her book is very good."
00:01:55,00:01:59,She also has written an essay on the subject and she said that all the sandwiches were ham.
00:01:59,00:02:02,If B Wilson says it then I do believe it.
00:02:02,00:02:06,But even before the went and did punch he had the most ridiculous childhood.
00:02:06,00:02:09,He ran away from home and he was 12 to join the East India company.
00:02:09,00:02:10,Wow.
00:02:10,00:02:14,And worked on their ships and then he came back and tried to law and then he went as journalists
00:02:14,00:02:15,and but 12.
00:02:15,00:02:16,He ran away and he was 12.
00:02:16,00:02:17,But you know how people used to die younger?
00:02:17,00:02:18,Is it like dog years?
00:02:18,00:02:21,"Well, actually like 18 back then."
00:02:21,00:02:25,"Well, I guess kind of but also it was he ran away because he didn't want to follow the same"
00:02:25,00:02:26,career as his father.
00:02:26,00:02:27,It's a pretty early age.
00:02:27,00:02:28,What did his father do?
00:02:28,00:02:29,He was a sailor.
00:02:29,00:02:30,Yeah.
00:02:30,00:02:31,I think he was an accountant.
00:02:31,00:02:33,"Well, I can understand that."
00:02:33,00:02:37,"He was a very fertile accountant because Henry May, he was one of 17 children."
00:02:37,00:02:38,"Well, I see."
00:02:38,00:02:39,17.
00:02:39,00:02:40,Wow.
00:02:40,00:02:44,He did report on his sandwich investigation that one seller told him that sometimes
00:02:44,00:02:50,cab drivers would offer to fight them for a sandwich instead of paying for it.
00:02:50,00:02:53,Doesn't really feel like it would be a good idea.
00:02:53,00:02:58,"Well, it doesn't work in print when I try it because as a sandwich seller, the best outcome"
00:02:58,00:03:04,"is that you've won a fight and kept your sandwich, but you've had to fight someone not"
00:03:04,00:03:05,to lose a sandwich.
00:03:05,00:03:06,Exactly.
00:03:06,00:03:10,It feels like it would be better for you to do nothing at all than to get involved in
00:03:10,00:03:11,this fight.
00:03:11,00:03:12,Yeah.
00:03:12,00:03:13,Yeah.
00:03:13,00:03:16,This isn't the best hand-based story from 1851.
00:03:16,00:03:19,"It was a good deal, wasn't it?"
00:03:19,00:03:20,"It was a very, very strong idea."
00:03:20,00:03:22,"Basically, when I was half in 1851, just give it a second."
00:03:22,00:03:23,"Yeah, sure."
00:03:23,00:03:24,Great exhibition happened in London.
00:03:24,00:03:25,And it was just ham sandwiches on the way.
00:03:25,00:03:26,Yeah.
00:03:26,00:03:28,"Well, didn't they have tin food as one of the attractions?"
00:03:28,00:03:30,I guess ham may have been there.
00:03:30,00:03:31,Ah.
00:03:31,00:03:32,"And also, Moby Dick was published."
00:03:32,00:03:36,"I've got to say the best Moby Dick fact ever, which we all know because it was found"
00:03:36,00:03:42,"by one of our colleagues, Edward Kitchens, this last week, which is that he got a rejection"
00:03:42,00:03:47,"letter from one publisher saying, ""The whale is obviously a nice idea, but maybe you could"
00:03:47,00:03:50,replace it by something more popular.
00:03:50,00:03:51,"Maybe young voluptuous maiden."""
00:03:51,00:03:55,Why would you want to harpoon young voluptuous maiden?
00:03:55,00:03:56,That's true.
00:03:56,00:03:57,Like any sense?
00:03:57,00:03:58,"I would've been like, ""Carry."""
00:03:58,00:03:59,It would've just been horror.
00:03:59,00:04:00,Horror dolls.
00:04:00,00:04:01,"Hang on, hang on, Dan."
00:04:01,00:04:04,You said you had a better ham anecdote from 1851.
00:04:04,00:04:05,Yeah.
00:04:05,00:04:06,"Well, OK."
00:04:06,00:04:07,Alex.
00:04:07,00:04:08,Alex.
00:04:08,00:04:09,Alex.
00:04:09,00:04:10,Alex.
00:04:10,00:04:11,"We all did it in our heads, James."
00:04:11,00:04:13,A podcast like that.
00:04:13,00:04:14,Yeah.
00:04:14,00:04:18,"So, other news, Alex mentions the great exhibition, Moby Dick."
00:04:18,00:04:22,Two other things that happened in 1851 is that the New York Times was founded and Reuters
00:04:22,00:04:24,News was founded as well.
00:04:24,00:04:29,"So obviously, a lot more outlet to report ham-based stories were erupting that year."
00:04:29,00:04:33,"So, Christmas in 1851, have you heard about this in London?"
00:04:33,00:04:38,It was a sort of super great giveaway to all the poor of London to feed them on Christmas
00:04:38,00:04:39,day.
00:04:39,00:04:45,"And it was over 22,000 people who were fed in one single place, and that place was called"
00:04:45,00:04:46,Ham Yard.
00:04:46,00:04:50,"And Ham Yard in London, they had benefactors from all the richest people in London who gave"
00:04:50,00:04:55,"one guy called Mr. Richard Cooper, supplied 200 pounds of beef."
00:04:55,00:05:00,And they did a massive Christmas meal for all the less privileged of London.
00:05:00,00:05:04,"So, over 22,000 people fed in one go by a very famous chef."
00:05:04,00:05:08,"He's often called the first celebrity chef, Alexis Sawyer."
00:05:08,00:05:11,"And it was his idea, and he put it together, and he fed all these people."
00:05:11,00:05:12,Wow.
00:05:12,00:05:13,Yeah.
00:05:13,00:05:14,I've been to Ham Yard.
00:05:14,00:05:15,It's all for Regent Street.
00:05:15,00:05:16,"Yes, it's all there, right?"
00:05:16,00:05:17,It's still there.
00:05:17,00:05:18,Yeah.
00:05:18,00:05:21,The best ham sandwich related story of the mid-19th century.
00:05:21,00:05:24,"Okay, that's cheating a bit."
00:05:24,00:05:25,"Well, it is."
00:05:25,00:05:30,"This comes from around 1840, so it's about 10 years before both of your ham-sandwich stories."
00:05:30,00:05:32,"Oh, and there's way better than if you've got predated."
00:05:32,00:05:33,It's true.
00:05:33,00:05:36,"So, the town of Swindon was invented by a ham sandwich."
00:05:36,00:05:37,What?
00:05:37,00:05:40,"It was founded by a ham sandwich, let's say."
00:05:40,00:05:45,"The story goes, I don't know if this is true, that Izanbar Kinden Brunel was on the railway,"
00:05:45,00:05:48,and he knew that they had to found a town somewhere on the railway because they needed to have
00:05:48,00:05:50,a stop there.
00:05:50,00:05:54,"And he started eating his ham sandwich, and then he thought, ""Well, as soon as I've had"
00:05:54,00:05:56,"enough of this sandwich and I throw it out of the window, wherever it lands, that's"
00:05:56,00:05:59,"where I'm going to start my new town."""
00:05:59,00:06:01,And it landed where currently Swindon is.
00:06:01,00:06:02,Anyway.
00:06:02,00:06:04,But I'm paying on.
00:06:04,00:06:10,Because you'd have to stop the train immediately and go back and find the sandwich.
00:06:10,00:06:12,That is true.
00:06:12,00:06:13,Unless you remember.
00:06:13,00:06:17,"Oh, we were passing through Swindon when I threw my sandwich out of the window, and I threw"
00:06:17,00:06:22,"my sandwich out right next to that sign that says, ""Welcome to Swindon."""
00:06:22,00:06:23,The swindon was tiny.
00:06:23,00:06:26,"It was absolutely tiny before the railway arrived, and then it became huge."
00:06:26,00:06:29,"So there's another town that's sort of further south in what it's called, Mulbra."
00:06:29,00:06:33,"And it's absolutely tiny, but it could as easily have gone the other way."
00:06:33,00:06:36,"And if it isn't about King Dubin-Elford, you know, been a bit hungry, or had not a banana"
00:06:36,00:06:40,"or breakfast, and he wanted a bit more of his sandwich."
00:06:40,00:06:43,So ham sandwiches are still extremely popular.
00:06:43,00:06:44,"Oh, right."
00:06:44,00:06:45,Yeah.
00:06:45,00:06:50,The British Sandwich Association says that ham sandwiches is the most popular sandwich in
00:06:50,00:06:51,the UK.
00:06:51,00:06:52,Really?
00:06:52,00:06:55,Do you think they'll look back in 100 years at 2016 and think it was a great age of ham
00:06:55,00:06:56,sandwiches as well?
00:06:56,00:07:00,"I think finally, back to the great times of 1851."
00:07:00,00:07:01,So this is an old survey.
00:07:01,00:07:02,I can't imagine though.
00:07:02,00:07:06,"In 2001, I can't imagine, in 15 years, it's changed that much."
00:07:06,00:07:10,But they said that the favourite filling wasn't ham though.
00:07:10,00:07:13,"It was cheese, but a ham sandwich on its own taught."
00:07:13,00:07:14,But the favourite filling.
00:07:14,00:07:15,Yeah.
00:07:15,00:07:18,"I always like my ham sandwiches without ham, but with cheese."
00:07:18,00:07:19,Yeah.
00:07:19,00:07:22,I think what they mean is what's your favourite filling?
00:07:22,00:07:24,"Well, if I'm having a sandwich, I love it if there's cheese in there."
00:07:24,00:07:27,"And they said, ""Would you be happy with just a cheese sandwich?"""
00:07:27,00:07:28,"No, no."
00:07:28,00:07:29,I think I'll go for ham.
00:07:29,00:07:30,I think that's how the conversation works.
00:07:30,00:07:31,Wait.
00:07:31,00:07:33,Is that because you have it outside the sandwich?
00:07:33,00:07:36,"No, you have it in the sandwich, but you might have it with ham, so you have a ham and cheese"
00:07:36,00:07:37,sandwich.
00:07:37,00:07:40,So you're saying ham is not a filling because it's the base ingredient of the sandwich.
00:07:40,00:07:41,No.
00:07:41,00:07:42,If anything extra is a filling?
00:07:42,00:07:43,"No, no."
00:07:43,00:07:44,There's two questions.
00:07:44,00:07:45,What is this bread-added item in it?
00:07:45,00:07:46,Yeah.
00:07:46,00:07:47,And you could have at least one item in it.
00:07:47,00:07:48,They've gone for ham sandwich.
00:07:48,00:07:49,That works best as a sandwich.
00:07:49,00:07:50,Yeah.
00:07:50,00:07:52,What's your favourite filling to go in a sandwich?
00:07:52,00:07:53,"Oh, okay."
00:07:53,00:07:56,"Well, if I'm having a ham sandwich, rather than pickle, I'll have cheese."
00:07:56,00:07:57,Cheese is the favourite added on.
00:07:57,00:08:01,What's your favourite filling for two slices of bread is ham?
00:08:01,00:08:02,Yeah.
00:08:02,00:08:06,"Of all the things that people have voted on in 2016, this makes me the most annoyed."
00:08:06,00:08:11,"Well, this is 2001, people say 2016 to shit you."
00:08:11,00:08:16,Imagine you were presented with a lot of different sandwiches that had base meats in
00:08:16,00:08:17,them.
00:08:17,00:08:18,Right?
00:08:18,00:08:20,"Let's say, or no meat, or like a salad or whatever."
00:08:20,00:08:21,Base meat.
00:08:21,00:08:23,Like the alchemy of the sandwich.
00:08:23,00:08:24,There's base 10.
00:08:24,00:08:28,And then base meat to which is what our sandwiches are based on.
00:08:28,00:08:33,Turned ham into cheese.
00:08:33,00:08:38,Two thirds of ham and cheese pizzas tested by trading standards officers in Derbyshire
00:08:38,00:08:40,failed to contain ham or cheese.
00:08:40,00:08:41,No.
00:08:41,00:08:42,Yeah.
00:08:42,00:08:43,How many?
00:08:43,00:08:44,Two thirds.
00:08:44,00:08:45,Two thirds of the pizza.
00:08:45,00:08:47,"Oh, my God."
00:08:47,00:08:51,"What it was is when people thought it was ham, it was actually turkey ham, which is"
00:08:51,00:08:55,"made of turkey not ham, and the cheese was often cheese substitutes."
00:08:55,00:08:59,"I'm not sure what cheese substitute is, but it doesn't sound great."
00:08:59,00:09:02,"Well, ham apparently."
00:09:02,00:09:09,"So Henry Mayhew did a load of, just to drag us back to Henry Mayhew for a bit."
00:09:09,00:09:11,"He did a load of calculations, basically."
00:09:11,00:09:14,So he calculated how many sellers there were of each thing on the streets of London.
00:09:14,00:09:19,"So he calculated, for example, that there were 60 ham sandwich sellers in London, 200"
00:09:19,00:09:25,"baked potatoes sellers, 300 people who sell pea, soup and hot eel, six people apparently"
00:09:25,00:09:27,specialised in plum puddings.
00:09:27,00:09:28,Yeah.
00:09:28,00:09:32,And he would work it out by estimating the number of miles of street in the city and then multiplying
00:09:32,00:09:35,that by the number of traders he found per mile.
00:09:35,00:09:36,Yeah.
00:09:36,00:09:38,I think it sounds like the most fascinating book.
00:09:38,00:09:39,I really want to read it.
00:09:39,00:09:40,It's what's it called again?
00:09:40,00:09:42,It's called London Leibat and the London poor.
00:09:42,00:09:43,Yeah.
00:09:43,00:09:48,"And he basically documented 1851 in London, in down to every bit of clothing that people,"
00:09:48,00:09:51,it would be like us just going out on the street and just recording what's going on as a time
00:09:51,00:09:52,capsule.
00:09:52,00:09:53,And it's pretty amazing work.
00:09:53,00:09:54,That'd be comprehensive.
00:09:54,00:09:55,Really?
00:09:55,00:09:56,Yeah.
00:09:56,00:09:57,That's a big impact.
00:09:57,00:10:01,"He pissed off a lot of people with this book, particularly the street traders."
00:10:01,00:10:06,And they actually set up a street trader's protection association against this kind of
00:10:06,00:10:10,"journalism, specifically because how they were presented in the book."
00:10:10,00:10:13,"They were presented like these sandwich sellers, they're like, well, actually we do have"
00:10:13,00:10:14,a bit more than ham.
00:10:14,00:10:18,"Yeah, exactly."
00:10:18,00:10:19,Really?
00:10:19,00:10:20,Yeah.
00:10:20,00:10:21,Some of the sandwiches didn't even have ham in.
00:10:21,00:10:22,Did they not?
00:10:22,00:10:23,No.
00:10:23,00:10:24,Just cheese.
00:10:24,00:10:27,"They had a bit of beef dripping and that was it, between two bits of bread."
00:10:27,00:10:28,What is beef dripping?
00:10:28,00:10:29,It's fat.
00:10:29,00:10:30,Yeah.
00:10:30,00:10:31,Sort of.
00:10:31,00:10:32,It's a congeal fat.
00:10:32,00:10:36,"When you've caught beef, you get all the fat kind of drops down when you roast it."
00:10:36,00:10:40,And then you can take that and you can kind of spread it on bread and it's what people
00:10:40,00:10:41,used to eat.
00:10:41,00:10:42,That sounds like cheese substitute.
00:10:42,00:10:47,"It does, but it doesn't taste anything like cheese, it tastes more like kind of fatty gravy."
00:10:47,00:10:49,"Oh, so delicious."
00:10:49,00:10:53,"Also, he collected a load of data with his brother Augustus Mayhew and yet 20 years after"
00:10:53,00:10:58,"the book was published, Augustus Mayhew has had up in court on charges of attacking a"
00:10:58,00:11:01,female peddler or woman going on selling things.
00:11:01,00:11:02,Really?
00:11:02,00:11:06,And his defense in court was that people would knock on his door up to 38 times a day selling
00:11:06,00:11:07,things.
00:11:07,00:11:14,He just snapped and he said there were shouting things like crockery or fine young rabbits
00:11:14,00:11:17,"or roots all are blowing, all are growing."
00:11:17,00:11:21,Fine young rabbits sounds like a great band doesn't he?
00:11:21,00:11:22,Yeah.
00:11:22,00:11:27,Did you know that there's a latitude around the earth that's sometimes referred to as the
00:11:27,00:11:32,"ham belt and it's 40 degrees latitude and it's not so much these days, but it used to"
00:11:32,00:11:35,be the climates at which all the best ham came from.
00:11:35,00:11:40,"So like Kentucky ham, Virginia ham, Italian, prosciutto ham, Spanish, Serrano ham, all"
00:11:40,00:11:43,"of those places are along the same last student, it's because the climate is sort of ideal"
00:11:43,00:11:47,"for ham curing and it's not so important nowadays because you know, you have climate control"
00:11:47,00:11:48,factors and whatnot.
00:11:48,00:11:49,Yeah.
00:11:49,00:11:53,And it was discovered by Alexander von Humbel.
00:11:53,00:12:01,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Alex."
00:12:01,00:12:07,"My fact is that since 2003, the UK has eaten one and a half million pounds in cash."
00:12:07,00:12:08,Okay.
00:12:08,00:12:15,"And when he said cash, are we talking 2P coins or notes, so this is the bank of England releases"
00:12:15,00:12:22,"stats every year on the, yeah, the graph, Alex got a massive graph on his research notes."
00:12:22,00:12:26,"So for people at home, what happens is we kind of do some research and we print it out"
00:12:26,00:12:30,on a sheet of paper and we've got like little paragraphs that we might read out if something
00:12:30,00:12:33,"comes up, but Alex just has a massive graph."
00:12:33,00:12:36,I'm concerned by the year to year trends and I'm going to explain.
00:12:36,00:12:41,You can submit bank notes that are damaged in some way to the bank of England to get them
00:12:41,00:12:42,replaced.
00:12:42,00:12:43,Okay.
00:12:43,00:12:44,And then they keep stats on them.
00:12:44,00:12:45,So they release each year.
00:12:45,00:12:51,How many bank notes have been torn apart or accidentally washed or contaminated or damaged
00:12:51,00:12:52,by fire or flood?
00:12:52,00:12:54,And the other category is chewed or eaten.
00:12:54,00:12:55,Okay.
00:12:55,00:13:00,"So they've released how many, how many notes of each domination have been chewed or eaten"
00:13:00,00:13:03,and how much they're worth.
00:13:03,00:13:06,"And in total, since 2003, it's 1.5 million."
00:13:06,00:13:07,Okay.
00:13:07,00:13:11,"So I reckon when you said that fact, people were thinking that humans were eating these notes,"
00:13:11,00:13:13,but I reckon it must be mostly like dogs and stuff.
00:13:13,00:13:14,"Maybe, yeah."
00:13:14,00:13:15,It could be babies.
00:13:15,00:13:16,It could be babies.
00:13:16,00:13:17,Yeah.
00:13:17,00:13:18,"I mean, babies will put things in their mouths, wouldn't they?"
00:13:18,00:13:21,"They will, but they don't have teeth."
00:13:21,00:13:22,That's true.
00:13:22,00:13:24,So they won't be chewing it and damaging it.
00:13:24,00:13:25,"I mean, some of them have teeth, don't they?"
00:13:25,00:13:27,Do you have to have teeth to chew?
00:13:27,00:13:28,That's a good part of that.
00:13:28,00:13:30,Can you chew with gums alone?
00:13:30,00:13:34,You could suppose you could ruminate the note in your mouth so you could dissolve it.
00:13:34,00:13:35,Yeah.
00:13:35,00:13:37,I'd say a baby would be sucking rather than chewing.
00:13:37,00:13:38,Yeah.
00:13:38,00:13:39,Okay.
00:13:39,00:13:44,"Well, but you have to provide the remnants of the note to prove that you had it in the"
00:13:44,00:13:45,first place.
00:13:45,00:13:46,"In other words, you can just write it back and then say, ""How do you, so what, you bring"
00:13:46,00:13:47,"the dog?"""
00:13:47,00:13:50,So you bring the left of you to eat it.
00:13:50,00:13:53,"So there could be plenty of notes that have been completely eaten, I guess."
00:13:53,00:13:54,It's very hard to say.
00:13:54,00:13:57,"My dog ate 2,000 quid in 50 pound notes."
00:13:57,00:14:01,"Unfortunately, he ate them so thoroughly, but if you could tell me, ""No, but they do send"
00:14:01,00:14:02,this.
00:14:02,00:14:03,"I recommend it."""
00:14:03,00:14:05,It's called the mutilator's notes service and you post them in and you write a little
00:14:05,00:14:06,explaining that.
00:14:06,00:14:09,"And if they think it's legit, then they'll post you some money."
00:14:09,00:14:11,I could have used that.
00:14:11,00:14:16,I once got given an envelope of some money and you've been paid it for asking those questions
00:14:16,00:14:17,in the house.
00:14:17,00:14:18,A comment.
00:14:18,00:14:25,"That's an excellent satire from the early 2000s, thank you."
00:14:25,00:14:29,"It's 19s actually, that's it."
00:14:29,00:14:32,"The rest of you can look that up at home and have a really entertaining, cash for questions."
00:14:32,00:14:35,"Anyway, sorry, go on, go on, done."
00:14:35,00:14:39,"So rather than opening the envelope the normal way, I opened it up at the top end of the,"
00:14:39,00:14:40,on the side.
00:14:40,00:14:41,So I just ripped it open.
00:14:41,00:14:42,The short edge of the envelope.
00:14:42,00:14:43,"Yes, exactly."
00:14:43,00:14:46,"So I ripped it open there and I, and then I got to the shop and it was closed and so I"
00:14:46,00:14:47,couldn't buy anything.
00:14:47,00:14:52,"And to my house came out in the morning to buy the milk that I was looking to buy, handed"
00:14:52,00:14:55,"over from the envelope my £10 note and the guy said, I can't accept this."
00:14:55,00:14:59,You're missing the last like eighth of the note.
00:14:59,00:15:03,"And what I had done, and there was about 60 quid in this envelope, I had ripped as well"
00:15:03,00:15:08,"as the envelope, all that final eighth of all the notes."
00:15:08,00:15:11,And they had scattered all on the street and had to go around the street collecting the
00:15:11,00:15:12,rest of my notes.
00:15:12,00:15:13,"Yeah, I found them."
00:15:13,00:15:14,They were all day afterwards.
00:15:14,00:15:15,Yeah.
00:15:15,00:15:16,Oh my god.
00:15:16,00:15:17,Did you get the milk?
00:15:17,00:15:18,Yeah.
00:15:18,00:15:19,Right.
00:15:19,00:15:25,"I think that all of these banknotes were mostly eaten by dogs, not humans or babies, well, babies"
00:15:25,00:15:29,"are humans, apart from baby dogs."
00:15:29,00:15:32,So I think they're mostly eaten by dogs.
00:15:32,00:15:37,"In Montana, a few years ago, there was a new story about a dog called Sundance, who ate"
00:15:37,00:15:43,five $100 bills that were stashed in his owner's little cubby hole.
00:15:43,00:15:48,"But the five hundred dollar bills were together with a single one dollar bill, which it didn't"
00:15:48,00:15:49,eat.
00:15:49,00:15:53,That's fantastic.
00:15:53,00:15:54,Wow.
00:15:54,00:15:55,This is interesting.
00:15:55,00:16:00,Do you know where the first place to feature Queen Elizabeth on money was?
00:16:00,00:16:01,Oh.
00:16:01,00:16:02,So not Britain.
00:16:02,00:16:03,It was not Britain.
00:16:03,00:16:04,It was not Britain.
00:16:04,00:16:05,Yeah.
00:16:05,00:16:06,Was it somewhere in the Caribbean?
00:16:06,00:16:07,No.
00:16:07,00:16:08,Somewhere in Africa.
00:16:08,00:16:09,No.
00:16:09,00:16:10,Australia?
00:16:10,00:16:11,No.
00:16:11,00:16:12,Canada.
00:16:12,00:16:13,Yes.
00:16:13,00:16:19,"I had her when she was a nine-year-old princess, so prior to being the Queen, and it was on"
00:16:19,00:16:20,their $20 notes.
00:16:20,00:16:22,"And so, obviously, she wasn't on any money here."
00:16:22,00:16:23,She wasn't the Queen yet.
00:16:23,00:16:27,But they wanted to give her some props over there.
00:16:27,00:16:30,"I'm not sure completely why, but they used her image."
00:16:30,00:16:31,Yeah.
00:16:31,00:16:36,"Speaking of notes in Canada, a few years ago, there was a rumor that all Canadian banknotes"
00:16:36,00:16:42,"smelled of maple syrup, and people were kind of pulling them out of their pockets and"
00:16:42,00:16:46,"smelling them, and believed that they could smell maple syrup, and everyone on the internet"
00:16:46,00:16:50,"was saying, ""Yeah, my smell of maple syrup as well, but mine only smell of it when I take"
00:16:50,00:16:53,"them out, my pocket, and they've warmed up, so there must be something in the note."""
00:16:53,00:16:56,"And the pocket I keep on wearing maple syrup in, yeah."
00:16:56,00:17:00,"Well, I think that must have been it, or it was just like a weird hysteria, because the"
00:17:00,00:17:04,"Bank of Canada said that actually there's nothing in there, and we've tested ours, and"
00:17:04,00:17:06,they don't smell a maple syrup.
00:17:06,00:17:09,"But they have got in trouble in the past as well, the Bank of Canada, because they did"
00:17:09,00:17:13,"a new series of banknotes, and they put a maple leaf on, and it was pointed out that that"
00:17:13,00:17:17,"maple leaf, that particular shape of maple leaf, is from a tree which does not grow in Canada."
00:17:17,00:17:18,That's right.
00:17:18,00:17:22,"And they said, ""No, weogen maple, raft, and the Canadian maple,"" and they said, ""Actually,"
00:17:22,00:17:25,what we've done is we've blended together a load of maple leaves to avoid being regionally
00:17:25,00:17:26,"insensitive."""
00:17:26,00:17:33,"Well, that's kind of like the Euro, though, because when they designed the Euro notes,"
00:17:33,00:17:37,"they didn't want to favor any particular country-used culture, so they got someone to take"
00:17:37,00:17:41,"a load of famous bridges from all the different countries that were taking the Euro, and sort"
00:17:41,00:17:43,of blend them into generic bridges that they got made up of.
00:17:43,00:17:48,"Yeah, so all the Euro money has fake bridges on it, so then when they found out it started"
00:17:48,00:17:51,"building those bridges, it was an art installation rather than an actual bridge, but then he started"
00:17:51,00:17:53,building the fake bridges over rivers in Belgium or something.
00:17:53,00:17:54,That's a great idea.
00:17:54,00:17:55,Yeah.
00:17:55,00:17:56,That's fantastic.
00:17:56,00:17:59,"For the odd, weird, reverse, forgery, but not money."
00:17:59,00:18:00,Yeah.
00:18:00,00:18:02,"Oh, this is a cool thing about currency."
00:18:02,00:18:09,"So in, I think it was November or October, the Japanese financial services industry was"
00:18:09,00:18:16,"considering regulating a new kind of currency, which was, and he guesses, ""It's currency that"
00:18:16,00:18:18,"James spends, and the rest of us don't."""
00:18:18,00:18:19,"Oh, come on, money."
00:18:19,00:18:21,It's Pokecoins.
00:18:21,00:18:26,"So as far as I understand, you use the currency to breed imaginary monsters on your phone."
00:18:26,00:18:30,"You use them to not buy monsters, but buy things that help you to find monsters."
00:18:30,00:18:31,I see.
00:18:31,00:18:33,"Okay, so you can't even buy Pokemon with them."
00:18:33,00:18:34,You can buy--
00:18:34,00:18:35,No.
00:18:35,00:18:36,"Well, you've got to catch Pokemon."
00:18:36,00:18:37,Yeah.
00:18:37,00:18:38,So it's like you can buy a net with a Pokecoins.
00:18:38,00:18:39,Kind of.
00:18:39,00:18:40,You can buy a lure.
00:18:40,00:18:41,That's spending real money on that.
00:18:41,00:18:44,You can spend real money or you can find them in the game.
00:18:44,00:18:45,Okay.
00:18:45,00:18:46,So--
00:18:46,00:18:50,"But we all do it, like Temple Run, you know, when you spend money to buy more speedability and"
00:18:50,00:18:51,so on.
00:18:51,00:18:52,"We all do it, Andy."
00:18:52,00:18:53,We all do it.
00:18:53,00:18:54,Okay.
00:18:54,00:18:57,"The Japanese financial services authority is not considering regulating Temple Run coins,"
00:18:57,00:18:58,though.
00:18:58,00:18:59,We are considering regulating--
00:18:59,00:19:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:03,00:19:05,"And basically, if they did decide to regulate it, I don't think--"
00:19:05,00:19:07,I'm not sure if they'd come to a conclusion.
00:19:07,00:19:11,"Yeah, companies would have to declare all the unused currency that gamers have held."
00:19:11,00:19:14,And they'd have to secure it with massive deposits of real money.
00:19:14,00:19:15,Wow.
00:19:15,00:19:16,It's really interesting.
00:19:16,00:19:22,"Speaking of digital money, there's a landfill in Wales, which has an enormous treasure trove."
00:19:22,00:19:23,"Like, I heard it buried treasure."
00:19:23,00:19:25,And it's getting more and more valuable each year.
00:19:25,00:19:27,"So, in 2013, it was worth 4 million pounds."
00:19:27,00:19:33,"And it's because there's a hard drive, which a man called James Howell threw away in 2013."
00:19:33,00:19:36,"And he realized, after he thrown it away, that he had a digital wallet on it, which had"
00:19:36,00:19:38,"$7,500 Bitcoin."
00:19:38,00:19:41,"And he got those in 2009, when they were worth nothing."
00:19:41,00:19:45,"But they now, worth 13, they're worth about 4 million pounds, and they're increasing a"
00:19:45,00:19:46,lot more since then.
00:19:46,00:19:47,And so we don't know where it is in the--
00:19:47,00:19:48,"Somewhere out of it, yeah."
00:19:48,00:19:49,Right.
00:19:49,00:19:50,"Yeah, so, yeah."
00:19:50,00:19:51,Get big.
00:19:51,00:19:52,Should we move on soon?
00:19:52,00:19:53,Yeah.
00:19:53,00:19:56,I have one thing that Motorola has invented an edible password.
00:19:56,00:19:58,They call it an authentication vitamin.
00:19:58,00:19:59,And it's a pill that you swallow.
00:19:59,00:20:02,"And if you have your phone, you're a wirelessly unlock it."
00:20:02,00:20:03,Sorry.
00:20:03,00:20:04,I'm a bit confused on how it works.
00:20:04,00:20:05,"So, you swallow a pill."
00:20:05,00:20:09,"You swallow a pill that has a tiny microchip in it, which broadcasts a little signal."
00:20:09,00:20:13,And that's a signal that wirelessly unlock your devices if they're set up for it.
00:20:13,00:20:15,So is it activated by the actors following it?
00:20:15,00:20:16,"No, no."
00:20:16,00:20:17,You don't have to swallow it every time you don't have a phone.
00:20:17,00:20:18,You put it in you.
00:20:18,00:20:20,"And then when you're around your phone, it's unlocked."
00:20:20,00:20:22,But except for when you put it out.
00:20:22,00:20:23,Yeah.
00:20:23,00:20:24,So then you have to swallow another one.
00:20:24,00:20:29,"You have to have it in your pocket, because you could lose that, or someone else could..."
00:20:29,00:20:30,Take pocket you?
00:20:30,00:20:31,Yeah.
00:20:31,00:20:33,Whereas you can't have it stolen from you if you beat it.
00:20:33,00:20:37,"So, what you could do is you could put the little chip that's in a nice card, and you"
00:20:37,00:20:38,could eat that.
00:20:38,00:20:43,"And then every time you're walking towards the gates and the tube station, it'll be like"
00:20:43,00:20:44,you're on Star Wars or something.
00:20:44,00:20:45,Yeah.
00:20:45,00:20:53,"And that is why, my Lord, I took a dump, or it was to bury it."
00:20:53,00:20:54,Okay.
00:20:54,00:20:56,It is time to move on to fact number three.
00:20:56,00:20:58,And that is my fact.
00:20:58,00:21:05,And my fact this week is that a day on the sun lasts both 25 and 38 Earth days.
00:21:05,00:21:06,Okay.
00:21:06,00:21:11,"You have to explain, because it's always going to feel like daytime there, isn't it?"
00:21:11,00:21:12,Yeah.
00:21:12,00:21:13,It's not really going to...
00:21:13,00:21:14,Yeah.
00:21:14,00:21:15,You're going to be confused.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"So, because it's a massive gas body, it spins at different speeds."
00:21:17,00:21:23,"So the middle of it, the equator, as it were, spins around 25 days."
00:21:23,00:21:25,"That makes one day's, but the poles go a lot slower."
00:21:25,00:21:28,So it takes up to 38 days for them to turn around.
00:21:28,00:21:33,"So I should say that there are fluctuations in these numbers, obviously."
00:21:33,00:21:37,"So 24.7 is usually the number given for the quickest bit where the equator, where the middle"
00:21:37,00:21:38,of the sun is spinning around.
00:21:38,00:21:40,38 is the top end bit.
00:21:40,00:21:44,"By asked Alex and I saw an astrophysicist the other night, Dr. Lucy Green."
00:21:44,00:21:48,And she said that's absolutely true that they do have these different spins on them.
00:21:48,00:21:49,Yeah.
00:21:49,00:21:50,Really interesting.
00:21:50,00:21:54,"Actually, they also have differentials spin, because they're gas."
00:21:54,00:21:55,Yeah.
00:21:55,00:21:59,"I found out this thing the other day, which I told the guys, but I haven't told you yet."
00:21:59,00:22:02,So I'll ask you as a question.
00:22:02,00:22:05,So let's assume that there are eight planets in the solar system.
00:22:05,00:22:06,Yeah.
00:22:06,00:22:08,How many planets in our solar system orbit the sun?
00:22:08,00:22:10,"Of those eight, all of them."
00:22:10,00:22:15,"Ah, technically, if you go into a super technical reasoning, we orbit the sun because"
00:22:15,00:22:18,"at the center of the gravity that's pulling us, making us orbit the sun, is in the middle"
00:22:18,00:22:19,of the sun.
00:22:19,00:22:24,"Jupiter is so large, it's so big that it's pulled the center of gravity out to above the"
00:22:24,00:22:26,sun's surface.
00:22:26,00:22:28,"So technically, they are orbiting each other."
00:22:28,00:22:29,That's really good.
00:22:29,00:22:30,"Yeah, it's quite cool."
00:22:30,00:22:32,I had no idea Jupiter was that big.
00:22:32,00:22:34,"It also has a massively fast day, Jupiter."
00:22:34,00:22:35,Does it?
00:22:35,00:22:39,"So yeah, it rotates every 10 hours."
00:22:39,00:22:41,"So daytime, nighttime, you just lost about five hours."
00:22:41,00:22:42,Oh.
00:22:42,00:22:43,She's really short.
00:22:43,00:22:45,It's faster than any other planet.
00:22:45,00:22:49,"And if it was 80 times larger, which is not that much larger, it could have been a star,"
00:22:49,00:22:50,a star.
00:22:50,00:22:51,Wow.
00:22:51,00:22:52,Yeah.
00:22:52,00:22:53,"Well, we're done to us."
00:22:53,00:22:54,"Oh, I think we've been in big trouble."
00:22:54,00:22:55,"Yeah, issues, right?"
00:22:55,00:22:56,Probably.
00:22:56,00:23:01,"Hey, so I found this fact when I was reading a book called The Jupiter Effect, which is"
00:23:01,00:23:06,"written by John Ribbon, who most people know is a massive popular science writer."
00:23:06,00:23:08,"He wrote in ""Search a Shrodinger's Cat."""
00:23:08,00:23:11,And this book is the one book that he wants people to forget about.
00:23:11,00:23:12,So I apologize.
00:23:12,00:23:14,"I'm glad because you've met John Ribbon, haven't you?"
00:23:14,00:23:15,I have.
00:23:15,00:23:16,Yeah.
00:23:16,00:23:17,He'll be delighted that you're bringing this up.
00:23:17,00:23:18,Yeah.
00:23:18,00:23:19,"I'm really sorry, but it is out there."
00:23:19,00:23:23,"And it's a really well written book, except for one thing, which it has a conceit of it, which"
00:23:23,00:23:28,is that basically there was going to be a ginormous earthquake at the San Andreas fault on March
00:23:28,00:23:33,"the 10th of 1982, because they believe that all the planets were going to align, and it"
00:23:33,00:23:36,"was just going to set off chaos on Earth, which never happened."
00:23:36,00:23:38,"It was a bestseller, though, but it didn't happen."
00:23:38,00:23:43,And so he's kind of buried that book by writing about 200 more books to separate itself.
00:23:43,00:23:45,I'm sure he writes tons of books.
00:23:45,00:23:46,I think they're all brilliant.
00:23:46,00:23:47,They're all brilliant.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"But yeah, do you think that's the reason he writes so many?"
00:23:49,00:23:52,I think just so it goes co-order down that bibliography list.
00:23:52,00:23:53,Yeah.
00:23:53,00:23:55,I'm just going back to the sun very quickly.
00:23:55,00:23:56,Yes.
00:23:56,00:23:58,What would happen if you replaced the sun with a black hole?
00:23:58,00:24:01,So there'd be less light for starters.
00:24:01,00:24:04,There'd be less energy coming from it.
00:24:04,00:24:05,You would think?
00:24:05,00:24:06,Yes.
00:24:06,00:24:08,So it off-freeze to death.
00:24:08,00:24:10,"And we would get sucked into it, because that's..."
00:24:10,00:24:11,No.
00:24:11,00:24:12,There we are.
00:24:12,00:24:13,That's finally the thing.
00:24:13,00:24:14,"No, apparently."
00:24:14,00:24:16,So the Oxford University Science Blog looks into this.
00:24:16,00:24:20,"And they found that apparently the planet's orbits would stay kind of much the same, because"
00:24:20,00:24:24,"if it's the same mass as the sun, this black hole, then the gravitational field it produces"
00:24:24,00:24:26,is about the same as the sun.
00:24:26,00:24:29,But it would be cold and dark.
00:24:29,00:24:33,"The sun is obviously emitting loads of heat, but Jupiter, it was all my Jupiter."
00:24:33,00:24:37,"Jupiter radiates so much heat, but it loses it faster than it gains energy from the sun,"
00:24:37,00:24:40,which means that it's shrinking about two centimeters a year.
00:24:40,00:24:41,That is a year?
00:24:41,00:24:42,Yeah.
00:24:42,00:24:43,Two centimeters a year.
00:24:43,00:24:44,"I mean, it's massive."
00:24:44,00:24:45,So that's relatively quite small amount.
00:24:45,00:24:46,Yeah.
00:24:46,00:24:52,"Are there planets out there that we've seen exoplanet style that would be just enough atmosphere,"
00:24:52,00:24:57,"tall enough that a six-foot person could stand in and sort of like run their life, but that's"
00:24:57,00:24:58,where the planet ends.
00:24:58,00:24:59,"Well, the only atmosphere."
00:24:59,00:25:00,Yeah.
00:25:00,00:25:06,"So if you were to go to, I think it's Mars, they have a very, very, very weak atmosphere."
00:25:06,00:25:11,"And so it would kind of feel like winter at your head, but spring at your feet."
00:25:11,00:25:12,Wow.
00:25:12,00:25:13,Yeah.
00:25:13,00:25:16,"So you kind of, your head would be out of the atmosphere, kind of."
00:25:16,00:25:20,"So you have to, what do you have to, where do you spend Christmas?"
00:25:20,00:25:25,"Do you have to go up a step ladder, basically, for Christmas, and then for the spring?"
00:25:25,00:25:27,So much just lie on the floor.
00:25:27,00:25:28,"Some are collection, just lie down."
00:25:28,00:25:29,I have one more.
00:25:29,00:25:31,Do you know what else is fueled by the sun?
00:25:31,00:25:34,"Superman, according to DC Comics."
00:25:34,00:25:35,Really?
00:25:35,00:25:38,"No, this, because once he was bitten by Dracula and Dracula exploded."
00:25:38,00:25:39,What?
00:25:39,00:25:40,"Science, guys."
00:25:40,00:25:44,I've never caught up with a brand stoker novel.
00:25:44,00:25:49,"Wait, hang on, Dracula bites Superman, though, Superman explodes."
00:25:49,00:25:52,"No, Dracula explodes, because Dracula vampires don't like sunlight."
00:25:52,00:25:54,How do we know Superman isn't made out of garlic?
00:25:54,00:25:56,"No, it's sweet."
00:25:56,00:26:04,"Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show."
00:26:04,00:26:05,And that is James.
00:26:05,00:26:12,"Okay, my fact this week is that in 1945, police in Halifax Nova Scotia initiated a campaign"
00:26:12,00:26:19,to stop people from beeping their carhons in Moscow to signal out vial and filthy language.
00:26:19,00:26:22,And what were they saying in the Moscow?
00:26:22,00:26:23,Do we know?
00:26:23,00:26:24,"This is the weird thing, right?"
00:26:24,00:26:28,"So I saw this on a website called Boing Boing, which is one of my favourite places online."
00:26:28,00:26:31,They have amazing facts and stuff like that on there.
00:26:31,00:26:33,And it was a news cutting.
00:26:33,00:26:37,"And I'm pretty sure the news cutting is real, because I found it in other places."
00:26:37,00:26:42,But that's the only thing on the whole of the internet that seems to give any idea that
00:26:42,00:26:43,this actually happened.
00:26:43,00:26:47,"Now I see why you were throwing shade at my ham sandwich, in fact, you were drawn attention"
00:26:47,00:26:48,from your own.
00:26:48,00:26:55,"Yeah, fair enough, I don't know if it's true if anyone knows any more than do let us know."
00:26:55,00:26:58,"But I think it's a really, it's a nice idea if it's not true, right?"
00:26:58,00:26:59,Yeah.
00:26:59,00:27:03,I think it's the most eloquent way to swear at someone through Moscow.
00:27:03,00:27:04,It takes a long time.
00:27:04,00:27:05,It takes a very long time.
00:27:05,00:27:06,"Oh, you're a dick."
00:27:06,00:27:07,"Kind of, yeah."
00:27:07,00:27:08,Yeah.
00:27:08,00:27:09,"If you're in traffic though, you do have time."
00:27:09,00:27:10,So you might as well send a message.
00:27:10,00:27:11,That's true.
00:27:11,00:27:12,Yeah.
00:27:12,00:27:15,You're relying on the person who is a dick knowing Moscow.
00:27:15,00:27:16,Yeah.
00:27:16,00:27:17,Yeah.
00:27:17,00:27:20,"It's quite funny, because it does sound like you're actually just bleeping yourself as you're"
00:27:20,00:27:23,swearing at someone.
00:27:23,00:27:25,So this is 1945.
00:27:25,00:27:26,That's right.
00:27:26,00:27:28,What kind of carhons were we at that point?
00:27:28,00:27:30,What kind of cars were we at at that point?
00:27:30,00:27:36,"Well, we would have had cars that are not a million miles dissimilar to cars that we"
00:27:36,00:27:38,"have now, their combustion engines."
00:27:38,00:27:41,"So maybe slightly bigger American cars, that kind of thing?"
00:27:41,00:27:42,Yeah.
00:27:42,00:27:43,So the 50s is where I start.
00:27:43,00:27:44,"So the clock, what a car is."
00:27:44,00:27:45,Okay.
00:27:45,00:27:46,So imagine five years before that.
00:27:46,00:27:47,"Yeah, I got it there."
00:27:47,00:27:54,"But they've had horns, like a horn sound, since the very beginning of things with wheels"
00:27:54,00:27:55,"on the road, haven't they?"
00:27:55,00:27:56,Yeah.
00:27:56,00:27:57,So they predate cars.
00:27:57,00:28:00,"So they weren't they originally outside the cars, and people like walk alongside carriages"
00:28:00,00:28:03,"with horns, or they'd walk alongside cars with horns."
00:28:03,00:28:04,What did you do?
00:28:04,00:28:05,"If you were just walking, you had a, you had a horse."
00:28:05,00:28:08,"Yes, I've heard, yeah, I've read this as well."
00:28:08,00:28:09,Yeah.
00:28:09,00:28:13,"Pedestrians carried the first carhons to warn cars, and then eventually they said, why do"
00:28:13,00:28:14,we combine this with the car?
00:28:14,00:28:19,"I read that there was an early locomotive act, and the idea was that cars used to travel"
00:28:19,00:28:23,"really slowly, and to warn people that cars were on the way."
00:28:23,00:28:25,Someone would walk ahead of the car with a red flag.
00:28:25,00:28:26,Okay.
00:28:26,00:28:27,Was everything about this?
00:28:27,00:28:28,"Yeah, is it true?"
00:28:28,00:28:29,Is it true?
00:28:29,00:28:30,Not really.
00:28:30,00:28:31,Okay.
00:28:31,00:28:32,It's true that the act existed.
00:28:32,00:28:33,The act existed.
00:28:33,00:28:34,Yep.
00:28:34,00:28:39,"And the red flag thing was used, and you would have to have three people operating a vehicle,"
00:28:39,00:28:44,"one to steer it, one to stoke the boiler, and one to walk ahead who was called the stalker"
00:28:44,00:28:45,with the red flag.
00:28:45,00:28:46,Yep.
00:28:46,00:28:51,"However, I think that when the act was introduced, cars were not a thing, because it was"
00:28:51,00:28:57,"in about the 1870s, and by the time people started having personal cars, the red flag bit"
00:28:57,00:28:59,was not observed and have been repealed.
00:28:59,00:29:00,Okay.
00:29:00,00:29:01,From memory.
00:29:01,00:29:02,Yeah.
00:29:02,00:29:03,That's how it went.
00:29:03,00:29:04,"So, yeah."
00:29:04,00:29:10,"I was looking online about sometimes in Moore's code, you know, how on text messages, you"
00:29:10,00:29:11,"know, lol for a laugh out loud."
00:29:11,00:29:16,There's a long list of how they do abbreviations for longer sentences.
00:29:16,00:29:21,"So one of my favorite ones, and this is goodbye, so I want to see who gets this."
00:29:21,00:29:25,"If you were doing a shortened Moore's code of goodbye, it's DSW."
00:29:25,00:29:26,Why would it be DSW?
00:29:26,00:29:27,Don't?
00:29:27,00:29:28,Darling?
00:29:28,00:29:29,What?
00:29:29,00:29:30,"No, DSW."
00:29:30,00:29:31,"Oh, you were doing DSW."
00:29:31,00:29:32,You were doing that for three words?
00:29:32,00:29:33,"No, it doesn't actually."
00:29:33,00:29:34,Oh.
00:29:34,00:29:35,Then I'm not going to know it.
00:29:35,00:29:36,DSW.
00:29:36,00:29:40,"I would have thought I would have gone for CU, because that would be shorter."
00:29:40,00:29:41,"Yes, it would have been."
00:29:41,00:29:42,Yeah.
00:29:42,00:29:43,So what's DSW?
00:29:43,00:29:44,DSW.
00:29:44,00:29:48,"I can't actually pronounce it, but James will be able to, because it's his second line."
00:29:48,00:29:49,Yeah.
00:29:49,00:29:50,I'm not interested.
00:29:50,00:29:51,It's Russian.
00:29:51,00:29:52,"Yeah, Russian does with that one."
00:29:52,00:29:53,Yeah.
00:29:53,00:29:54,You see.
00:29:54,00:29:55,That's a good bite.
00:29:55,00:29:56,DSW.
00:29:56,00:29:57,Good bite.
00:29:57,00:29:58,And then humor is H.I.
00:29:58,00:29:59,Humor intended.
00:29:59,00:30:00,H.E.
00:30:00,00:30:01,Is humor intended or laughter?
00:30:01,00:30:04,We should absolutely start using these after some of our jokes on the show.
00:30:04,00:30:07,I could just say H.I. after one of my puns.
00:30:07,00:30:10,Here's another thing I hadn't heard of.
00:30:10,00:30:11,Hog Morse.
00:30:11,00:30:12,Have you heard of Hog Morse?
00:30:12,00:30:13,"Hog Morse, yeah."
00:30:13,00:30:14,It's from...
00:30:14,00:30:15,Hog Morse.
00:30:15,00:30:16,Is it bad Morse?
00:30:16,00:30:17,Is it like Pigleton?
00:30:17,00:30:18,Yeah.
00:30:18,00:30:19,It's correct.
00:30:19,00:30:21,It's basically auto correct for when you're doing Morse.
00:30:21,00:30:25,It's the most commonly made mistakes when you're doing Morse code.
00:30:25,00:30:26,What does it mean?
00:30:26,00:30:28,Is it like letters which are similar or...?
00:30:28,00:30:29,Yeah.
00:30:29,00:30:33,"It's basically called after one example, home becoming hog."
00:30:33,00:30:37,"One example given in the literature is, please fill me in, becoming six NAS, FIMI, Q."
00:30:37,00:30:38,I see.
00:30:38,00:30:44,"So, ME is going to be dash dash dot or something, but then G is going to be dash dash dot"
00:30:44,00:30:45,without a space.
00:30:45,00:30:46,"Yes, yeah."
00:30:46,00:30:50,And I guess it is the risk of everything going really out of kilter if you mix up something
00:30:50,00:30:53,and then you get out of sync with the person receiving and they think your letters end
00:30:53,00:30:54,and start in different places.
00:30:54,00:30:55,Yeah.
00:30:55,00:30:56,And then he turns into Goldwoody Gook.
00:30:56,00:30:57,Yeah.
00:30:57,00:31:00,"So, this was... this whole fact is about a kind of secret message being set up basically"
00:31:00,00:31:01,in a sort of rude secret message.
00:31:01,00:31:02,Yes.
00:31:02,00:31:04,"So, I've found another example of this kind of thing."
00:31:04,00:31:06,Another thing from the second world war.
00:31:06,00:31:12,"So, Chinese engravers who are designing banknotes change the design of Chinese banknotes"
00:31:12,00:31:15,to score points off the Japanese who are occupying their country.
00:31:15,00:31:16,They.
00:31:16,00:31:17,Yeah.
00:31:17,00:31:22,"So, for example, the one you end up very, very common note, it has a picture of Confucius"
00:31:22,00:31:28,"on it and he's making a gesture of prayer almost, it looks quite Buddhist almost."
00:31:28,00:31:35,And some engravers changed some of the banknotes they made so that Confucius is doing the classic
00:31:35,00:31:36,sex mind.
00:31:36,00:31:40,"Well, you've used one thumb and finger, one hand and the finger on the other."
00:31:40,00:31:42,"And for people at home, Andy is doing said mind."
00:31:42,00:31:47,"A great radio, classic sex mind as he put it."
00:31:47,00:31:48,Yeah.
00:31:48,00:31:49,"So, they did that."
00:31:49,00:31:54,"Here's a thing about signalling out violent filthy language, an article from the Daily Mail"
00:31:54,00:32:00,"from a couple of years ago, mother Lauren Walker had enjoyed a day from hell at the hands"
00:32:00,00:32:01,of her son Max.
00:32:01,00:32:06,The two-year-old had smeared their dog in butter and put jam in the DVD player.
00:32:06,00:32:11,"Then he decided he didn't want the fish pie, she had spent two hours making."
00:32:11,00:32:16,"So she then spelt out the seawir, did his alphabets potato chips, did the pitch."
00:32:16,00:32:21,"I don't know how that becomes news, but it does take a lot."
00:32:21,00:32:24,It must be a photo on Instagram when you get picked up to something like that.
00:32:24,00:32:31,"I was reading, and President Andrew Jackson, he had a parrot that he taught to swear and"
00:32:31,00:32:35,apparently he attended his funeral and started swearing really loudly as funeral and had
00:32:35,00:32:36,to be taken out.
00:32:36,00:32:44,"Taking out my dirty, good service, bit harsh, but just open up the coffin and chuck it in with"
00:32:44,00:32:45,them.
00:32:45,00:32:52,There is an online service called eggplantmail.com where you can send a message to your loved
00:32:52,00:32:54,one.
00:32:54,00:33:02,"And the idea is that in emojis, an Obergine is a signal for something sexual and this company"
00:33:02,00:33:08,"will send a real life, Obergine, to your loved one, and they'll inscribe a message on it."
00:33:08,00:33:11,"And it's supposed to be a signal, it's like doing a real life emoji."
00:33:11,00:33:12,That's cool.
00:33:12,00:33:13,It's quite cool.
00:33:13,00:33:14,"It's quite good, isn't it?"
00:33:14,00:33:15,Yeah.
00:33:15,00:33:22,"They describe themselves as 100% phallic, 100% anonymous and 100% disturbing."
00:33:22,00:33:26,And 100% added maths.
00:33:26,00:33:34,"Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts, thank you so much for listening."
