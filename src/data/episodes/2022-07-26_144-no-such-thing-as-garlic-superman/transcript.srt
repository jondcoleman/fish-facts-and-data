00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,920
 to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,400
 My name is Dan Shriver and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Alex Bell and Andrew

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,640
 Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,440
 facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go.

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,240
 Starting with you, Andy Murray.

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:46,920
 My fact is that in 1851, all of the 436,800 sandwiches sold on the streets of London were

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,160
 ham.

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,120
 Just ham sandwiches.

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,800
 That's so obviously not true.

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,280
 Well, I think it is.

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,640
 Was it just ham or did they have ham and pickle or ham and mustard or?

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
 Add to mustard.

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
 Okay.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,160
 Had other sandwiches been invented at that point and they thought we don't actually like

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,160
 those will stick with ham.

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,440
 I think they have because I think they had cheese sandwiches because we've said before

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,120
 on this podcast these people called bread and meat or bread and cheese.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
 Yeah.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,480
 So I'll tell you basically ham sandwiching was a thing as in you didn't have a sandwich

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
 shop.

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,800
 You would be a sandwich seller and you have your own ham and you would boil it and then

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,920
 you would sell it from your car so it's quite hard to have a big range and we only know

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,880
 about this because there was a guy called Henry Mayhew who was a social investigator and

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,400
 he wrote this huge work called London Labor and the London Poor.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,960
 And he calculated that that number of sandwiches was sold and the only ones he came across

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,440
 were ham ones.

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,680
 So he's pretty amazing this guy.

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,680
 He is.

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,680
 I hadn't heard of him.

31
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,440
 He co-founded Punch which was the original British satirical magazine that ran for a

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
 God, hundreds of years.

33
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
 So might this have been satire?

34
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,440
 What are you talking about?

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
 No.

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,280
 And B Wilson, who's a food writer and her book is very good.

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,200
 She also has written an essay on the subject and she said that all the sandwiches were ham.

38
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,040
 If B Wilson says it then I do believe it.

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,680
 But even before the went and did punch he had the most ridiculous childhood.

40
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,960
 He ran away from home and he was 12 to join the East India company.

41
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
 Wow.

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,160
 And worked on their ships and then he came back and tried to law and then he went as journalists

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,160
 and but 12.

44
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,160
 He ran away and he was 12.

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,960
 But you know how people used to die younger?

46
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
 Is it like dog years?

47
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,440
 Well, actually like 18 back then.

48
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,120
 Well, I guess kind of but also it was he ran away because he didn't want to follow the same

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
 career as his father.

50
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
 It's a pretty early age.

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
 What did his father do?

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
 He was a sailor.

53
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
 Yeah.

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,640
 I think he was an accountant.

55
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,400
 Well, I can understand that.

56
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,040
 He was a very fertile accountant because Henry May, he was one of 17 children.

57
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
 Well, I see.

58
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
 17.

59
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
 Wow.

60
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,200
 He did report on his sandwich investigation that one seller told him that sometimes

61
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,760
 cab drivers would offer to fight them for a sandwich instead of paying for it.

62
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,600
 Doesn't really feel like it would be a good idea.

63
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,320
 Well, it doesn't work in print when I try it because as a sandwich seller, the best outcome

64
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,800
 is that you've won a fight and kept your sandwich, but you've had to fight someone not

65
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
 to lose a sandwich.

66
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
 Exactly.

67
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,360
 It feels like it would be better for you to do nothing at all than to get involved in

68
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
 this fight.

69
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
 Yeah.

70
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
 Yeah.

71
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,800
 This isn't the best hand-based story from 1851.

72
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
 It was a good deal, wasn't it?

73
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
 It was a very, very strong idea.

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
 Basically, when I was half in 1851, just give it a second.

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
 Yeah, sure.

76
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
 Great exhibition happened in London.

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
 And it was just ham sandwiches on the way.

78
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
 Yeah.

79
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,480
 Well, didn't they have tin food as one of the attractions?

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
 I guess ham may have been there.

81
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
 Ah.

82
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
 And also, Moby Dick was published.

83
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,600
 I've got to say the best Moby Dick fact ever, which we all know because it was found

84
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,120
 by one of our colleagues, Edward Kitchens, this last week, which is that he got a rejection

85
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,800
 letter from one publisher saying, "The whale is obviously a nice idea, but maybe you could

86
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,160
 replace it by something more popular.

87
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,600
 Maybe young voluptuous maiden."

88
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,840
 Why would you want to harpoon young voluptuous maiden?

89
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
 That's true.

90
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
 Like any sense?

91
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
 I would've been like, "Carry."

92
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
 It would've just been horror.

93
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,840
 Horror dolls.

94
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
 Hang on, hang on, Dan.

95
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,000
 You said you had a better ham anecdote from 1851.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Yeah.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Well, OK.

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Alex.

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Alex.

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Alex.

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Alex.

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 We all did it in our heads, James.

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 A podcast like that.

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Yeah.

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,360
 So, other news, Alex mentions the great exhibition, Moby Dick.

106
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,520
 Two other things that happened in 1851 is that the New York Times was founded and Reuters

107
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,280
 News was founded as well.

108
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,520
 So obviously, a lot more outlet to report ham-based stories were erupting that year.

109
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,240
 So, Christmas in 1851, have you heard about this in London?

110
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,800
 It was a sort of super great giveaway to all the poor of London to feed them on Christmas

111
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
 day.

112
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,040
 And it was over 22,000 people who were fed in one single place, and that place was called

113
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
 Ham Yard.

114
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,240
 And Ham Yard in London, they had benefactors from all the richest people in London who gave

115
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,400
 one guy called Mr. Richard Cooper, supplied 200 pounds of beef.

116
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,800
 And they did a massive Christmas meal for all the less privileged of London.

117
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,560
 So, over 22,000 people fed in one go by a very famous chef.

118
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,120
 He's often called the first celebrity chef, Alexis Sawyer.

119
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,400
 And it was his idea, and he put it together, and he fed all these people.

120
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
 Wow.

121
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
 Yeah.

122
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
 I've been to Ham Yard.

123
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
 It's all for Regent Street.

124
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
 Yes, it's all there, right?

125
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
 It's still there.

126
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
 Yeah.

127
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,960
 The best ham sandwich related story of the mid-19th century.

128
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,000
 Okay, that's cheating a bit.

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Well, it is.

130
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,640
 This comes from around 1840, so it's about 10 years before both of your ham-sandwich stories.

131
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,680
 Oh, and there's way better than if you've got predated.

132
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
 It's true.

133
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,800
 So, the town of Swindon was invented by a ham sandwich.

134
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
 What?

135
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,600
 It was founded by a ham sandwich, let's say.

136
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,320
 The story goes, I don't know if this is true, that Izanbar Kinden Brunel was on the railway,

137
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,920
 and he knew that they had to found a town somewhere on the railway because they needed to have

138
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,320
 a stop there.

139
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,040
 And he started eating his ham sandwich, and then he thought, "Well, as soon as I've had

140
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,880
 enough of this sandwich and I throw it out of the window, wherever it lands, that's

141
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,040
 where I'm going to start my new town."

142
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,480
 And it landed where currently Swindon is.

143
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
 Anyway.

144
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,840
 But I'm paying on.

145
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,720
 Because you'd have to stop the train immediately and go back and find the sandwich.

146
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,200
 That is true.

147
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
 Unless you remember.

148
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,720
 Oh, we were passing through Swindon when I threw my sandwich out of the window, and I threw

149
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,360
 my sandwich out right next to that sign that says, "Welcome to Swindon."

150
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
 The swindon was tiny.

151
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
 It was absolutely tiny before the railway arrived, and then it became huge.

152
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,160
 So there's another town that's sort of further south in what it's called, Mulbra.

153
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,560
 And it's absolutely tiny, but it could as easily have gone the other way.

154
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,840
 And if it isn't about King Dubin-Elford, you know, been a bit hungry, or had not a banana

155
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,200
 or breakfast, and he wanted a bit more of his sandwich.

156
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,080
 So ham sandwiches are still extremely popular.

157
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
 Oh, right.

158
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
 Yeah.

159
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,040
 The British Sandwich Association says that ham sandwiches is the most popular sandwich in

160
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
 the UK.

161
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
 Really?

162
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,480
 Do you think they'll look back in 100 years at 2016 and think it was a great age of ham

163
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
 sandwiches as well?

164
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,240
 I think finally, back to the great times of 1851.

165
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,960
 So this is an old survey.

166
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
 I can't imagine though.

167
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,280
 In 2001, I can't imagine, in 15 years, it's changed that much.

168
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,080
 But they said that the favourite filling wasn't ham though.

169
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,080
 It was cheese, but a ham sandwich on its own taught.

170
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,880
 But the favourite filling.

171
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
 Yeah.

172
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,600
 I always like my ham sandwiches without ham, but with cheese.

173
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
 Yeah.

174
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,200
 I think what they mean is what's your favourite filling?

175
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,800
 Well, if I'm having a sandwich, I love it if there's cheese in there.

176
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,200
 And they said, "Would you be happy with just a cheese sandwich?"

177
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
 No, no.

178
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
 I think I'll go for ham.

179
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
 I think that's how the conversation works.

180
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
 Wait.

181
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,640
 Is that because you have it outside the sandwich?

182
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,840
 No, you have it in the sandwich, but you might have it with ham, so you have a ham and cheese

183
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,840
 sandwich.

184
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,440
 So you're saying ham is not a filling because it's the base ingredient of the sandwich.

185
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
 No.

186
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
 If anything extra is a filling?

187
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
 No, no.

188
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
 There's two questions.

189
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
 What is this bread-added item in it?

190
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
 Yeah.

191
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
 And you could have at least one item in it.

192
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
 They've gone for ham sandwich.

193
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
 That works best as a sandwich.

194
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
 Yeah.

195
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,440
 What's your favourite filling to go in a sandwich?

196
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
 Oh, okay.

197
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,440
 Well, if I'm having a ham sandwich, rather than pickle, I'll have cheese.

198
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
 Cheese is the favourite added on.

199
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,560
 What's your favourite filling for two slices of bread is ham?

200
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
 Yeah.

201
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,640
 Of all the things that people have voted on in 2016, this makes me the most annoyed.

202
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,160
 Well, this is 2001, people say 2016 to shit you.

203
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,160
 Imagine you were presented with a lot of different sandwiches that had base meats in

204
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
 them.

205
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
 Right?

206
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,520
 Let's say, or no meat, or like a salad or whatever.

207
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
 Base meat.

208
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
 Like the alchemy of the sandwich.

209
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
 There's base 10.

210
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,760
 And then base meat to which is what our sandwiches are based on.

211
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,800
 Turned ham into cheese.

212
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,200
 Two thirds of ham and cheese pizzas tested by trading standards officers in Derbyshire

213
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,000
 failed to contain ham or cheese.

214
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 No.

215
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Yeah.

216
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 How many?

217
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Two thirds.

218
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Two thirds of the pizza.

219
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,200
 Oh, my God.

220
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,680
 What it was is when people thought it was ham, it was actually turkey ham, which is

221
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,800
 made of turkey not ham, and the cheese was often cheese substitutes.

222
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,640
 I'm not sure what cheese substitute is, but it doesn't sound great.

223
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,240
 Well, ham apparently.

224
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,400
 So Henry Mayhew did a load of, just to drag us back to Henry Mayhew for a bit.

225
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,560
 He did a load of calculations, basically.

226
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,680
 So he calculated how many sellers there were of each thing on the streets of London.

227
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,800
 So he calculated, for example, that there were 60 ham sandwich sellers in London, 200

228
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,880
 baked potatoes sellers, 300 people who sell pea, soup and hot eel, six people apparently

229
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,680
 specialised in plum puddings.

230
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
 Yeah.

231
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,520
 And he would work it out by estimating the number of miles of street in the city and then multiplying

232
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,760
 that by the number of traders he found per mile.

233
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
 Yeah.

234
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,280
 I think it sounds like the most fascinating book.

235
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,440
 I really want to read it.

236
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
 It's what's it called again?

237
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,040
 It's called London Leibat and the London poor.

238
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
 Yeah.

239
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,120
 And he basically documented 1851 in London, in down to every bit of clothing that people,

240
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,360
 it would be like us just going out on the street and just recording what's going on as a time

241
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
 capsule.

242
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
 And it's pretty amazing work.

243
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
 That'd be comprehensive.

244
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
 Really?

245
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
 Yeah.

246
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
 That's a big impact.

247
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,480
 He pissed off a lot of people with this book, particularly the street traders.

248
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,480
 And they actually set up a street trader's protection association against this kind of

249
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,240
 journalism, specifically because how they were presented in the book.

250
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,760
 They were presented like these sandwich sellers, they're like, well, actually we do have

251
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
 a bit more than ham.

252
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,600
 Yeah, exactly.

253
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
 Really?

254
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
 Yeah.

255
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
 Some of the sandwiches didn't even have ham in.

256
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
 Did they not?

257
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
 No.

258
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
 Just cheese.

259
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,680
 They had a bit of beef dripping and that was it, between two bits of bread.

260
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
 What is beef dripping?

261
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
 It's fat.

262
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
 Yeah.

263
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
 Sort of.

264
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
 It's a congeal fat.

265
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,960
 When you've caught beef, you get all the fat kind of drops down when you roast it.

266
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,240
 And then you can take that and you can kind of spread it on bread and it's what people

267
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
 used to eat.

268
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,520
 That sounds like cheese substitute.

269
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,240
 It does, but it doesn't taste anything like cheese, it tastes more like kind of fatty gravy.

270
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,280
 Oh, so delicious.

271
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,880
 Also, he collected a load of data with his brother Augustus Mayhew and yet 20 years after

272
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,440
 the book was published, Augustus Mayhew has had up in court on charges of attacking a

273
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,640
 female peddler or woman going on selling things.

274
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
 Really?

275
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,560
 And his defense in court was that people would knock on his door up to 38 times a day selling

276
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
 things.

277
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,960
 He just snapped and he said there were shouting things like crockery or fine young rabbits

278
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,680
 or roots all are blowing, all are growing.

279
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,320
 Fine young rabbits sounds like a great band doesn't he?

280
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
 Yeah.

281
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,280
 Did you know that there's a latitude around the earth that's sometimes referred to as the

282
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,480
 ham belt and it's 40 degrees latitude and it's not so much these days, but it used to

283
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,000
 be the climates at which all the best ham came from.

284
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,560
 So like Kentucky ham, Virginia ham, Italian, prosciutto ham, Spanish, Serrano ham, all

285
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,600
 of those places are along the same last student, it's because the climate is sort of ideal

286
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,300
 for ham curing and it's not so important nowadays because you know, you have climate control

287
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,300
 factors and whatnot.

288
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,300
 Yeah.

289
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,640
 And it was discovered by Alexander von Humbel.

290
00:11:53,640 --> 00:12:01,840
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Alex.

291
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,560
 My fact is that since 2003, the UK has eaten one and a half million pounds in cash.

292
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
 Okay.

293
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,320
 And when he said cash, are we talking 2P coins or notes, so this is the bank of England releases

294
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:22,400
 stats every year on the, yeah, the graph, Alex got a massive graph on his research notes.

295
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,200
 So for people at home, what happens is we kind of do some research and we print it out

296
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,120
 on a sheet of paper and we've got like little paragraphs that we might read out if something

297
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,640
 comes up, but Alex just has a massive graph.

298
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,600
 I'm concerned by the year to year trends and I'm going to explain.

299
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,200
 You can submit bank notes that are damaged in some way to the bank of England to get them

300
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
 replaced.

301
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
 Okay.

302
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
 And then they keep stats on them.

303
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
 So they release each year.

304
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:51,600
 How many bank notes have been torn apart or accidentally washed or contaminated or damaged

305
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
 by fire or flood?

306
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,400
 And the other category is chewed or eaten.

307
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
 Okay.

308
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,800
 So they've released how many, how many notes of each domination have been chewed or eaten

309
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,160
 and how much they're worth.

310
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,120
 And in total, since 2003, it's 1.5 million.

311
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
 Okay.

312
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,240
 So I reckon when you said that fact, people were thinking that humans were eating these notes,

313
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,760
 but I reckon it must be mostly like dogs and stuff.

314
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
 Maybe, yeah.

315
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
 It could be babies.

316
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
 It could be babies.

317
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
 Yeah.

318
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
 I mean, babies will put things in their mouths, wouldn't they?

319
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,240
 They will, but they don't have teeth.

320
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
 That's true.

321
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,040
 So they won't be chewing it and damaging it.

322
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,960
 I mean, some of them have teeth, don't they?

323
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,720
 Do you have to have teeth to chew?

324
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
 That's a good part of that.

325
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
 Can you chew with gums alone?

326
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,440
 You could suppose you could ruminate the note in your mouth so you could dissolve it.

327
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
 Yeah.

328
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,720
 I'd say a baby would be sucking rather than chewing.

329
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
 Yeah.

330
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
 Okay.

331
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,120
 Well, but you have to provide the remnants of the note to prove that you had it in the

332
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
 first place.

333
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,840
 In other words, you can just write it back and then say, "How do you, so what, you bring

334
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
 the dog?"

335
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,080
 So you bring the left of you to eat it.

336
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,040
 So there could be plenty of notes that have been completely eaten, I guess.

337
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
 It's very hard to say.

338
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,080
 My dog ate 2,000 quid in 50 pound notes.

339
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,160
 Unfortunately, he ate them so thoroughly, but if you could tell me, "No, but they do send

340
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
 this.

341
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
 I recommend it."

342
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,960
 It's called the mutilator's notes service and you post them in and you write a little

343
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
 explaining that.

344
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,960
 And if they think it's legit, then they'll post you some money.

345
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,280
 I could have used that.

346
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,840
 I once got given an envelope of some money and you've been paid it for asking those questions

347
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
 in the house.

348
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
 A comment.

349
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:25,840
 That's an excellent satire from the early 2000s, thank you.

350
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,040
 It's 19s actually, that's it.

351
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,800
 The rest of you can look that up at home and have a really entertaining, cash for questions.

352
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,240
 Anyway, sorry, go on, go on, done.

353
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,760
 So rather than opening the envelope the normal way, I opened it up at the top end of the,

354
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
 on the side.

355
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
 So I just ripped it open.

356
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
 The short edge of the envelope.

357
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
 Yes, exactly.

358
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,760
 So I ripped it open there and I, and then I got to the shop and it was closed and so I

359
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
 couldn't buy anything.

360
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,200
 And to my house came out in the morning to buy the milk that I was looking to buy, handed

361
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,800
 over from the envelope my £10 note and the guy said, I can't accept this.

362
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,560
 You're missing the last like eighth of the note.

363
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,680
 And what I had done, and there was about 60 quid in this envelope, I had ripped as well

364
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,280
 as the envelope, all that final eighth of all the notes.

365
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,240
 And they had scattered all on the street and had to go around the street collecting the

366
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
 rest of my notes.

367
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,240
 Yeah, I found them.

368
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
 They were all day afterwards.

369
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
 Yeah.

370
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
 Oh my god.

371
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
 Did you get the milk?

372
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
 Yeah.

373
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
 Right.

374
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,040
 I think that all of these banknotes were mostly eaten by dogs, not humans or babies, well, babies

375
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,520
 are humans, apart from baby dogs.

376
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,200
 So I think they're mostly eaten by dogs.

377
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,400
 In Montana, a few years ago, there was a new story about a dog called Sundance, who ate

378
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:43,560
 five $100 bills that were stashed in his owner's little cubby hole.

379
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,360
 But the five hundred dollar bills were together with a single one dollar bill, which it didn't

380
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
 eat.

381
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,400
 That's fantastic.

382
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
 Wow.

383
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
 This is interesting.

384
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,240
 Do you know where the first place to feature Queen Elizabeth on money was?

385
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
 Oh.

386
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
 So not Britain.

387
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
 It was not Britain.

388
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
 It was not Britain.

389
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
 Yeah.

390
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
 Was it somewhere in the Caribbean?

391
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
 No.

392
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,240
 Somewhere in Africa.

393
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
 No.

394
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
 Australia?

395
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
 No.

396
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
 Canada.

397
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
 Yes.

398
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,720
 I had her when she was a nine-year-old princess, so prior to being the Queen, and it was on

399
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
 their $20 notes.

400
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,680
 And so, obviously, she wasn't on any money here.

401
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
 She wasn't the Queen yet.

402
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,520
 But they wanted to give her some props over there.

403
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,160
 I'm not sure completely why, but they used her image.

404
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
 Yeah.

405
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,080
 Speaking of notes in Canada, a few years ago, there was a rumor that all Canadian banknotes

406
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:42,040
 smelled of maple syrup, and people were kind of pulling them out of their pockets and

407
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,040
 smelling them, and believed that they could smell maple syrup, and everyone on the internet

408
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,080
 was saying, "Yeah, my smell of maple syrup as well, but mine only smell of it when I take

409
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,320
 them out, my pocket, and they've warmed up, so there must be something in the note."

410
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,520
 And the pocket I keep on wearing maple syrup in, yeah.

411
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,480
 Well, I think that must have been it, or it was just like a weird hysteria, because the

412
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,800
 Bank of Canada said that actually there's nothing in there, and we've tested ours, and

413
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,120
 they don't smell a maple syrup.

414
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,880
 But they have got in trouble in the past as well, the Bank of Canada, because they did

415
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,800
 a new series of banknotes, and they put a maple leaf on, and it was pointed out that that

416
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,800
 maple leaf, that particular shape of maple leaf, is from a tree which does not grow in Canada.

417
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
 That's right.

418
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,200
 And they said, "No, weogen maple, raft, and the Canadian maple," and they said, "Actually,

419
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,520
 what we've done is we've blended together a load of maple leaves to avoid being regionally

420
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
 insensitive."

421
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:33,320
 Well, that's kind of like the Euro, though, because when they designed the Euro notes,

422
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,920
 they didn't want to favor any particular country-used culture, so they got someone to take

423
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,440
 a load of famous bridges from all the different countries that were taking the Euro, and sort

424
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,640
 of blend them into generic bridges that they got made up of.

425
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,640
 Yeah, so all the Euro money has fake bridges on it, so then when they found out it started

426
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,600
 building those bridges, it was an art installation rather than an actual bridge, but then he started

427
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,960
 building the fake bridges over rivers in Belgium or something.

428
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
 That's a great idea.

429
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
 Yeah.

430
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
 That's fantastic.

431
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,560
 For the odd, weird, reverse, forgery, but not money.

432
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
 Yeah.

433
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
 Oh, this is a cool thing about currency.

434
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:09,760
 So in, I think it was November or October, the Japanese financial services industry was

435
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,360
 considering regulating a new kind of currency, which was, and he guesses, "It's currency that

436
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
 James spends, and the rest of us don't."

437
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,840
 Oh, come on, money.

438
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
 It's Pokecoins.

439
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,880
 So as far as I understand, you use the currency to breed imaginary monsters on your phone.

440
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,640
 You use them to not buy monsters, but buy things that help you to find monsters.

441
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
 I see.

442
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,520
 Okay, so you can't even buy Pokemon with them.

443
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
 You can buy--

444
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
 No.

445
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
 Well, you've got to catch Pokemon.

446
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
 Yeah.

447
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
 So it's like you can buy a net with a Pokecoins.

448
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
 Kind of.

449
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
 You can buy a lure.

450
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,840
 That's spending real money on that.

451
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,720
 You can spend real money or you can find them in the game.

452
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
 Okay.

453
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
 So--

454
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,120
 But we all do it, like Temple Run, you know, when you spend money to buy more speedability and

455
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
 so on.

456
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
 We all do it, Andy.

457
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
 We all do it.

458
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
 Okay.

459
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,760
 The Japanese financial services authority is not considering regulating Temple Run coins,

460
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
 though.

461
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
 We are considering regulating--

462
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,080
 [LAUGHTER]

463
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,600
 And basically, if they did decide to regulate it, I don't think--

464
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,280
 I'm not sure if they'd come to a conclusion.

465
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,680
 Yeah, companies would have to declare all the unused currency that gamers have held.

466
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,600
 And they'd have to secure it with massive deposits of real money.

467
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
 Wow.

468
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
 It's really interesting.

469
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,200
 Speaking of digital money, there's a landfill in Wales, which has an enormous treasure trove.

470
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,720
 Like, I heard it buried treasure.

471
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,320
 And it's getting more and more valuable each year.

472
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,400
 So, in 2013, it was worth 4 million pounds.

473
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,480
 And it's because there's a hard drive, which a man called James Howell threw away in 2013.

474
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,800
 And he realized, after he thrown it away, that he had a digital wallet on it, which had

475
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,760
 $7,500 Bitcoin.

476
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,160
 And he got those in 2009, when they were worth nothing.

477
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,360
 But they now, worth 13, they're worth about 4 million pounds, and they're increasing a

478
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,360
 lot more since then.

479
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,360
 And so we don't know where it is in the--

480
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
 Somewhere out of it, yeah.

481
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,360
 Right.

482
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
 Yeah, so, yeah.

483
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,360
 Get big.

484
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
 Should we move on soon?

485
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
 Yeah.

486
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,720
 I have one thing that Motorola has invented an edible password.

487
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,760
 They call it an authentication vitamin.

488
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
 And it's a pill that you swallow.

489
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,160
 And if you have your phone, you're a wirelessly unlock it.

490
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
 Sorry.

491
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,680
 I'm a bit confused on how it works.

492
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
 So, you swallow a pill.

493
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,560
 You swallow a pill that has a tiny microchip in it, which broadcasts a little signal.

494
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,200
 And that's a signal that wirelessly unlock your devices if they're set up for it.

495
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,520
 So is it activated by the actors following it?

496
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
 No, no.

497
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
 You don't have to swallow it every time you don't have a phone.

498
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
 You put it in you.

499
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,880
 And then when you're around your phone, it's unlocked.

500
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
 But except for when you put it out.

501
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
 Yeah.

502
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
 So then you have to swallow another one.

503
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,760
 You have to have it in your pocket, because you could lose that, or someone else could...

504
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
 Take pocket you?

505
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
 Yeah.

506
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,640
 Whereas you can't have it stolen from you if you beat it.

507
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,560
 So, what you could do is you could put the little chip that's in a nice card, and you

508
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
 could eat that.

509
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,160
 And then every time you're walking towards the gates and the tube station, it'll be like

510
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,680
 you're on Star Wars or something.

511
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
 Yeah.

512
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:53,880
 And that is why, my Lord, I took a dump, or it was to bury it.

513
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
 Okay.

514
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,840
 It is time to move on to fact number three.

515
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,000
 And that is my fact.

516
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,960
 And my fact this week is that a day on the sun lasts both 25 and 38 Earth days.

517
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
 Okay.

518
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,240
 You have to explain, because it's always going to feel like daytime there, isn't it?

519
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
 Yeah.

520
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,240
 It's not really going to...

521
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,240
 Yeah.

522
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
 You're going to be confused.

523
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,600
 So, because it's a massive gas body, it spins at different speeds.

524
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,120
 So the middle of it, the equator, as it were, spins around 25 days.

525
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,440
 That makes one day's, but the poles go a lot slower.

526
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,840
 So it takes up to 38 days for them to turn around.

527
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,100
 So I should say that there are fluctuations in these numbers, obviously.

528
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,200
 So 24.7 is usually the number given for the quickest bit where the equator, where the middle

529
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,600
 of the sun is spinning around.

530
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,160
 38 is the top end bit.

531
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,680
 By asked Alex and I saw an astrophysicist the other night, Dr. Lucy Green.

532
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,640
 And she said that's absolutely true that they do have these different spins on them.

533
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
 Yeah.

534
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
 Really interesting.

535
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,680
 Actually, they also have differentials spin, because they're gas.

536
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
 Yeah.

537
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,560
 I found out this thing the other day, which I told the guys, but I haven't told you yet.

538
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,320
 So I'll ask you as a question.

539
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,360
 So let's assume that there are eight planets in the solar system.

540
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
 Yeah.

541
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,960
 How many planets in our solar system orbit the sun?

542
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,560
 Of those eight, all of them.

543
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,480
 Ah, technically, if you go into a super technical reasoning, we orbit the sun because

544
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,800
 at the center of the gravity that's pulling us, making us orbit the sun, is in the middle

545
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
 of the sun.

546
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,840
 Jupiter is so large, it's so big that it's pulled the center of gravity out to above the

547
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,160
 sun's surface.

548
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,640
 So technically, they are orbiting each other.

549
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
 That's really good.

550
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
 Yeah, it's quite cool.

551
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,400
 I had no idea Jupiter was that big.

552
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,920
 It also has a massively fast day, Jupiter.

553
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
 Does it?

554
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,160
 So yeah, it rotates every 10 hours.

555
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,680
 So daytime, nighttime, you just lost about five hours.

556
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
 Oh.

557
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
 She's really short.

558
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,400
 It's faster than any other planet.

559
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,560
 And if it was 80 times larger, which is not that much larger, it could have been a star,

560
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
 a star.

561
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
 Wow.

562
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
 Yeah.

563
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
 Well, we're done to us.

564
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,920
 Oh, I think we've been in big trouble.

565
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
 Yeah, issues, right?

566
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
 Probably.

567
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,840
 Hey, so I found this fact when I was reading a book called The Jupiter Effect, which is

568
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,160
 written by John Ribbon, who most people know is a massive popular science writer.

569
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,680
 He wrote in "Search a Shrodinger's Cat."

570
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,600
 And this book is the one book that he wants people to forget about.

571
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
 So I apologize.

572
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,960
 I'm glad because you've met John Ribbon, haven't you?

573
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
 I have.

574
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
 Yeah.

575
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
 He'll be delighted that you're bringing this up.

576
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
 Yeah.

577
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
 I'm really sorry, but it is out there.

578
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,720
 And it's a really well written book, except for one thing, which it has a conceit of it, which

579
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,880
 is that basically there was going to be a ginormous earthquake at the San Andreas fault on March

580
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,040
 the 10th of 1982, because they believe that all the planets were going to align, and it

581
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,040
 was just going to set off chaos on Earth, which never happened.

582
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,120
 It was a bestseller, though, but it didn't happen.

583
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,280
 And so he's kind of buried that book by writing about 200 more books to separate itself.

584
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,280
 I'm sure he writes tons of books.

585
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
 I think they're all brilliant.

586
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
 They're all brilliant.

587
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,520
 But yeah, do you think that's the reason he writes so many?

588
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,760
 I think just so it goes co-order down that bibliography list.

589
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
 Yeah.

590
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,560
 I'm just going back to the sun very quickly.

591
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
 Yes.

592
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,360
 What would happen if you replaced the sun with a black hole?

593
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,640
 So there'd be less light for starters.

594
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,320
 There'd be less energy coming from it.

595
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
 You would think?

596
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
 Yes.

597
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,280
 So it off-freeze to death.

598
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,560
 And we would get sucked into it, because that's...

599
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
 No.

600
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,560
 There we are.

601
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,560
 That's finally the thing.

602
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,560
 No, apparently.

603
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,920
 So the Oxford University Science Blog looks into this.

604
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,600
 And they found that apparently the planet's orbits would stay kind of much the same, because

605
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,920
 if it's the same mass as the sun, this black hole, then the gravitational field it produces

606
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,800
 is about the same as the sun.

607
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,160
 But it would be cold and dark.

608
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,120
 The sun is obviously emitting loads of heat, but Jupiter, it was all my Jupiter.

609
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,680
 Jupiter radiates so much heat, but it loses it faster than it gains energy from the sun,

610
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,280
 which means that it's shrinking about two centimeters a year.

611
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,280
 That is a year?

612
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
 Yeah.

613
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
 Two centimeters a year.

614
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
 I mean, it's massive.

615
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,280
 So that's relatively quite small amount.

616
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
 Yeah.

617
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:52,440
 Are there planets out there that we've seen exoplanet style that would be just enough atmosphere,

618
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,440
 tall enough that a six-foot person could stand in and sort of like run their life, but that's

619
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,440
 where the planet ends.

620
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,680
 Well, the only atmosphere.

621
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
 Yeah.

622
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:06,760
 So if you were to go to, I think it's Mars, they have a very, very, very weak atmosphere.

623
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,560
 And so it would kind of feel like winter at your head, but spring at your feet.

624
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
 Wow.

625
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,560
 Yeah.

626
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,320
 So you kind of, your head would be out of the atmosphere, kind of.

627
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,440
 So you have to, what do you have to, where do you spend Christmas?

628
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,920
 Do you have to go up a step ladder, basically, for Christmas, and then for the spring?

629
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,400
 So much just lie on the floor.

630
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,600
 Some are collection, just lie down.

631
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
 I have one more.

632
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,920
 Do you know what else is fueled by the sun?

633
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,040
 Superman, according to DC Comics.

634
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
 Really?

635
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,680
 No, this, because once he was bitten by Dracula and Dracula exploded.

636
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
 What?

637
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
 Science, guys.

638
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,920
 I've never caught up with a brand stoker novel.

639
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,440
 Wait, hang on, Dracula bites Superman, though, Superman explodes.

640
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,640
 No, Dracula explodes, because Dracula vampires don't like sunlight.

641
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,600
 How do we know Superman isn't made out of garlic?

642
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,320
 No, it's sweet.

643
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:04,920
 Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show.

644
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
 And that is James.

645
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:12,640
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1945, police in Halifax Nova Scotia initiated a campaign

646
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:19,760
 to stop people from beeping their carhons in Moscow to signal out vial and filthy language.

647
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,040
 And what were they saying in the Moscow?

648
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
 Do we know?

649
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
 This is the weird thing, right?

650
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,400
 So I saw this on a website called Boing Boing, which is one of my favourite places online.

651
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,160
 They have amazing facts and stuff like that on there.

652
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,760
 And it was a news cutting.

653
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,440
 And I'm pretty sure the news cutting is real, because I found it in other places.

654
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,640
 But that's the only thing on the whole of the internet that seems to give any idea that

655
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
 this actually happened.

656
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,280
 Now I see why you were throwing shade at my ham sandwich, in fact, you were drawn attention

657
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
 from your own.

658
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:55,480
 Yeah, fair enough, I don't know if it's true if anyone knows any more than do let us know.

659
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,440
 But I think it's a really, it's a nice idea if it's not true, right?

660
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
 Yeah.

661
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,520
 I think it's the most eloquent way to swear at someone through Moscow.

662
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
 It takes a long time.

663
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
 It takes a very long time.

664
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
 Oh, you're a dick.

665
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
 Kind of, yeah.

666
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
 Yeah.

667
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
 If you're in traffic though, you do have time.

668
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,520
 So you might as well send a message.

669
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
 That's true.

670
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
 Yeah.

671
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,520
 You're relying on the person who is a dick knowing Moscow.

672
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
 Yeah.

673
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
 Yeah.

674
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,720
 It's quite funny, because it does sound like you're actually just bleeping yourself as you're

675
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,240
 swearing at someone.

676
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,240
 So this is 1945.

677
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
 That's right.

678
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,720
 What kind of carhons were we at that point?

679
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,800
 What kind of cars were we at at that point?

680
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,160
 Well, we would have had cars that are not a million miles dissimilar to cars that we

681
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,280
 have now, their combustion engines.

682
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,040
 So maybe slightly bigger American cars, that kind of thing?

683
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
 Yeah.

684
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
 So the 50s is where I start.

685
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
 So the clock, what a car is.

686
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
 Okay.

687
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
 So imagine five years before that.

688
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
 Yeah, I got it there.

689
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:54,240
 But they've had horns, like a horn sound, since the very beginning of things with wheels

690
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
 on the road, haven't they?

691
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
 Yeah.

692
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
 So they predate cars.

693
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,600
 So they weren't they originally outside the cars, and people like walk alongside carriages

694
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,000
 with horns, or they'd walk alongside cars with horns.

695
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 What did you do?

696
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,800
 If you were just walking, you had a, you had a horse.

697
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,040
 Yes, I've heard, yeah, I've read this as well.

698
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,040
 Yeah.

699
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,200
 Pedestrians carried the first carhons to warn cars, and then eventually they said, why do

700
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,640
 we combine this with the car?

701
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,840
 I read that there was an early locomotive act, and the idea was that cars used to travel

702
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,080
 really slowly, and to warn people that cars were on the way.

703
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,160
 Someone would walk ahead of the car with a red flag.

704
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,160
 Okay.

705
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
 Was everything about this?

706
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
 Yeah, is it true?

707
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
 Is it true?

708
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
 Not really.

709
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
 Okay.

710
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,160
 It's true that the act existed.

711
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,160
 The act existed.

712
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
 Yep.

713
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:39,200
 And the red flag thing was used, and you would have to have three people operating a vehicle,

714
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,160
 one to steer it, one to stoke the boiler, and one to walk ahead who was called the stalker

715
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
 with the red flag.

716
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
 Yep.

717
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,480
 However, I think that when the act was introduced, cars were not a thing, because it was

718
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:57,400
 in about the 1870s, and by the time people started having personal cars, the red flag bit

719
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,560
 was not observed and have been repealed.

720
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
 Okay.

721
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
 From memory.

722
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
 Yeah.

723
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
 That's how it went.

724
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,560
 So, yeah.

725
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:10,160
 I was looking online about sometimes in Moore's code, you know, how on text messages, you

726
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,800
 know, lol for a laugh out loud.

727
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,560
 There's a long list of how they do abbreviations for longer sentences.

728
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,440
 So one of my favorite ones, and this is goodbye, so I want to see who gets this.

729
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,440
 If you were doing a shortened Moore's code of goodbye, it's DSW.

730
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
 Why would it be DSW?

731
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
 Don't?

732
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
 Darling?

733
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
 What?

734
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
 No, DSW.

735
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
 Oh, you were doing DSW.

736
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
 You were doing that for three words?

737
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
 No, it doesn't actually.

738
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
 Oh.

739
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
 Then I'm not going to know it.

740
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
 DSW.

741
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,440
 I would have thought I would have gone for CU, because that would be shorter.

742
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
 Yes, it would have been.

743
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
 Yeah.

744
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
 So what's DSW?

745
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
 DSW.

746
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,440
 I can't actually pronounce it, but James will be able to, because it's his second line.

747
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
 Yeah.

748
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,440
 I'm not interested.

749
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,440
 It's Russian.

750
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,440
 Yeah, Russian does with that one.

751
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
 Yeah.

752
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,440
 You see.

753
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
 That's a good bite.

754
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
 DSW.

755
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
 Good bite.

756
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
 And then humor is H.I.

757
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440
 Humor intended.

758
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
 H.E.

759
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
 Is humor intended or laughter?

760
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,440
 We should absolutely start using these after some of our jokes on the show.

761
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,440
 I could just say H.I. after one of my puns.

762
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,440
 Here's another thing I hadn't heard of.

763
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
 Hog Morse.

764
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,440
 Have you heard of Hog Morse?

765
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
 Hog Morse, yeah.

766
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,920
 It's from...

767
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
 Hog Morse.

768
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
 Is it bad Morse?

769
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
 Is it like Pigleton?

770
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
 Yeah.

771
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
 It's correct.

772
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,920
 It's basically auto correct for when you're doing Morse.

773
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,920
 It's the most commonly made mistakes when you're doing Morse code.

774
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
 What does it mean?

775
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
 Is it like letters which are similar or...?

776
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
 Yeah.

777
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,440
 It's basically called after one example, home becoming hog.

778
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,920
 One example given in the literature is, please fill me in, becoming six NAS, FIMI, Q.

779
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
 I see.

780
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:44,920
 So, ME is going to be dash dash dot or something, but then G is going to be dash dash dot

781
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
 without a space.

782
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
 Yes, yeah.

783
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,560
 And I guess it is the risk of everything going really out of kilter if you mix up something

784
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,440
 and then you get out of sync with the person receiving and they think your letters end

785
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,440
 and start in different places.

786
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
 Yeah.

787
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
 And then he turns into Goldwoody Gook.

788
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
 Yeah.

789
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,440
 So, this was... this whole fact is about a kind of secret message being set up basically

790
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,680
 in a sort of rude secret message.

791
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
 Yes.

792
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,920
 So, I've found another example of this kind of thing.

793
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,560
 Another thing from the second world war.

794
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:12,120
 So, Chinese engravers who are designing banknotes change the design of Chinese banknotes

795
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,360
 to score points off the Japanese who are occupying their country.

796
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,360
 They.

797
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
 Yeah.

798
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,120
 So, for example, the one you end up very, very common note, it has a picture of Confucius

799
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:28,520
 on it and he's making a gesture of prayer almost, it looks quite Buddhist almost.

800
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:35,000
 And some engravers changed some of the banknotes they made so that Confucius is doing the classic

801
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 sex mind.

802
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,240
 Well, you've used one thumb and finger, one hand and the finger on the other.

803
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,920
 And for people at home, Andy is doing said mind.

804
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,160
 A great radio, classic sex mind as he put it.

805
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
 Yeah.

806
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160
 So, they did that.

807
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:54,720
 Here's a thing about signalling out violent filthy language, an article from the Daily Mail

808
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,040
 from a couple of years ago, mother Lauren Walker had enjoyed a day from hell at the hands

809
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,760
 of her son Max.

810
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,960
 The two-year-old had smeared their dog in butter and put jam in the DVD player.

811
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,600
 Then he decided he didn't want the fish pie, she had spent two hours making.

812
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,640
 So she then spelt out the seawir, did his alphabets potato chips, did the pitch.

813
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,640
 I don't know how that becomes news, but it does take a lot.

814
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,880
 It must be a photo on Instagram when you get picked up to something like that.

815
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:31,640
 I was reading, and President Andrew Jackson, he had a parrot that he taught to swear and

816
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,400
 apparently he attended his funeral and started swearing really loudly as funeral and had

817
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
 to be taken out.

818
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:44,440
 Taking out my dirty, good service, bit harsh, but just open up the coffin and chuck it in with

819
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,440
 them.

820
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,800
 There is an online service called eggplantmail.com where you can send a message to your loved

821
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,120
 one.

822
00:32:54,120 --> 00:33:02,960
 And the idea is that in emojis, an Obergine is a signal for something sexual and this company

823
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,760
 will send a real life, Obergine, to your loved one, and they'll inscribe a message on it.

824
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,320
 And it's supposed to be a signal, it's like doing a real life emoji.

825
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,320
 That's cool.

826
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,320
 It's quite cool.

827
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,320
 It's quite good, isn't it?

828
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
 Yeah.

829
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:22,720
 They describe themselves as 100% phallic, 100% anonymous and 100% disturbing.

830
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,000
 And 100% added maths.

831
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,760
 Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts, thank you so much for listening.

 look at the week.

839
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,280
 At which week?

840
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
 All the previous weeks.

841
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
 All the old weeks.

842
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,760
 If you were really thinking to yourself, I'd love to know what happened in November and

843
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,080
 late October of this year, head to know such thing as the news.com.

844
