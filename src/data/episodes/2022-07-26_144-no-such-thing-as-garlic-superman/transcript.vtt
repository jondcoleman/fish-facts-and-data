00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.920
 to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.400
 My name is Dan Shriver and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Alex Bell and Andrew

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.640
 Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.440
 facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.240
 Starting with you, Andy Murray.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:46.920
 My fact is that in 1851, all of the 436,800 sandwiches sold on the streets of London were

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.160
 ham.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.120
 Just ham sandwiches.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.800
 That's so obviously not true.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.280
 Well, I think it is.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.640
 Was it just ham or did they have ham and pickle or ham and mustard or?

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 Add to mustard.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.640
 Okay.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.160
 Had other sandwiches been invented at that point and they thought we don't actually like

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.160
 those will stick with ham.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.440
 I think they have because I think they had cheese sandwiches because we've said before

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.120
 on this podcast these people called bread and meat or bread and cheese.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.120
 Yeah.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.480
 So I'll tell you basically ham sandwiching was a thing as in you didn't have a sandwich

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.480
 shop.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.800
 You would be a sandwich seller and you have your own ham and you would boil it and then

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.920
 you would sell it from your car so it's quite hard to have a big range and we only know

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.880
 about this because there was a guy called Henry Mayhew who was a social investigator and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.400
 he wrote this huge work called London Labor and the London Poor.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.960
 And he calculated that that number of sandwiches was sold and the only ones he came across

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.440
 were ham ones.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.680
 So he's pretty amazing this guy.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.680
 He is.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.680
 I hadn't heard of him.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.440
 He co-founded Punch which was the original British satirical magazine that ran for a

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.440
 God, hundreds of years.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.440
 So might this have been satire?

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.440
 What are you talking about?

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.440
 No.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.280
 And B Wilson, who's a food writer and her book is very good.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.200
 She also has written an essay on the subject and she said that all the sandwiches were ham.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.040
 If B Wilson says it then I do believe it.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.680
 But even before the went and did punch he had the most ridiculous childhood.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.960
 He ran away from home and he was 12 to join the East India company.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.960
 Wow.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.160
 And worked on their ships and then he came back and tried to law and then he went as journalists

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.160
 and but 12.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.160
 He ran away and he was 12.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.960
 But you know how people used to die younger?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.960
 Is it like dog years?

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.440
 Well, actually like 18 back then.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.120
 Well, I guess kind of but also it was he ran away because he didn't want to follow the same

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.120
 career as his father.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.120
 It's a pretty early age.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.120
 What did his father do?

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.120
 He was a sailor.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.120
 Yeah.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.640
 I think he was an accountant.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.400
 Well, I can understand that.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.040
 He was a very fertile accountant because Henry May, he was one of 17 children.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.040
 Well, I see.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040
 17.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.040
 Wow.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.200
 He did report on his sandwich investigation that one seller told him that sometimes

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.760
 cab drivers would offer to fight them for a sandwich instead of paying for it.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.600
 Doesn't really feel like it would be a good idea.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.320
 Well, it doesn't work in print when I try it because as a sandwich seller, the best outcome

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.800
 is that you've won a fight and kept your sandwich, but you've had to fight someone not

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800
 to lose a sandwich.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800
 Exactly.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.360
 It feels like it would be better for you to do nothing at all than to get involved in

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.360
 this fight.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360
 Yeah.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.360
 Yeah.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.800
 This isn't the best hand-based story from 1851.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.800
 It was a good deal, wasn't it?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 It was a very, very strong idea.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.800
 Basically, when I was half in 1851, just give it a second.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.800
 Yeah, sure.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.800
 Great exhibition happened in London.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800
 And it was just ham sandwiches on the way.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800
 Yeah.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.480
 Well, didn't they have tin food as one of the attractions?

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.480
 I guess ham may have been there.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.480
 Ah.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.480
 And also, Moby Dick was published.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.600
 I've got to say the best Moby Dick fact ever, which we all know because it was found

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.120
 by one of our colleagues, Edward Kitchens, this last week, which is that he got a rejection

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.800
 letter from one publisher saying, "The whale is obviously a nice idea, but maybe you could

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.160
 replace it by something more popular.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.600
 Maybe young voluptuous maiden."

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.840
 Why would you want to harpoon young voluptuous maiden?

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.840
 That's true.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840
 Like any sense?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840
 I would've been like, "Carry."

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.840
 It would've just been horror.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840
 Horror dolls.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.840
 Hang on, hang on, Dan.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.000
 You said you had a better ham anecdote from 1851.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Yeah.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Well, OK.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 Alex.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Alex.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Alex.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Alex.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 We all did it in our heads, James.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 A podcast like that.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Yeah.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.360
 So, other news, Alex mentions the great exhibition, Moby Dick.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.520
 Two other things that happened in 1851 is that the New York Times was founded and Reuters

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.280
 News was founded as well.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.520
 So obviously, a lot more outlet to report ham-based stories were erupting that year.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.240
 So, Christmas in 1851, have you heard about this in London?

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.800
 It was a sort of super great giveaway to all the poor of London to feed them on Christmas

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.800
 day.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.040
 And it was over 22,000 people who were fed in one single place, and that place was called

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.040
 Ham Yard.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.240
 And Ham Yard in London, they had benefactors from all the richest people in London who gave

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.400
 one guy called Mr. Richard Cooper, supplied 200 pounds of beef.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.800
 And they did a massive Christmas meal for all the less privileged of London.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.560
 So, over 22,000 people fed in one go by a very famous chef.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.120
 He's often called the first celebrity chef, Alexis Sawyer.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.400
 And it was his idea, and he put it together, and he fed all these people.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.400
 Wow.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 Yeah.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.400
 I've been to Ham Yard.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400
 It's all for Regent Street.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400
 Yes, it's all there, right?

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.400
 It's still there.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.400
 Yeah.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.960
 The best ham sandwich related story of the mid-19th century.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.000
 Okay, that's cheating a bit.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Well, it is.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.640
 This comes from around 1840, so it's about 10 years before both of your ham-sandwich stories.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.680
 Oh, and there's way better than if you've got predated.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680
 It's true.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.800
 So, the town of Swindon was invented by a ham sandwich.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.800
 What?

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.600
 It was founded by a ham sandwich, let's say.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.320
 The story goes, I don't know if this is true, that Izanbar Kinden Brunel was on the railway,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.920
 and he knew that they had to found a town somewhere on the railway because they needed to have

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.320
 a stop there.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.040
 And he started eating his ham sandwich, and then he thought, "Well, as soon as I've had

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.880
 enough of this sandwich and I throw it out of the window, wherever it lands, that's

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.040
 where I'm going to start my new town."

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.480
 And it landed where currently Swindon is.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.480
 Anyway.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.840
 But I'm paying on.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.720
 Because you'd have to stop the train immediately and go back and find the sandwich.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.200
 That is true.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.200
 Unless you remember.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.720
 Oh, we were passing through Swindon when I threw my sandwich out of the window, and I threw

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.360
 my sandwich out right next to that sign that says, "Welcome to Swindon."

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.360
 The swindon was tiny.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.000
 It was absolutely tiny before the railway arrived, and then it became huge.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.160
 So there's another town that's sort of further south in what it's called, Mulbra.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.560
 And it's absolutely tiny, but it could as easily have gone the other way.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.840
 And if it isn't about King Dubin-Elford, you know, been a bit hungry, or had not a banana

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.200
 or breakfast, and he wanted a bit more of his sandwich.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.080
 So ham sandwiches are still extremely popular.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.080
 Oh, right.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.080
 Yeah.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.040
 The British Sandwich Association says that ham sandwiches is the most popular sandwich in

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.040
 the UK.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040
 Really?

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.480
 Do you think they'll look back in 100 years at 2016 and think it was a great age of ham

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.480
 sandwiches as well?

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.240
 I think finally, back to the great times of 1851.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.960
 So this is an old survey.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.960
 I can't imagine though.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.280
 In 2001, I can't imagine, in 15 years, it's changed that much.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.080
 But they said that the favourite filling wasn't ham though.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.080
 It was cheese, but a ham sandwich on its own taught.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.880
 But the favourite filling.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.880
 Yeah.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.600
 I always like my ham sandwiches without ham, but with cheese.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.600
 Yeah.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.200
 I think what they mean is what's your favourite filling?

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.800
 Well, if I'm having a sandwich, I love it if there's cheese in there.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.200
 And they said, "Would you be happy with just a cheese sandwich?"

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.200
 No, no.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.200
 I think I'll go for ham.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.200
 I think that's how the conversation works.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.200
 Wait.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.640
 Is that because you have it outside the sandwich?

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.840
 No, you have it in the sandwich, but you might have it with ham, so you have a ham and cheese

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.840
 sandwich.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.440
 So you're saying ham is not a filling because it's the base ingredient of the sandwich.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.440
 No.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.440
 If anything extra is a filling?

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.440
 No, no.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.440
 There's two questions.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.440
 What is this bread-added item in it?

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.440
 Yeah.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.440
 And you could have at least one item in it.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.440
 They've gone for ham sandwich.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.440
 That works best as a sandwich.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.440
 Yeah.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.440
 What's your favourite filling to go in a sandwich?

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.440
 Oh, okay.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.440
 Well, if I'm having a ham sandwich, rather than pickle, I'll have cheese.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.440
 Cheese is the favourite added on.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.560
 What's your favourite filling for two slices of bread is ham?

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.560
 Yeah.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.640
 Of all the things that people have voted on in 2016, this makes me the most annoyed.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.160
 Well, this is 2001, people say 2016 to shit you.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.160
 Imagine you were presented with a lot of different sandwiches that had base meats in

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.160
 them.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.160
 Right?

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.520
 Let's say, or no meat, or like a salad or whatever.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.520
 Base meat.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.520
 Like the alchemy of the sandwich.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.520
 There's base 10.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.760
 And then base meat to which is what our sandwiches are based on.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.800
 Turned ham into cheese.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.200
 Two thirds of ham and cheese pizzas tested by trading standards officers in Derbyshire

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.000
 failed to contain ham or cheese.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 No.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Yeah.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 How many?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Two thirds.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Two thirds of the pizza.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.200
 Oh, my God.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.680
 What it was is when people thought it was ham, it was actually turkey ham, which is

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.800
 made of turkey not ham, and the cheese was often cheese substitutes.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.640
 I'm not sure what cheese substitute is, but it doesn't sound great.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.240
 Well, ham apparently.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:09.400
 So Henry Mayhew did a load of, just to drag us back to Henry Mayhew for a bit.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.560
 He did a load of calculations, basically.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.680
 So he calculated how many sellers there were of each thing on the streets of London.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.800
 So he calculated, for example, that there were 60 ham sandwich sellers in London, 200

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.880
 baked potatoes sellers, 300 people who sell pea, soup and hot eel, six people apparently

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.680
 specialised in plum puddings.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.680
 Yeah.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.520
 And he would work it out by estimating the number of miles of street in the city and then multiplying

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.760
 that by the number of traders he found per mile.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.760
 Yeah.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.280
 I think it sounds like the most fascinating book.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.440
 I really want to read it.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.440
 It's what's it called again?

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.040
 It's called London Leibat and the London poor.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.040
 Yeah.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.120
 And he basically documented 1851 in London, in down to every bit of clothing that people,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.360
 it would be like us just going out on the street and just recording what's going on as a time

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.360
 capsule.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.360
 And it's pretty amazing work.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.360
 That'd be comprehensive.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.360
 Really?

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.360
 Yeah.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.360
 That's a big impact.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.480
 He pissed off a lot of people with this book, particularly the street traders.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:06.480
 And they actually set up a street trader's protection association against this kind of

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.240
 journalism, specifically because how they were presented in the book.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.760
 They were presented like these sandwich sellers, they're like, well, actually we do have

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.760
 a bit more than ham.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.600
 Really?

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.600
 Yeah.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.600
 Some of the sandwiches didn't even have ham in.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.600
 Did they not?

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.600
 No.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.600
 Just cheese.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.680
 They had a bit of beef dripping and that was it, between two bits of bread.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.680
 What is beef dripping?

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.680
 It's fat.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.680
 Yeah.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.680
 Sort of.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.680
 It's a congeal fat.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.960
 When you've caught beef, you get all the fat kind of drops down when you roast it.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.240
 And then you can take that and you can kind of spread it on bread and it's what people

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.240
 used to eat.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.520
 That sounds like cheese substitute.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.240
 It does, but it doesn't taste anything like cheese, it tastes more like kind of fatty gravy.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.280
 Oh, so delicious.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.880
 Also, he collected a load of data with his brother Augustus Mayhew and yet 20 years after

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.440
 the book was published, Augustus Mayhew has had up in court on charges of attacking a

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.640
 female peddler or woman going on selling things.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.640
 Really?

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.560
 And his defense in court was that people would knock on his door up to 38 times a day selling

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.560
 things.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:14.960
 He just snapped and he said there were shouting things like crockery or fine young rabbits

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.680
 or roots all are blowing, all are growing.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.320
 Fine young rabbits sounds like a great band doesn't he?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.320
 Yeah.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:27.280
 Did you know that there's a latitude around the earth that's sometimes referred to as the

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.480
 ham belt and it's 40 degrees latitude and it's not so much these days, but it used to

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.000
 be the climates at which all the best ham came from.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.560
 So like Kentucky ham, Virginia ham, Italian, prosciutto ham, Spanish, Serrano ham, all

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.600
 of those places are along the same last student, it's because the climate is sort of ideal

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.300
 for ham curing and it's not so important nowadays because you know, you have climate control

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.300
 factors and whatnot.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.300
 Yeah.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:53.640
 And it was discovered by Alexander von Humbel.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:12:01.840
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Alex.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:07.560
 My fact is that since 2003, the UK has eaten one and a half million pounds in cash.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560
 Okay.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:15.320
 And when he said cash, are we talking 2P coins or notes, so this is the bank of England releases

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:22.400
 stats every year on the, yeah, the graph, Alex got a massive graph on his research notes.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.200
 So for people at home, what happens is we kind of do some research and we print it out

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.120
 on a sheet of paper and we've got like little paragraphs that we might read out if something

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.640
 comes up, but Alex just has a massive graph.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.600
 I'm concerned by the year to year trends and I'm going to explain.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.200
 You can submit bank notes that are damaged in some way to the bank of England to get them

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.200
 replaced.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.200
 Okay.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.200
 And then they keep stats on them.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.200
 So they release each year.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:51.600
 How many bank notes have been torn apart or accidentally washed or contaminated or damaged

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.600
 by fire or flood?

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.400
 And the other category is chewed or eaten.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.400
 Okay.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.800
 So they've released how many, how many notes of each domination have been chewed or eaten

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.160
 and how much they're worth.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.120
 And in total, since 2003, it's 1.5 million.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.120
 Okay.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.240
 So I reckon when you said that fact, people were thinking that humans were eating these notes,

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.760
 but I reckon it must be mostly like dogs and stuff.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.760
 Maybe, yeah.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.760
 It could be babies.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.760
 It could be babies.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.760
 Yeah.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.760
 I mean, babies will put things in their mouths, wouldn't they?

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.240
 They will, but they don't have teeth.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.240
 That's true.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.040
 So they won't be chewing it and damaging it.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.960
 I mean, some of them have teeth, don't they?

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.720
 Do you have to have teeth to chew?

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.720
 That's a good part of that.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.560
 Can you chew with gums alone?

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.440
 You could suppose you could ruminate the note in your mouth so you could dissolve it.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.440
 Yeah.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.720
 I'd say a baby would be sucking rather than chewing.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.720
 Yeah.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.720
 Okay.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.120
 Well, but you have to provide the remnants of the note to prove that you had it in the

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.120
 first place.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.840
 In other words, you can just write it back and then say, "How do you, so what, you bring

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840
 the dog?"

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.080
 So you bring the left of you to eat it.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.040
 So there could be plenty of notes that have been completely eaten, I guess.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.040
 It's very hard to say.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.080
 My dog ate 2,000 quid in 50 pound notes.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.160
 Unfortunately, he ate them so thoroughly, but if you could tell me, "No, but they do send

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.160
 this.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.160
 I recommend it."

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.960
 It's called the mutilator's notes service and you post them in and you write a little

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.960
 explaining that.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.960
 And if they think it's legit, then they'll post you some money.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.280
 I could have used that.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.840
 I once got given an envelope of some money and you've been paid it for asking those questions

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.840
 in the house.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.840
 A comment.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:25.840
 That's an excellent satire from the early 2000s, thank you.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.040
 It's 19s actually, that's it.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.800
 The rest of you can look that up at home and have a really entertaining, cash for questions.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.240
 Anyway, sorry, go on, go on, done.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.760
 So rather than opening the envelope the normal way, I opened it up at the top end of the,

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.760
 on the side.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.760
 So I just ripped it open.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.760
 The short edge of the envelope.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.760
 Yes, exactly.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.760
 So I ripped it open there and I, and then I got to the shop and it was closed and so I

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.760
 couldn't buy anything.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.200
 And to my house came out in the morning to buy the milk that I was looking to buy, handed

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.800
 over from the envelope my £10 note and the guy said, I can't accept this.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.560
 You're missing the last like eighth of the note.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.680
 And what I had done, and there was about 60 quid in this envelope, I had ripped as well

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.280
 as the envelope, all that final eighth of all the notes.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.240
 And they had scattered all on the street and had to go around the street collecting the

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.240
 rest of my notes.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.240
 Yeah, I found them.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.240
 They were all day afterwards.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.240
 Yeah.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.240
 Oh my god.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.240
 Did you get the milk?

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.240
 Yeah.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.240
 Right.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:25.040
 I think that all of these banknotes were mostly eaten by dogs, not humans or babies, well, babies

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.520
 are humans, apart from baby dogs.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.200
 So I think they're mostly eaten by dogs.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.400
 In Montana, a few years ago, there was a new story about a dog called Sundance, who ate

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:43.560
 five $100 bills that were stashed in his owner's little cubby hole.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.360
 But the five hundred dollar bills were together with a single one dollar bill, which it didn't

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.360
 eat.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.400
 That's fantastic.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400
 Wow.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.400
 This is interesting.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.240
 Do you know where the first place to feature Queen Elizabeth on money was?

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.240
 Oh.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.240
 So not Britain.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.240
 It was not Britain.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.240
 It was not Britain.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.240
 Yeah.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.240
 Was it somewhere in the Caribbean?

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.240
 No.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.240
 Somewhere in Africa.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.240
 No.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.240
 Australia?

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.240
 No.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.240
 Canada.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.240
 Yes.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:19.720
 I had her when she was a nine-year-old princess, so prior to being the Queen, and it was on

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.720
 their $20 notes.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.680
 And so, obviously, she wasn't on any money here.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.680
 She wasn't the Queen yet.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.520
 But they wanted to give her some props over there.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.160
 I'm not sure completely why, but they used her image.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.160
 Yeah.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.080
 Speaking of notes in Canada, a few years ago, there was a rumor that all Canadian banknotes

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:42.040
 smelled of maple syrup, and people were kind of pulling them out of their pockets and

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.040
 smelling them, and believed that they could smell maple syrup, and everyone on the internet

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.080
 was saying, "Yeah, my smell of maple syrup as well, but mine only smell of it when I take

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.320
 them out, my pocket, and they've warmed up, so there must be something in the note."

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.520
 And the pocket I keep on wearing maple syrup in, yeah.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.480
 Well, I think that must have been it, or it was just like a weird hysteria, because the

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.800
 Bank of Canada said that actually there's nothing in there, and we've tested ours, and

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.120
 they don't smell a maple syrup.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.880
 But they have got in trouble in the past as well, the Bank of Canada, because they did

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.800
 a new series of banknotes, and they put a maple leaf on, and it was pointed out that that

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.800
 maple leaf, that particular shape of maple leaf, is from a tree which does not grow in Canada.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.800
 That's right.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.200
 And they said, "No, weogen maple, raft, and the Canadian maple," and they said, "Actually,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.520
 what we've done is we've blended together a load of maple leaves to avoid being regionally

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.520
 insensitive."

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:33.320
 Well, that's kind of like the Euro, though, because when they designed the Euro notes,

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.920
 they didn't want to favor any particular country-used culture, so they got someone to take

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.440
 a load of famous bridges from all the different countries that were taking the Euro, and sort

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.640
 of blend them into generic bridges that they got made up of.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:48.640
 Yeah, so all the Euro money has fake bridges on it, so then when they found out it started

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.600
 building those bridges, it was an art installation rather than an actual bridge, but then he started

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.960
 building the fake bridges over rivers in Belgium or something.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.960
 That's a great idea.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.960
 Yeah.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.960
 That's fantastic.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.560
 For the odd, weird, reverse, forgery, but not money.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.560
 Yeah.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.560
 Oh, this is a cool thing about currency.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:09.760
 So in, I think it was November or October, the Japanese financial services industry was

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:16.360
 considering regulating a new kind of currency, which was, and he guesses, "It's currency that

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.360
 James spends, and the rest of us don't."

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.840
 Oh, come on, money.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.840
 It's Pokecoins.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.880
 So as far as I understand, you use the currency to breed imaginary monsters on your phone.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.640
 You use them to not buy monsters, but buy things that help you to find monsters.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.640
 I see.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.520
 Okay, so you can't even buy Pokemon with them.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.520
 You can buy--

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.520
 No.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.520
 Well, you've got to catch Pokemon.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.520
 Yeah.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.520
 So it's like you can buy a net with a Pokecoins.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.520
 Kind of.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.520
 You can buy a lure.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.840
 That's spending real money on that.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.720
 You can spend real money or you can find them in the game.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.720
 Okay.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.720
 So--

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.120
 But we all do it, like Temple Run, you know, when you spend money to buy more speedability and

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.120
 so on.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.120
 We all do it, Andy.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.120
 We all do it.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.120
 Okay.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.760
 The Japanese financial services authority is not considering regulating Temple Run coins,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.760
 though.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.760
 We are considering regulating--

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.600
 And basically, if they did decide to regulate it, I don't think--

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.280
 I'm not sure if they'd come to a conclusion.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.680
 Yeah, companies would have to declare all the unused currency that gamers have held.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.600
 And they'd have to secure it with massive deposits of real money.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.600
 Wow.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.600
 It's really interesting.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:22.200
 Speaking of digital money, there's a landfill in Wales, which has an enormous treasure trove.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.720
 Like, I heard it buried treasure.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.320
 And it's getting more and more valuable each year.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.400
 So, in 2013, it was worth 4 million pounds.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:33.480
 And it's because there's a hard drive, which a man called James Howell threw away in 2013.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.800
 And he realized, after he thrown it away, that he had a digital wallet on it, which had

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.760
 $7,500 Bitcoin.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.160
 And he got those in 2009, when they were worth nothing.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.360
 But they now, worth 13, they're worth about 4 million pounds, and they're increasing a

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.360
 lot more since then.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.360
 And so we don't know where it is in the--

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.360
 Somewhere out of it, yeah.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.360
 Right.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.360
 Yeah, so, yeah.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.360
 Get big.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.360
 Should we move on soon?

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.360
 Yeah.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.720
 I have one thing that Motorola has invented an edible password.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.760
 They call it an authentication vitamin.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.760
 And it's a pill that you swallow.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.160
 And if you have your phone, you're a wirelessly unlock it.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.160
 Sorry.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.680
 I'm a bit confused on how it works.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.680
 So, you swallow a pill.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.560
 You swallow a pill that has a tiny microchip in it, which broadcasts a little signal.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.200
 And that's a signal that wirelessly unlock your devices if they're set up for it.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.520
 So is it activated by the actors following it?

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.520
 No, no.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.520
 You don't have to swallow it every time you don't have a phone.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.520
 You put it in you.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.880
 And then when you're around your phone, it's unlocked.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.880
 But except for when you put it out.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.880
 Yeah.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.880
 So then you have to swallow another one.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.760
 You have to have it in your pocket, because you could lose that, or someone else could...

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.760
 Take pocket you?

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.760
 Yeah.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.640
 Whereas you can't have it stolen from you if you beat it.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.560
 So, what you could do is you could put the little chip that's in a nice card, and you

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.560
 could eat that.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.160
 And then every time you're walking towards the gates and the tube station, it'll be like

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.680
 you're on Star Wars or something.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680
 Yeah.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:53.880
 And that is why, my Lord, I took a dump, or it was to bury it.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.880
 Okay.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.840
 It is time to move on to fact number three.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.000
 And that is my fact.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.960
 And my fact this week is that a day on the sun lasts both 25 and 38 Earth days.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.960
 Okay.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.240
 You have to explain, because it's always going to feel like daytime there, isn't it?

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.240
 Yeah.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.240
 It's not really going to...

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.240
 Yeah.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.240
 You're going to be confused.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.600
 So, because it's a massive gas body, it spins at different speeds.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.120
 So the middle of it, the equator, as it were, spins around 25 days.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.440
 That makes one day's, but the poles go a lot slower.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.840
 So it takes up to 38 days for them to turn around.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.100
 So I should say that there are fluctuations in these numbers, obviously.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.200
 So 24.7 is usually the number given for the quickest bit where the equator, where the middle

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.600
 of the sun is spinning around.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.160
 38 is the top end bit.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.680
 By asked Alex and I saw an astrophysicist the other night, Dr. Lucy Green.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.640
 And she said that's absolutely true that they do have these different spins on them.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.640
 Yeah.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.640
 Really interesting.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.680
 Actually, they also have differentials spin, because they're gas.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.680
 Yeah.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.560
 I found out this thing the other day, which I told the guys, but I haven't told you yet.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.320
 So I'll ask you as a question.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.360
 So let's assume that there are eight planets in the solar system.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.360
 Yeah.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.960
 How many planets in our solar system orbit the sun?

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.560
 Of those eight, all of them.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.480
 Ah, technically, if you go into a super technical reasoning, we orbit the sun because

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.800
 at the center of the gravity that's pulling us, making us orbit the sun, is in the middle

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.800
 of the sun.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.840
 Jupiter is so large, it's so big that it's pulled the center of gravity out to above the

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.160
 sun's surface.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.640
 So technically, they are orbiting each other.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.640
 That's really good.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.640
 Yeah, it's quite cool.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.400
 I had no idea Jupiter was that big.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.920
 It also has a massively fast day, Jupiter.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.920
 Does it?

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.160
 So yeah, it rotates every 10 hours.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.680
 So daytime, nighttime, you just lost about five hours.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.680
 Oh.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.680
 She's really short.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.400
 It's faster than any other planet.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.560
 And if it was 80 times larger, which is not that much larger, it could have been a star,

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.560
 a star.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.560
 Wow.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.560
 Yeah.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.560
 Well, we're done to us.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.920
 Oh, I think we've been in big trouble.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.920
 Yeah, issues, right?

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.920
 Probably.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:01.840
 Hey, so I found this fact when I was reading a book called The Jupiter Effect, which is

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.160
 written by John Ribbon, who most people know is a massive popular science writer.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.680
 He wrote in "Search a Shrodinger's Cat."

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.600
 And this book is the one book that he wants people to forget about.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.600
 So I apologize.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.960
 I'm glad because you've met John Ribbon, haven't you?

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.960
 I have.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.960
 Yeah.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.960
 He'll be delighted that you're bringing this up.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.960
 Yeah.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.960
 I'm really sorry, but it is out there.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.720
 And it's a really well written book, except for one thing, which it has a conceit of it, which

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:28.880
 is that basically there was going to be a ginormous earthquake at the San Andreas fault on March

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:33.040
 the 10th of 1982, because they believe that all the planets were going to align, and it

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.040
 was just going to set off chaos on Earth, which never happened.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.120
 It was a bestseller, though, but it didn't happen.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:43.280
 And so he's kind of buried that book by writing about 200 more books to separate itself.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.280
 I'm sure he writes tons of books.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.280
 I think they're all brilliant.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.280
 They're all brilliant.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.520
 But yeah, do you think that's the reason he writes so many?

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.760
 I think just so it goes co-order down that bibliography list.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.760
 Yeah.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.560
 I'm just going back to the sun very quickly.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.560
 Yes.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.360
 What would happen if you replaced the sun with a black hole?

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.640
 So there'd be less light for starters.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.320
 There'd be less energy coming from it.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.320
 You would think?

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.320
 Yes.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.280
 So it off-freeze to death.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.560
 And we would get sucked into it, because that's...

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.560
 No.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.560
 There we are.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.560
 That's finally the thing.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.560
 No, apparently.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.920
 So the Oxford University Science Blog looks into this.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.600
 And they found that apparently the planet's orbits would stay kind of much the same, because

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.920
 if it's the same mass as the sun, this black hole, then the gravitational field it produces

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.800
 is about the same as the sun.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.160
 But it would be cold and dark.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.120
 The sun is obviously emitting loads of heat, but Jupiter, it was all my Jupiter.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.680
 Jupiter radiates so much heat, but it loses it faster than it gains energy from the sun,

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.280
 which means that it's shrinking about two centimeters a year.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.280
 That is a year?

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.280
 Yeah.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.280
 Two centimeters a year.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.280
 I mean, it's massive.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.280
 So that's relatively quite small amount.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.280
 Yeah.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:52.440
 Are there planets out there that we've seen exoplanet style that would be just enough atmosphere,

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:57.440
 tall enough that a six-foot person could stand in and sort of like run their life, but that's

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.440
 where the planet ends.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.680
 Well, the only atmosphere.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.680
 Yeah.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:06.760
 So if you were to go to, I think it's Mars, they have a very, very, very weak atmosphere.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:11.560
 And so it would kind of feel like winter at your head, but spring at your feet.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.560
 Wow.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.560
 Yeah.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.320
 So you kind of, your head would be out of the atmosphere, kind of.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.440
 So you have to, what do you have to, where do you spend Christmas?

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.920
 Do you have to go up a step ladder, basically, for Christmas, and then for the spring?

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.400
 So much just lie on the floor.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.600
 Some are collection, just lie down.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.600
 I have one more.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.920
 Do you know what else is fueled by the sun?

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.040
 Superman, according to DC Comics.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.040
 Really?

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.680
 No, this, because once he was bitten by Dracula and Dracula exploded.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.680
 What?

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.680
 Science, guys.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.920
 I've never caught up with a brand stoker novel.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.440
 Wait, hang on, Dracula bites Superman, though, Superman explodes.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.640
 No, Dracula explodes, because Dracula vampires don't like sunlight.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.600
 How do we know Superman isn't made out of garlic?

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.320
 No, it's sweet.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:04.920
 Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.920
 And that is James.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:12.640
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1945, police in Halifax Nova Scotia initiated a campaign

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:19.760
 to stop people from beeping their carhons in Moscow to signal out vial and filthy language.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.040
 And what were they saying in the Moscow?

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.040
 Do we know?

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.040
 This is the weird thing, right?

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.400
 So I saw this on a website called Boing Boing, which is one of my favourite places online.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.160
 They have amazing facts and stuff like that on there.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.760
 And it was a news cutting.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.440
 And I'm pretty sure the news cutting is real, because I found it in other places.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:42.640
 But that's the only thing on the whole of the internet that seems to give any idea that

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.640
 this actually happened.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.280
 Now I see why you were throwing shade at my ham sandwich, in fact, you were drawn attention

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.280
 from your own.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:55.480
 Yeah, fair enough, I don't know if it's true if anyone knows any more than do let us know.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.440
 But I think it's a really, it's a nice idea if it's not true, right?

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.440
 Yeah.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.520
 I think it's the most eloquent way to swear at someone through Moscow.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.520
 It takes a long time.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.520
 It takes a very long time.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.520
 Oh, you're a dick.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.520
 Kind of, yeah.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.520
 Yeah.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.520
 If you're in traffic though, you do have time.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.520
 So you might as well send a message.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.520
 That's true.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.520
 Yeah.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.520
 You're relying on the person who is a dick knowing Moscow.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.520
 Yeah.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.520
 Yeah.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.720
 It's quite funny, because it does sound like you're actually just bleeping yourself as you're

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.240
 swearing at someone.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.240
 So this is 1945.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.240
 That's right.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.720
 What kind of carhons were we at that point?

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.800
 What kind of cars were we at at that point?

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:36.160
 Well, we would have had cars that are not a million miles dissimilar to cars that we

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.280
 have now, their combustion engines.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.040
 So maybe slightly bigger American cars, that kind of thing?

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.040
 Yeah.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.040
 So the 50s is where I start.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.040
 So the clock, what a car is.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.040
 Okay.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.040
 So imagine five years before that.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.040
 Yeah, I got it there.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:54.240
 But they've had horns, like a horn sound, since the very beginning of things with wheels

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.240
 on the road, haven't they?

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.240
 Yeah.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.240
 So they predate cars.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.600
 So they weren't they originally outside the cars, and people like walk alongside carriages

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.000
 with horns, or they'd walk alongside cars with horns.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 What did you do?

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.800
 If you were just walking, you had a, you had a horse.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.040
 Yes, I've heard, yeah, I've read this as well.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.040
 Yeah.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.200
 Pedestrians carried the first carhons to warn cars, and then eventually they said, why do

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.640
 we combine this with the car?

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.840
 I read that there was an early locomotive act, and the idea was that cars used to travel

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.080
 really slowly, and to warn people that cars were on the way.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.160
 Someone would walk ahead of the car with a red flag.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.160
 Okay.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.160
 Was everything about this?

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.160
 Yeah, is it true?

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.160
 Is it true?

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.160
 Not really.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.160
 Okay.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.160
 It's true that the act existed.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.160
 The act existed.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.160
 Yep.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:39.200
 And the red flag thing was used, and you would have to have three people operating a vehicle,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:44.160
 one to steer it, one to stoke the boiler, and one to walk ahead who was called the stalker

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.160
 with the red flag.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.160
 Yep.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:51.480
 However, I think that when the act was introduced, cars were not a thing, because it was

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:57.400
 in about the 1870s, and by the time people started having personal cars, the red flag bit

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.560
 was not observed and have been repealed.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.560
 Okay.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.560
 From memory.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.560
 Yeah.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.560
 That's how it went.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.560
 So, yeah.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:10.160
 I was looking online about sometimes in Moore's code, you know, how on text messages, you

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.800
 know, lol for a laugh out loud.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:16.560
 There's a long list of how they do abbreviations for longer sentences.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.440
 So one of my favorite ones, and this is goodbye, so I want to see who gets this.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.440
 If you were doing a shortened Moore's code of goodbye, it's DSW.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.440
 Why would it be DSW?

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.440
 Don't?

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.440
 Darling?

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.440
 What?

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.440
 No, DSW.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.440
 Oh, you were doing DSW.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.440
 You were doing that for three words?

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.440
 No, it doesn't actually.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.440
 Oh.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.440
 Then I'm not going to know it.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.440
 DSW.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.440
 I would have thought I would have gone for CU, because that would be shorter.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.440
 Yes, it would have been.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.440
 Yeah.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.440
 So what's DSW?

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.440
 DSW.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.440
 I can't actually pronounce it, but James will be able to, because it's his second line.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.440
 Yeah.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440
 I'm not interested.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.440
 It's Russian.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.440
 Yeah, Russian does with that one.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.440
 Yeah.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.440
 You see.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.440
 That's a good bite.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.440
 DSW.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.440
 Good bite.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.440
 And then humor is H.I.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.440
 Humor intended.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.440
 H.E.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.440
 Is humor intended or laughter?

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.440
 We should absolutely start using these after some of our jokes on the show.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.440
 I could just say H.I. after one of my puns.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.440
 Here's another thing I hadn't heard of.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.440
 Hog Morse.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.440
 Have you heard of Hog Morse?

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.440
 Hog Morse, yeah.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.920
 It's from...

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.920
 Hog Morse.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.920
 Is it bad Morse?

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.920
 Is it like Pigleton?

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.920
 Yeah.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:19.920
 It's correct.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.920
 It's basically auto correct for when you're doing Morse.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.920
 It's the most commonly made mistakes when you're doing Morse code.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.920
 What does it mean?

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.920
 Is it like letters which are similar or...?

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.920
 Yeah.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.440
 It's basically called after one example, home becoming hog.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.920
 One example given in the literature is, please fill me in, becoming six NAS, FIMI, Q.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.920
 I see.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:44.920
 So, ME is going to be dash dash dot or something, but then G is going to be dash dash dot

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.920
 without a space.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.920
 Yes, yeah.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.560
 And I guess it is the risk of everything going really out of kilter if you mix up something

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.440
 and then you get out of sync with the person receiving and they think your letters end

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.440
 and start in different places.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.440
 Yeah.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.440
 And then he turns into Goldwoody Gook.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.440
 Yeah.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.440
 So, this was... this whole fact is about a kind of secret message being set up basically

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.680
 in a sort of rude secret message.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.680
 Yes.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.920
 So, I've found another example of this kind of thing.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.560
 Another thing from the second world war.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:12.120
 So, Chinese engravers who are designing banknotes change the design of Chinese banknotes

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.360
 to score points off the Japanese who are occupying their country.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.360
 They.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.360
 Yeah.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:22.120
 So, for example, the one you end up very, very common note, it has a picture of Confucius

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:28.520
 on it and he's making a gesture of prayer almost, it looks quite Buddhist almost.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:35.000
 And some engravers changed some of the banknotes they made so that Confucius is doing the classic

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 sex mind.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.240
 Well, you've used one thumb and finger, one hand and the finger on the other.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.920
 And for people at home, Andy is doing said mind.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:47.160
 A great radio, classic sex mind as he put it.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.160
 Yeah.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.160
 So, they did that.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:54.720
 Here's a thing about signalling out violent filthy language, an article from the Daily Mail

00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:00.040
 from a couple of years ago, mother Lauren Walker had enjoyed a day from hell at the hands

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.760
 of her son Max.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.960
 The two-year-old had smeared their dog in butter and put jam in the DVD player.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.600
 Then he decided he didn't want the fish pie, she had spent two hours making.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.640
 So she then spelt out the seawir, did his alphabets potato chips, did the pitch.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:21.640
 I don't know how that becomes news, but it does take a lot.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.880
 It must be a photo on Instagram when you get picked up to something like that.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:31.640
 I was reading, and President Andrew Jackson, he had a parrot that he taught to swear and

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.400
 apparently he attended his funeral and started swearing really loudly as funeral and had

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.400
 to be taken out.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:44.440
 Taking out my dirty, good service, bit harsh, but just open up the coffin and chuck it in with

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.440
 them.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:52.800
 There is an online service called eggplantmail.com where you can send a message to your loved

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.120
 one.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:33:02.960
 And the idea is that in emojis, an Obergine is a signal for something sexual and this company

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:08.760
 will send a real life, Obergine, to your loved one, and they'll inscribe a message on it.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.320
 And it's supposed to be a signal, it's like doing a real life emoji.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.320
 That's cool.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.320
 It's quite cool.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.320
 It's quite good, isn't it?

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.320
 Yeah.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:22.720
 They describe themselves as 100% phallic, 100% anonymous and 100% disturbing.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.000
 And 100% added maths.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:34.760
 Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts, thank you so much for listening.
