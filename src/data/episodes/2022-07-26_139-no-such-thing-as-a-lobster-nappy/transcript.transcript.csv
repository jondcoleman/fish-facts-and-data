00:00:02,00:00:04,[SPEAKING SPANISH]
00:00:04,00:00:07,[SINGING]
00:00:07,00:00:16,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing"
00:00:16,00:00:18,"as a Fish, A Weekly Podcast."
00:00:18,00:00:21,"This week, coming to you from the London Podcast Festival"
00:00:21,00:00:22,in Kings Cross.
00:00:22,00:00:24,"My name is Dan Shriver, and please welcome to the stage"
00:00:24,00:00:27,"its anichesinsky, James Harkin, and Andy Murray."
00:00:27,00:00:31,[APPLAUSE]
00:00:31,00:00:39,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:39,00:00:42,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:42,00:00:44,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:44,00:00:47,"Starting with you, James Harkin."
00:00:47,00:00:51,"OK, my fight this week is that smooth, fun lobsters"
00:00:51,00:00:54,"travel around the sea inside jellyfish,"
00:00:54,00:00:58,eating their rides as they go.
00:00:58,00:01:02,"So they're in the jellyfish, and they're eating the jellyfish."
00:01:02,00:01:03,"Imagine you were to take an Uber home,"
00:01:03,00:01:05,and it was made out of chocolate.
00:01:05,00:01:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:07,00:01:08,But the jellyfish is a living thing.
00:01:08,00:01:10,So who's the jellyfish eating them before they--
00:01:10,00:01:11,the jellyfish?
00:01:11,00:01:14,"No, these are kind of like baby lobsters,"
00:01:14,00:01:16,and they managed to kind of swim up inside the bell
00:01:16,00:01:18,of the jellyfish.
00:01:18,00:01:21,"Now, come on."
00:01:21,00:01:24,It's a bit early in the show to be laughing at the word
00:01:24,00:01:26,bell.
00:01:26,00:01:31,"Also, it's a bit far out of the '90s to find the word bell."
00:01:31,00:01:34,"So yeah, he'd just eat it until the bell ends."
00:01:34,00:01:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:36,00:01:43,"And James' track, which we all walked into tonight."
00:01:43,00:01:46,There was no jellyfish.
00:01:46,00:01:48,"So yeah, they get inside this thing"
00:01:48,00:01:50,which is called a moon jellyfish.
00:01:50,00:01:52,They eat it from the bottom to the top.
00:01:52,00:01:54,"And actually, these jellyfish,"
00:01:54,00:01:56,you might have heard of these immortal jellyfish.
00:01:56,00:01:58,"And actually, the moon jellyfish is one of these."
00:01:58,00:02:02,"Theoretically, it could live forever, as far as we know,"
00:02:02,00:02:04,if it doesn't get eaten by a baby lobster.
00:02:04,00:02:05,Wow.
00:02:05,00:02:07,"So it just kind of does it mine, because it's like,"
00:02:07,00:02:08,I'm not going anywhere.
00:02:08,00:02:08,You can have a nibble.
00:02:08,00:02:10,That's cool.
00:02:10,00:02:12,They can be killed.
00:02:12,00:02:14,"They're much like elves in the Lord of the Rings, in that sense."
00:02:14,00:02:16,I've got half eaten.
00:02:16,00:02:17,"It probably would be OK, wouldn't it?"
00:02:17,00:02:19,Because the Lord of Jellyfish can clone themselves.
00:02:19,00:02:21,"And if you cut a jellyfish in half,"
00:02:21,00:02:24,I think that's like the myth about the worm
00:02:24,00:02:28,"in that you cut one in half, it will just become to clones."
00:02:28,00:02:29,But the jellyfish have a defense mechanism.
00:02:29,00:02:32,"They fire mucous at the lobsters, don't they?"
00:02:32,00:02:33,They do.
00:02:33,00:02:35,They fire mucous at the lobsters inside them.
00:02:35,00:02:38,"And if they get enough mucous onto the lobster,"
00:02:38,00:02:41,then the lobster can die of like a bacterial infection.
00:02:41,00:02:44,So it's almost like an internal sneeze onto the lobster.
00:02:44,00:02:45,So it's got to eat.
00:02:45,00:02:47,"But the lobsters have a defense because of the lobsters,"
00:02:47,00:02:49,what they do.
00:02:49,00:02:51,They have five pairs of legs.
00:02:51,00:02:53,"And they use one of their pairs of legs,"
00:02:53,00:02:56,like a pair of windscreen wipers.
00:02:56,00:02:58,And they just clear the mucous away.
00:02:58,00:02:59,So that's amazing.
00:02:59,00:03:03,"So lobsters, I had no idea, shed their shells, which--"
00:03:03,00:03:04,so they malt.
00:03:04,00:03:07,"And if they're missing a limb, part of the shell regrowth"
00:03:07,00:03:10,period is also part of their limb regrowth period.
00:03:10,00:03:13,"So if they lose an arm, they're just like,"
00:03:13,00:03:14,"well, I'll just wait for the shedding."
00:03:14,00:03:16,And then I'll do my whole regrowth again.
00:03:16,00:03:16,Yeah.
00:03:16,00:03:18,And there were mortal lobsters.
00:03:18,00:03:20,So what if an immortal lobster gets inside
00:03:20,00:03:22,in a mortal jellyfish?
00:03:22,00:03:23,That's the next.
00:03:23,00:03:26,"Sometimes when I say, in fact, and it sounds completely wrong,"
00:03:26,00:03:28,but then it kind of sounds right.
00:03:28,00:03:29,"Anna will join in and be like, yes, and then"
00:03:29,00:03:30,"she'll be like, they can't be right."
00:03:30,00:03:32,Dan can't be right.
00:03:32,00:03:34,"No, lobsters are going to be extremely old"
00:03:34,00:03:37,"and we're not sure where they could get to be, I think."
00:03:37,00:03:40,And so there's this myth that lobsters might live forever.
00:03:40,00:03:42,Because they don't really age.
00:03:42,00:03:44,So they don't go through senescence.
00:03:44,00:03:46,They don't get weaker and they don't get infertile.
00:03:46,00:03:47,"In fact, they get stronger."
00:03:47,00:03:49,So they get more fertile.
00:03:49,00:03:50,They make better parents.
00:03:50,00:03:51,They get stronger.
00:03:51,00:03:53,"And they keep growing as well, which is quite unusual."
00:03:53,00:03:54,They don't ever reach a limit of growth.
00:03:54,00:03:58,So there are lobsters that have been found the size of the ocean.
00:03:58,00:03:59,The size of the--
00:03:59,00:04:00,The specific age limit.
00:04:00,00:04:01,There must be a limit.
00:04:01,00:04:04,"Well, I think they get killed by their own bigness."
00:04:04,00:04:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:07,00:04:08,So there's a limit.
00:04:08,00:04:12,"This is just a theory, though."
00:04:12,00:04:13,We don't know.
00:04:13,00:04:15,There's a guy called Carl Wilson who studies them.
00:04:15,00:04:18,"And he says, the reason they'll eventually die"
00:04:18,00:04:19,if humans don't kill them--
00:04:19,00:04:22,so most of them get killed by humans--
00:04:22,00:04:24,the reason they'll eventually die is that it takes so much energy
00:04:24,00:04:26,"to shed that exoskeleton constantly,"
00:04:26,00:04:28,because they're always melting.
00:04:28,00:04:30,"The bigger they get, the more energy it takes."
00:04:30,00:04:32,"And eventually, it takes so much energy"
00:04:32,00:04:34,that they're just sat and they die.
00:04:34,00:04:35,Wow.
00:04:35,00:04:38,What I like about lobsters is that they are Doctor Who.
00:04:38,00:04:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:39,00:04:41,They are the closest thing to Doctor Who
00:04:41,00:04:42,that exists in reality in that--
00:04:42,00:04:45,"When they regenerate, so when they molt--"
00:04:45,00:04:47,They turn into a middle-aged Scotsman.
00:04:47,00:04:48,Yes.
00:04:48,00:04:50,"And also, Doctor Who doesn't get bigger and bigger."
00:04:50,00:04:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:53,00:04:54,He does.
00:04:54,00:04:54,He does.
00:04:54,00:04:57,"That's why the Tardis is bigger, or bigger, at the same time."
00:04:57,00:04:59,There are tiny holes in my theory.
00:04:59,00:05:02,"But essentially, it saps loads of energy when they molt."
00:05:02,00:05:04,"So what they do is they lie on their side,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,and they worm the way out of their shell.
00:05:06,00:05:08,And it takes about half an hour.
00:05:08,00:05:10,"And like Doctor Who, you know, when he's regenerating,"
00:05:10,00:05:12,it's really dramatic for a bit.
00:05:12,00:05:14,And then he does take a few days or a while to recover.
00:05:14,00:05:17,And they have to go into hiding for a few days
00:05:17,00:05:18,"to recover, because they're so saptive energy"
00:05:18,00:05:20,while they harden their new shell.
00:05:20,00:05:21,"And they're all defenseless as well, because they're all soft."
00:05:21,00:05:23,So predators can take a bite out of the shell.
00:05:23,00:05:24,Yeah.
00:05:24,00:05:26,"There is, I think, so female lobsters."
00:05:26,00:05:29,"They have this little sack underneath their toes,"
00:05:29,00:05:31,which they collect male sperm in.
00:05:31,00:05:33,And they can decide to use it whenever they like.
00:05:33,00:05:36,"When they molt, they leave that behind."
00:05:36,00:05:38,And I have read that being described as basically
00:05:38,00:05:40,"them regaining their virginity, which I think"
00:05:40,00:05:42,is a stretch.
00:05:42,00:05:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:45,00:05:48,So they've claimed in women's lobster magazine.
00:05:48,00:05:50,I've read that in actually a really good book
00:05:50,00:05:52,called Sex in the Sea.
00:05:52,00:05:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:53,00:05:55,It's not.
00:05:55,00:05:56,It does not make sufficiently plain
00:05:56,00:05:59,that it's mostly about lobsters.
00:05:59,00:06:02,They're making diapers out of lobsters now.
00:06:02,00:06:05,"So they're taking this element to the skin of a lobster,"
00:06:05,00:06:07,"which if you kind of break it down,"
00:06:07,00:06:10,"and you apply it with other more diaper-like substances,"
00:06:10,00:06:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:12,00:06:14,you can use it because it sucks up more fluid.
00:06:14,00:06:17,"So people are going to start be wearing lobster diapers,"
00:06:17,00:06:20,and lobster tampons are on the way as well.
00:06:20,00:06:21,Yeah.
00:06:21,00:06:22,"Oh, what?"
00:06:22,00:06:23,Do they cut the claws off or--
00:06:23,00:06:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:26,00:06:28,"Sorry, this is so embarrassing."
00:06:28,00:06:29,It's jellyfish.
00:06:29,00:06:29,It's jellyfish.
00:06:29,00:06:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:34,00:06:36,"OK, do they cut the tentacles off?"
00:06:36,00:06:39,"Oh, my god."
00:06:39,00:06:41,They're like--
00:06:41,00:06:43,They are making golf balls out of lobsters.
00:06:43,00:06:44,Yes.
00:06:44,00:06:45,Do you remember that classic image you
00:06:45,00:06:48,would see of super rich people on top of these huge ocean
00:06:48,00:06:51,liners hitting golf balls off into the ocean?
00:06:51,00:06:53,When the idea of plastic ruining the ocean
00:06:53,00:06:55,"became a proper thing, they put in laws"
00:06:55,00:06:57,"that you're not allowed to hit plastic into the ocean,"
00:06:57,00:06:59,"golf balls immediately were on that list,"
00:06:59,00:07:00,and no one could do it anymore.
00:07:00,00:07:02,So University of Maine has worked out
00:07:02,00:07:04,how to make a lobster golf ball.
00:07:04,00:07:07,So that's made entirely of lobster shells entirely.
00:07:07,00:07:11,"And so now, it's going to be legal again that you can do it."
00:07:11,00:07:12,So what's the point of it?
00:07:12,00:07:14,"Sorry, what's this hobby that the rich have"
00:07:14,00:07:15,that we don't know about?
00:07:15,00:07:17,"You just get on the top of a boat,"
00:07:17,00:07:19,"and you just smack a ball into the ocean, and you go,"
00:07:19,00:07:20,"ah, handy."
00:07:20,00:07:26,I think you should be grateful that scientists at the University
00:07:26,00:07:28,of Maine are devoting their time to making rich people
00:07:28,00:07:31,playing golf on yachts have a better time.
00:07:31,00:07:32,It's a good point.
00:07:32,00:07:34,"So actually, back to what the original fact was,"
00:07:34,00:07:36,lobster rides on jellyfish in order
00:07:36,00:07:38,"to get from one place to another, don't they?"
00:07:38,00:07:40,"And when they're in their larval stage,"
00:07:40,00:07:42,"which is this really weird stage,"
00:07:42,00:07:43,"whether it's called a phyllisomer,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,"and this is slipper or spiny lobster,"
00:07:45,00:07:48,they look like a circular disk with weird little spider legs
00:07:48,00:07:51,"coming off it, and they cling onto this lobster"
00:07:51,00:07:53,to get transported somewhere.
00:07:53,00:07:55,"But then, when they're dropped off,"
00:07:55,00:07:57,"and they morph into an actual lobster,"
00:07:57,00:08:00,they shared part of themselves in order to grow.
00:08:00,00:08:01,But what they do is they shed the front.
00:08:01,00:08:06,So lobsters grow from the sort of ass upwards.
00:08:06,00:08:09,So you would have thought that they would keep hold of
00:08:09,00:08:12,their little larval head and their legs and all of that.
00:08:12,00:08:15,"But no, that just drops off, and they start from the bum."
00:08:15,00:08:16,The head and everything floats away
00:08:16,00:08:18,and gets eaten by something.
00:08:18,00:08:21,And then they grow up from the bum into a lobster.
00:08:21,00:08:22,Isn't that weird?
00:08:22,00:08:23,And this way?
00:08:23,00:08:24,It's pretty cool.
00:08:24,00:08:26,That's very cool.
00:08:26,00:08:27,We need to move on very soon.
00:08:27,00:08:30,So what else who has been killing lobsters recently
00:08:30,00:08:32,is the Nazis?
00:08:32,00:08:33,What?
00:08:33,00:08:36,There was a lobster who became a belated casualty
00:08:36,00:08:41,of the Second World War after they found an unexploded mine.
00:08:41,00:08:45,"OK, so the Navy divers went down to see the mine."
00:08:45,00:08:48,"They saw a lobster inside it, gave it a name,"
00:08:48,00:08:50,and then blew it up.
00:08:50,00:08:52,They called it Lionel the Lobster.
00:08:52,00:08:53,And they tried to get him out.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"And then they went, come on, come on, and he nipped their hand."
00:08:55,00:08:59,"And they were like, right, you're going."
00:08:59,00:09:00,And they blew him up.
00:09:00,00:09:03,Maybe he was a Nazi lobster.
00:09:03,00:09:04,"All right, let's move on."
00:09:04,00:09:08,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:09:08,00:09:11,"My fact is that in 1892, France built a telescope, which"
00:09:11,00:09:14,was so long it couldn't actually be pointed at the sky.
00:09:14,00:09:23,"So this was for a sort of world's exposition,"
00:09:23,00:09:27,"universal exposition, which France was holding in 1900."
00:09:27,00:09:30,"And they needed a sequel to the Eiffel Tower, basically,"
00:09:30,00:09:32,because the Eiffel Tower was a huge hit.
00:09:32,00:09:34,"And they said, we need another thing that's really big,"
00:09:34,00:09:37,to be the kind of centerpiece of the exposition.
00:09:37,00:09:39,"And there's an article all about this on amusing planet,"
00:09:39,00:09:41,"which is a very good website, recommend it."
00:09:41,00:09:44,"And the tube, which housed it, was 60 meters long."
00:09:44,00:09:47,"The lenses were one and a quarter meters across,"
00:09:47,00:09:50,and it was too long to move when they had built it.
00:09:50,00:09:54,"So they had to have a secondary system,"
00:09:54,00:09:57,"so they constructed to funnel light in from astronomical objects,"
00:09:57,00:09:59,and then direct it with a series of mirrors
00:09:59,00:10:01,into the actual telescope.
00:10:01,00:10:03,"And also, because it was at the world's fair,"
00:10:03,00:10:05,there were lots of bright lights nearby.
00:10:05,00:10:09,"And it was functionally useless as a telescope,"
00:10:09,00:10:11,because it was in the middle of Paris.
00:10:11,00:10:12,So it was kind of useless.
00:10:12,00:10:14,It was broken up for scrap.
00:10:14,00:10:14,It was kind of tragic.
00:10:14,00:10:16,But I think that's amazing.
00:10:16,00:10:18,"It was quite an amazing exposition,"
00:10:18,00:10:22,because they had the debuted to the world.
00:10:22,00:10:25,"The Russians, debuted Russian dolls for the first time there."
00:10:25,00:10:26,How cool is that?
00:10:26,00:10:29,"So you had this big thing, and then next door it was like, look."
00:10:29,00:10:32,What?
00:10:32,00:10:33,And which one of the two do we know?
00:10:33,00:10:36,"Yeah, so egg on their face."
00:10:36,00:10:38,Would have been better if they'd had a smaller telescope
00:10:38,00:10:43,"inside that, and a smaller one like that, eventually, they could."
00:10:43,00:10:44,"Yeah, but so they had that."
00:10:44,00:10:46,They had a ginormous Ferris wheel.
00:10:46,00:10:48,"I think it was the biggest of its time,"
00:10:48,00:10:49,and they eventually had to take it down.
00:10:49,00:10:53,"And the compartments were so big that during the war,"
00:10:53,00:10:56,"they got taken and used as houses, because people"
00:10:56,00:10:59,"who lost their houses, people lived inside the compartment."
00:10:59,00:11:02,"They also had the debuted a travelator,"
00:11:02,00:11:05,the sort of moving escalators that go in the airport
00:11:05,00:11:07,when you were walking on the flat surface one.
00:11:07,00:11:09,They were showing that for the first time.
00:11:09,00:11:11,So they had three different speeds.
00:11:11,00:11:13,"Yeah, so there's a slow one."
00:11:13,00:11:14,"So you're going at a few miles an hour,"
00:11:14,00:11:15,"and then you step onto the next one,"
00:11:15,00:11:16,"which is only slightly different,"
00:11:16,00:11:18,"but some of you're going at six miles an hour,"
00:11:18,00:11:19,and then at whatever speed.
00:11:19,00:11:22,"Because there is, you could do those for one or for ever."
00:11:22,00:11:24,But you could do that until it gets up to about 30
00:11:24,00:11:25,or 40 miles an hour.
00:11:25,00:11:27,It just goes three miles an hour each time.
00:11:27,00:11:29,"And in that way, you could go on a moving walkway"
00:11:29,00:11:31,that would go 30 miles an hour.
00:11:31,00:11:33,Wasn't that the way we were getting around town?
00:11:33,00:11:37,weren't you proposing that as an idea for trains?
00:11:37,00:11:38,So trains never have to stop.
00:11:38,00:11:40,You just walk up to it in the speed it's going.
00:11:40,00:11:43,I'm not sure it was my proposal.
00:11:43,00:11:45,I think Japan's proposed that.
00:11:45,00:11:46,But it's nice that you've attributed it.
00:11:46,00:11:47,Yeah.
00:11:47,00:11:49,"Sorry, I always mix up James with Japan."
00:11:49,00:11:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:52,00:11:54,You guys stopped doing that.
00:11:54,00:11:56,Have you guys heard of the banquet of Mayors?
00:11:56,00:11:57,No.
00:11:57,00:12:00,This was the thing that happened at the 1900 Paris exposition.
00:12:00,00:12:07,"This was a group meal where 20,777 mayors from France,"
00:12:07,00:12:11,"all over France, gathered in a massive tent"
00:12:11,00:12:12,and had a meal together.
00:12:12,00:12:13,Isn't that amazing?
00:12:13,00:12:16,"My god, I thought you were talking about horses when you said mayors."
00:12:16,00:12:17,No.
00:12:17,00:12:20,And then I thought you were using a sexist term for women?
00:12:20,00:12:21,No.
00:12:21,00:12:22,"Is that, I don't even know if that's a thing."
00:12:22,00:12:23,"No, mayors in--"
00:12:23,00:12:26,"Mayor. Sorry, I should have pronounced it properly."
00:12:26,00:12:29,Mayor.
00:12:29,00:12:31,"But this meal, this is amazing."
00:12:31,00:12:32,The waiters at this meal had bicycles
00:12:32,00:12:35,to get up and down in between the tables.
00:12:35,00:12:38,There was one car driving up and down between the tables
00:12:38,00:12:40,to take orders extra first.
00:12:40,00:12:44,"They got through 39,000 bottles of wine."
00:12:44,00:12:47,"There were seven miles of tables, 1,200 liters of mayonnaise,"
00:12:47,00:12:49,"1,500 camembert--"
00:12:49,00:12:50,Mayoronnaise.
00:12:50,00:12:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:52,00:12:56,[APPLAUSE]
00:12:56,00:12:57,Yeah.
00:12:57,00:12:59,"Did someone just go, oh, dang."
00:12:59,00:13:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:01,00:13:02,Where'd you see that?
00:13:02,00:13:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:03,00:13:04,I'm plastic.
00:13:04,00:13:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:05,00:13:07,Someone has never seen this before.
00:13:07,00:13:09,It was incredibly popular.
00:13:09,00:13:12,So it was visited by more people than the population of France
00:13:12,00:13:13,at the time.
00:13:13,00:13:15,"And it was only over about six months, I think,"
00:13:15,00:13:16,was visited by 50 million people.
00:13:16,00:13:19,And the French population was 38 million at the time.
00:13:19,00:13:21,So people were into it.
00:13:21,00:13:23,"Yeah, and apparently the technology of it"
00:13:23,00:13:24,was genuinely astounding.
00:13:24,00:13:27,"And I read about a guy, an artist, Italian artist,"
00:13:27,00:13:30,who went over for it called Giacomo Balla.
00:13:30,00:13:33,And he was so impressed by all the technologies
00:13:33,00:13:35,so that he named all his three daughters
00:13:35,00:13:38,off the back of that wine expo.
00:13:38,00:13:41,"He named his daughters the Italian words for,"
00:13:41,00:13:44,"but in English, light, electricity, and propeller."
00:13:44,00:13:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:48,00:13:50,And you were talking about there wanted
00:13:50,00:13:53,"to do something that was like the Eiffel Tower, but better."
00:13:53,00:13:56,"Well, they asked for suggestions, and a lot of people"
00:13:56,00:13:57,"decided, well, maybe you should just do something"
00:13:57,00:13:59,with the Eiffel Tower.
00:13:59,00:14:02,One of the suggestions was to turn the bottom half
00:14:02,00:14:05,"into a waterfall, and the top half"
00:14:05,00:14:08,into the shape of an enormous woman.
00:14:08,00:14:09,What?
00:14:09,00:14:11,"No, it wouldn't look like she was wetting herself"
00:14:11,00:14:14,"the whole time, but that was a real suggestion."
00:14:14,00:14:16,"And in the end, they had loads of different ideas"
00:14:16,00:14:17,"of what they might do with the Eiffel Tower,"
00:14:17,00:14:21,"but in the end, they just went for applying a fresh coat"
00:14:21,00:14:22,of paint to the spike.
00:14:22,00:14:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:25,00:14:26,On telescopes.
00:14:26,00:14:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:28,00:14:30,So I was looking at other large telescopes.
00:14:30,00:14:32,And there was another two large telescopes.
00:14:32,00:14:36,"Actually, the largest telescope in the world in 1935"
00:14:36,00:14:39,"was reported about in the Nottingham Evening Post,"
00:14:39,00:14:41,I discovered in the British newspaper archive.
00:14:41,00:14:43,And it turned out it was two large
00:14:43,00:14:44,to go through railway tunnels.
00:14:44,00:14:46,And so it was built in New York.
00:14:46,00:14:48,And it had to get to California.
00:14:48,00:14:51,But they had to take it by the Panama Canal.
00:14:51,00:14:54,"So that was rather than being a 2,900 mile journey."
00:14:54,00:14:56,"That was an 8,600 mile journey."
00:14:56,00:14:56,Wow.
00:14:56,00:14:59,Because they couldn't get it through any railway tunnels.
00:14:59,00:15:00,They should have seen that coming.
00:15:00,00:15:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:05,00:15:06,"Oh, candy."
00:15:06,00:15:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:09,00:15:11,Because they had an enormous telescope.
00:15:11,00:15:13,Yeah.
00:15:13,00:15:15,"It was built to spot Martians, actually."
00:15:15,00:15:16,Really?
00:15:16,00:15:18,"Yeah, it was built because they knew"
00:15:18,00:15:19,that there were indentations on Mars.
00:15:19,00:15:21,And they wanted to establish whether or not
00:15:21,00:15:24,"they were made by Martians, were they Martian canals,"
00:15:24,00:15:26,or were they just naturally formed?
00:15:26,00:15:27,What were they?
00:15:27,00:15:30,"And we're still not sure, but we're just not Martians."
00:15:30,00:15:32,"And there's the biggest telescope, which"
00:15:32,00:15:34,has just been built in China.
00:15:34,00:15:37,"And that's also, supposedly, for looking for aliens."
00:15:37,00:15:38,Although the US Defense Department
00:15:38,00:15:40,thinks it might be for something else.
00:15:40,00:15:41,Right.
00:15:41,00:15:43,"But that's a radio one, not an optical one."
00:15:43,00:15:48,So it's a 500-meter aperture spherical telescope.
00:15:48,00:15:49,It's called Fast.
00:15:49,00:15:52,And it is 500 meters across.
00:15:52,00:15:53,That's where the name comes from.
00:15:53,00:15:58,And I worked out that you would be able to get about 3 trillion
00:15:58,00:15:59,bowls of complex in there.
00:15:59,00:16:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:02,00:16:06,And so that would be enough for complex for every person
00:16:06,00:16:09,in the world to have a bowl every day for a year.
00:16:09,00:16:10,And it still wouldn't run out.
00:16:10,00:16:12,Wow.
00:16:12,00:16:15,So is that what it's going to be for two hours a day?
00:16:15,00:16:17,The really cool thing about it is you
00:16:17,00:16:19,can probably see that it looks a bit
00:16:19,00:16:20,different than normal telescopes.
00:16:20,00:16:23,"It's spherical, rather than a parabola."
00:16:23,00:16:25,"In fact, if anyone's listening at home,"
00:16:25,00:16:27,it is a spitting image of the thing James Bond
00:16:27,00:16:29,classed a climb around in Golden Eye.
00:16:29,00:16:29,Is that right?
00:16:29,00:16:30,Yeah.
00:16:30,00:16:30,OK.
00:16:30,00:16:33,Looks like a very big conflict bowl.
00:16:33,00:16:34,Yeah.
00:16:34,00:16:37,"But what they do is a parabola, normally, the data would come in,"
00:16:37,00:16:41,and it would all point to the focal point of the parabola.
00:16:41,00:16:42,But they don't do that.
00:16:42,00:16:44,So what they have is these six towers.
00:16:44,00:16:46,And they have wires coming down on them.
00:16:46,00:16:48,And there's a little robot in there.
00:16:48,00:16:50,And you know if you watch a soccer game
00:16:50,00:16:51,"or an American football game or something,"
00:16:51,00:16:56,"and you have the camera going around the top of this stadium,"
00:16:56,00:16:57,and it's able to take all the shots.
00:16:57,00:16:59,"Well, the robot is there."
00:16:59,00:17:01,And they can move it around wherever they want.
00:17:01,00:17:04,And they get it sort of to focus to wherever that robot is.
00:17:04,00:17:05,Wow.
00:17:05,00:17:06,That's really cool.
00:17:06,00:17:07,"I'm sorry, cool."
00:17:07,00:17:09,"Apparently, 10,000 people had to move house for the telescope"
00:17:09,00:17:10,"to be installed, yeah?"
00:17:10,00:17:11,Yeah.
00:17:11,00:17:15,Because they wanted to be closer to get a good look.
00:17:15,00:17:17,"And the people who stayed, the one condition"
00:17:17,00:17:19,is they have to have their mobile phone off.
00:17:19,00:17:20,That's the only condition.
00:17:20,00:17:21,Really?
00:17:21,00:17:23,"Yeah, because they're all interfere, so it will pick up."
00:17:23,00:17:25,And they'd better like conflicts.
00:17:25,00:17:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:27,00:17:35,Have you heard of the James Webb Space Telescope?
00:17:35,00:17:35,This is very cool.
00:17:35,00:17:38,"So Hubble is in space, because it's much better"
00:17:38,00:17:39,"for looking at the stars, because there's"
00:17:39,00:17:41,no atmosphere in the way.
00:17:41,00:17:43,And the next incarnation is going to be called
00:17:43,00:17:44,the James Webb Space Telescope.
00:17:44,00:17:47,"It's going to be about 100 times better, apparently."
00:17:47,00:17:50,"Don't ask me in what metrics, but will we?"
00:17:50,00:17:54,"They said that it's so powerful that when they turn it on,"
00:17:54,00:17:58,the heat will be able to detect heat coming from a bumblebee
00:17:58,00:18:00,as far away as the moon.
00:18:00,00:18:01,Wow.
00:18:01,00:18:04,"Well, there are not many bumblebees on the moon."
00:18:04,00:18:06,"Well, Buzz Aldrin left a few."
00:18:06,00:18:07,She said so.
00:18:07,00:18:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:10,00:18:12,We were actually getting a robot to put a telescope
00:18:12,00:18:13,on the far side of the moon.
00:18:13,00:18:16,There actually is telescopes on the moon at the moment.
00:18:16,00:18:19,"China has telescopes on some of their small rovers,"
00:18:19,00:18:22,and they've been looking out into the universe as well.
00:18:22,00:18:24,But we only found this out a few years after they'd
00:18:24,00:18:25,been doing it.
00:18:25,00:18:27,So they had secret telescopes on the moon.
00:18:27,00:18:28,Wow.
00:18:28,00:18:29,"Yeah, pretty cool."
00:18:29,00:18:30,One more big telescope?
00:18:30,00:18:31,"Yeah, we need to move on and start."
00:18:31,00:18:32,OK.
00:18:32,00:18:34,Havilius.
00:18:34,00:18:38,"He was a guy who made a telescope, and it was really big."
00:18:38,00:18:40,It was 150 feet long.
00:18:40,00:18:45,And it was so long that he couldn't make a tube to fit it in.
00:18:45,00:18:47,"Because a metal tube would be too heavy,"
00:18:47,00:18:49,and a paper tube would just fall apart.
00:18:49,00:18:51,And so he put it in like a trough.
00:18:51,00:18:54,It was like a trough where all the lenses went in.
00:18:54,00:18:58,And he had to have a team of men with ropes and pulleys.
00:18:58,00:19:01,And they were just there to kind of keep it steady.
00:19:01,00:19:03,Because even the tiniest breeze would just
00:19:03,00:19:05,rip the whole thing apart.
00:19:05,00:19:06,"Yeah, so it didn't really work, did it?"
00:19:06,00:19:07,It did not.
00:19:07,00:19:08,When was that?
00:19:08,00:19:09,It's amazing.
00:19:09,00:19:11,"Renaissance is it, nor is it after that."
00:19:11,00:19:14,"Well, it must be before the 18th century."
00:19:14,00:19:17,Because one of the other things that Havilius invented
00:19:17,00:19:19,were side-looking opera glasses.
00:19:19,00:19:22,So you could have these glasses where I could be--
00:19:22,00:19:25,"look like I'm looking over here, but actually I'm looking at Andy."
00:19:25,00:19:27,And they were called polymer scopes.
00:19:27,00:19:31,"Why, if you've gone to see the opera?"
00:19:31,00:19:33,"What's wrong with my face, then?"
00:19:33,00:19:35,"Well, he called them polymer scopes"
00:19:35,00:19:37,"after the Greek for war, because he thought"
00:19:37,00:19:40,you'd be able to use it in military positions.
00:19:40,00:19:40,Good news.
00:19:40,00:19:44,Their entire army is facing 90 degrees away.
00:19:44,00:19:45,They will never see us coming.
00:19:45,00:19:51,"Wait, yeah, wouldn't you see the person next to you?"
00:19:51,00:19:54,"And they're like, there's a traitor in this area."
00:19:54,00:19:56,They were never really used in the military.
00:19:56,00:19:59,But the reason I know that he's pre-18th century
00:19:59,00:20:01,is they were used in the 18th century
00:20:01,00:20:04,for looking sideways at young women at bowls.
00:20:04,00:20:06,Yeah.
00:20:06,00:20:09,"But it's nice, Andy, that you didn't automatically assume"
00:20:09,00:20:10,that was what they were used for.
00:20:10,00:20:12,It shows you're a wholesome person.
00:20:12,00:20:15,That's immediately what I think it is for.
00:20:15,00:20:18,Don't get invited to many bowls anymore.
00:20:18,00:20:20,I think we have one on the TV show.
00:20:20,00:20:23,We borrowed one from the Museum of Optical Instruments
00:20:23,00:20:23,or something.
00:20:23,00:20:24,"Yeah, they're very cool."
00:20:24,00:20:28,"I've got one last thing, which is that the planet Neptune,"
00:20:28,00:20:31,"when it was discovered, it was discovered within the hour"
00:20:31,00:20:33,of astronomers starting to look for it.
00:20:33,00:20:36,"So literally, they went, I reckon it's about there."
00:20:36,00:20:37,"Oh, yeah, there it is."
00:20:37,00:20:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:39,00:20:41,"OK, it's time for our next fact."
00:20:41,00:20:44,And that is Anichezinski.
00:20:44,00:20:47,My fact is that the first gentleman's club in America
00:20:47,00:20:51,was formed for the purpose of eating turtle soup.
00:20:51,00:20:54,So this is the Hoboken Turtle Club.
00:20:54,00:20:56,"Actually, I haven't looked up to how to pronounce that."
00:20:56,00:20:58,Hoboken Turtle Club.
00:20:58,00:20:59,There we go.
00:20:59,00:21:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:02,00:21:03,I just looked it up in my mind.
00:21:03,00:21:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:06,00:21:09,This was the brainchild of a guy called John Stevens.
00:21:09,00:21:11,And he lived in New Jersey.
00:21:11,00:21:12,And he kept chickens.
00:21:12,00:21:14,And he was plagued by turtles.
00:21:14,00:21:16,And he discovered that these big turtles
00:21:16,00:21:18,were jumping out of the river and grabbing his chickens
00:21:18,00:21:19,and killing them.
00:21:19,00:21:24,So he declared that he would have vengeance on all the turtles.
00:21:24,00:21:24,Wow.
00:21:24,00:21:26,"And actually, a lot of sources say it"
00:21:26,00:21:29,was Alexander Hamilton's idea--
00:21:29,00:21:33,Hamilton of hit Broadway musical fame--
00:21:33,00:21:35,to make this turtle club.
00:21:35,00:21:37,"So Hamilton said to Stevens, that you"
00:21:37,00:21:40,should make a turtle factory on your New Jersey farm
00:21:40,00:21:42,"and kill the turtles, and we should eat them."
00:21:42,00:21:43,And so they decided to do that.
00:21:43,00:21:46,"They created this club, and they killed turtles."
00:21:46,00:21:47,They ate them.
00:21:47,00:21:49,And a bunch of important people joined.
00:21:49,00:21:53,"So Jefferson, Franklin, Burr, Hamilton, Washington."
00:21:53,00:21:55,They were all members of the Hoboken Turtle Club.
00:21:55,00:21:56,They hung out.
00:21:56,00:21:57,They ate turtles soup.
00:21:57,00:21:58,They had the best time.
00:21:58,00:22:00,And that was the first members club.
00:22:00,00:22:01,So there's a bit of detail.
00:22:01,00:22:03,I just want to pick you up on quickly.
00:22:03,00:22:07,"So these turtles were eating his chickens, right?"
00:22:07,00:22:09,"So OK, I've got two things."
00:22:09,00:22:12,"One, turtles incredibly slow, as far as I know."
00:22:12,00:22:16,"Two, I'm pretty sure that chickens are incredibly fast."
00:22:16,00:22:19,"In fact, fast to the point that did anyone see creed?"
00:22:19,00:22:22,"Like Rocky, Sylvester Sloan gets him to try and catch chickens."
00:22:22,00:22:24,That's part of the training for a lot of people.
00:22:24,00:22:26,So they're really quick.
00:22:26,00:22:27,So what the fuck?
00:22:27,00:22:29,You're chicken.
00:22:29,00:22:30,Yeah.
00:22:30,00:22:32,What kind of superspeeds are you lost?
00:22:32,00:22:35,You're citing the seventh Rocky film.
00:22:35,00:22:42,"In the eighth Rocky film, that actually"
00:22:42,00:22:44,going to have been beaten by a turtle.
00:22:44,00:22:46,It's a real insane.
00:22:46,00:22:49,"Well, they can snap out with their jaws incredibly fast."
00:22:49,00:22:50,Turtles can.
00:22:50,00:22:51,Right.
00:22:51,00:22:55,"Once they get close to you, you lay there there."
00:22:55,00:22:55,"OK, right."
00:22:55,00:23:00,"So if you don't seem sneak up on you, then you are dead meat."
00:23:00,00:23:03,"This is my theory, so don't quote me on it."
00:23:03,00:23:06,"But it might have been a lie, because the way that he found out"
00:23:06,00:23:09,"was that one of his servant boys, he sent down to the river"
00:23:09,00:23:10,to find out why his chickens kept disappearing.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"And the servant boy came back and said,"
00:23:12,00:23:14,"look, I was lying by the river side reading my book,"
00:23:14,00:23:17,"apparently romance fiction, weirdly."
00:23:17,00:23:20,Reading my book and suddenly a turtle let down the river
00:23:20,00:23:21,and grabbed a chicken.
00:23:21,00:23:24,So maybe the servant boy was just stealing all of his chickens
00:23:24,00:23:26,and then who'd have blamed it on?
00:23:26,00:23:29,"Let out of the relics as well, yeah."
00:23:29,00:23:30,Do you know what these things are called?
00:23:30,00:23:33,These parties were called turtle frolics.
00:23:33,00:23:34,That's what you'd have.
00:23:34,00:23:36,You'd have a turtle frolic come on over.
00:23:36,00:23:38,But what's really open about that is if you were a turtle
00:23:38,00:23:40,"and someone said, do you want to come to a turtle frolic,"
00:23:40,00:23:43,"keep saying yes, because you'd assume you're wrong thing."
00:23:43,00:23:45,Do you know mock turtle soup?
00:23:45,00:23:46,So turtle soup was hugely popular.
00:23:46,00:23:49,"And in fact, the only reason it's become far less popular"
00:23:49,00:23:52,in America is because they have eaten all the turtles
00:23:52,00:23:54,"in loads of teeth, and they're really endangered now."
00:23:54,00:23:56,"So in the 19th century, you had mock turtle soup,"
00:23:56,00:24:01,"which is made with a calf's head, lovely."
00:24:01,00:24:04,This is Campbell's famously had mock turtle soup.
00:24:04,00:24:08,So you're like it's unusual flavor.
00:24:08,00:24:12,"Sometimes I found a book from 1821 with a load of recipes in,"
00:24:12,00:24:15,and it said that the fetus of the cow
00:24:15,00:24:17,is regularly sold to pastry cooks
00:24:17,00:24:21,"for the purpose of making mock turtle soup, lovely."
00:24:21,00:24:26,"Nixon banned soup from White House, from America."
00:24:26,00:24:28,"From White House state dinners, yeah."
00:24:28,00:24:32,"So this was according to Harry Bob Hadelman,"
00:24:32,00:24:36,"who was his, he was the cheapest staff for Nixon."
00:24:36,00:24:39,And famously was the main perpetrator of Watergate.
00:24:39,00:24:42,"Of Watergate, yeah, he did gel time."
00:24:42,00:24:45,"And he said that what happened was Nixon one day said,"
00:24:45,00:24:48,"I don't want any soup at any of our dinners, OK?"
00:24:48,00:24:50,"And he said, well, it's a perfect thing."
00:24:50,00:24:51,"He says, no one likes soup."
00:24:51,00:24:52,No one's into soup.
00:24:52,00:24:53,Let's get it banned.
00:24:53,00:24:55,And then he spoke to someone who had dinner
00:24:55,00:24:56,with Nixon the night before.
00:24:56,00:24:57,And Nixon was famously clumsy.
00:24:57,00:24:59,And apparently they were having soup.
00:24:59,00:25:00,And he got it over his shirt.
00:25:00,00:25:02,"And he thought, this is unacceptable."
00:25:02,00:25:04,And so he banned soup.
00:25:04,00:25:06,So no soup was ever served.
00:25:06,00:25:10,"Did he say, wait a minute, there's a bug in my soup."
00:25:10,00:25:13,Because of the Watergate scandal.
00:25:13,00:25:14,Even I didn't like that.
00:25:17,00:25:22,President Lincoln's last ever meal was mock total soup.
00:25:22,00:25:22,Was it?
00:25:22,00:25:24,"Yeah, along with like six other dishes."
00:25:24,00:25:27,"But it was a starter, I think."
00:25:27,00:25:30,"Well, they more lax on the last meal thing in those days."
00:25:30,00:25:32,"Well, I don't think he knew he was going to die."
00:25:32,00:25:36,"Yeah, I guess he was on death row, actually, I suppose."
00:25:36,00:25:39,This feels like a last meal.
00:25:39,00:25:43,I don't think I should go out tonight.
00:25:43,00:25:44,"They actually, the turtle club meetings,"
00:25:44,00:25:46,used to become eating competitions.
00:25:46,00:25:47,They morphed into that.
00:25:47,00:25:51,"Yeah, so the famous soup maker for the turtle club meetings"
00:25:51,00:25:52,in the second half of the 19th century
00:25:52,00:25:54,was a guy called John Tarbell.
00:25:54,00:25:57,And he used to arrive two days before the club would have
00:25:57,00:25:58,its meeting.
00:25:58,00:26:00,"And a newspaper report from the time he said,"
00:26:00,00:26:02,"he'd arrive with turtles, flippers tied,"
00:26:02,00:26:05,and eyes are bulged with apprehension.
00:26:05,00:26:07,"And two days later, they'd be in a soup."
00:26:07,00:26:09,So it was justified apprehension.
00:26:09,00:26:11,"And if you could eat more than three plates,"
00:26:11,00:26:14,then you automatically entered the eating competition.
00:26:14,00:26:16,And then I think the winner in 1894
00:26:16,00:26:18,would eat in seven main courses.
00:26:18,00:26:22,And you got presented with a vegetable bouquet at the end of it.
00:26:22,00:26:27,It's just classic boys club stuff.
00:26:27,00:26:28,We need to move on to the next final fan.
00:26:28,00:26:31,So just maybe one or two little kind of other clubs.
00:26:31,00:26:32,"Yes, right."
00:26:32,00:26:33,Gentleman's clubs.
00:26:33,00:26:37,"There was a 13 club, which was an anti-superstition club."
00:26:37,00:26:40,"They wanted to say, OK, look, this idea of 13 being bad luck"
00:26:40,00:26:42,is just ridiculous.
00:26:42,00:26:45,So let's go for dinner with 13 of us.
00:26:45,00:26:47,And let's have 13 of this and 13 of that.
00:26:47,00:26:51,"And let's walk under some ladders and have some black hats,"
00:26:51,00:26:52,and all that kind of stuff.
00:26:52,00:26:55,"But at the first meeting, only 12 people turned up."
00:26:55,00:26:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:57,00:26:58,So they--
00:26:58,00:27:02,The 13th had been decapitated by a dropped mirror.
00:27:02,00:27:05,"Well, they drafted it a waiter to make up the numbers."
00:27:05,00:27:08,"And unfortunately, the waiter was extremely superstitious."
00:27:08,00:27:12,So he spent the whole time howling and trembling like a leader.
00:27:12,00:27:13,I'm going to move this on to our final flag.
00:27:13,00:27:16,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:27:16,00:27:17,And that is my fact.
00:27:17,00:27:22,My fact is that when evil can evils start in the 1977 film
00:27:22,00:27:26,"""Viva Can Evil,"" he used a stunt double."
00:27:26,00:27:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:27,00:27:28,How cool is that?
00:27:28,00:27:31,Greatest supposed daredevil in the world using a stunt double.
00:27:31,00:27:33,Was it for insurance or something like that?
00:27:33,00:27:34,"It was, yes."
00:27:34,00:27:36,"So they booked him, and he plays himself in the movie."
00:27:36,00:27:39,And the idea was that he would make all these leaps.
00:27:39,00:27:43,And he was at one of the shows where they were going to test out.
00:27:43,00:27:44,And they did have a stunt double already.
00:27:44,00:27:47,"But he did a wheelie just to the crowd, and he fell off."
00:27:47,00:27:50,"And the insurance people came in and said, OK, that's what you're done."
00:27:50,00:27:52,And he couldn't do anything else for the movie.
00:27:52,00:27:54,He fell off during a wheelie.
00:27:54,00:27:56,"He was just-- he was crap, wasn't he?"
00:27:56,00:27:57,He was the worst.
00:27:57,00:27:58,He was the worst.
00:27:58,00:28:00,He just fell over all the time.
00:28:00,00:28:01,That's all he did.
00:28:01,00:28:05,All of his actual claims to fame are the mistakes that he made.
00:28:05,00:28:07,So there was a huge thing that put him on the map
00:28:07,00:28:10,was when he failed to leap over the fountains at Caesar's Palace
00:28:10,00:28:11,in Las Vegas.
00:28:11,00:28:15,"So he went over, and he clipped right at the end of the ramp,"
00:28:15,00:28:16,and he went right off.
00:28:16,00:28:19,And so the jump was 150 feet.
00:28:19,00:28:21,That's how far he was jumping.
00:28:21,00:28:26,"When he flew off the bike, he went 165 feet."
00:28:26,00:28:29,He cleared the jump in a fall by 15 feet.
00:28:29,00:28:30,And that's what put him on the map.
00:28:30,00:28:31,But then the bike hit him.
00:28:31,00:28:33,It was really-- it was horrible.
00:28:33,00:28:36,But do you know why he was there in the first place in Las Vegas?
00:28:36,00:28:37,No.
00:28:37,00:28:39,He was there to see a boxer whose name was Dick Tiger.
00:28:39,00:28:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:42,00:28:46,"Why isn't this stuff on the national curriculum, guys?"
00:28:46,00:28:48,I read a few obituries of even cannibal.
00:28:48,00:28:51,And one of the sentences was that he
00:28:51,00:28:53,went into semi-retirement after a failed attempt
00:28:53,00:28:58,to jump a pool full of sharks in Chicago in 1976.
00:28:58,00:28:59,He didn't fall in.
00:28:59,00:28:59,He didn't fall in.
00:28:59,00:29:01,He came off the ramp again.
00:29:01,00:29:03,"He had a real problem with ramps, with ramps."
00:29:03,00:29:05,"But he's a fascinating character,"
00:29:05,00:29:07,because he was one of those guys who
00:29:07,00:29:10,"became one of the most famous people in America in his time,"
00:29:10,00:29:12,then disappeared for a very long time.
00:29:12,00:29:14,Then the revival of nostalgia came about.
00:29:14,00:29:17,And he came back big in the '90s again.
00:29:17,00:29:19,He did a revival tour.
00:29:19,00:29:21,Revival cannibal.
00:29:21,00:29:23,Because that rhymes with his name.
00:29:23,00:29:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:26,00:29:28,He's trying to see the way I have to explain.
00:29:28,00:29:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:30,00:29:32,"I would say far too many, so."
00:29:32,00:29:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:35,00:29:37,"No, but so he was a huge character."
00:29:37,00:29:41,And he led his life like he was the most famous man in the world.
00:29:41,00:29:42,He bought private jets.
00:29:42,00:29:45,He had countless motorbikes.
00:29:45,00:29:47,"He used to, because he'd injured himself so much,"
00:29:47,00:29:48,he used to walk around with a cane.
00:29:48,00:29:50,And the cane was really cool.
00:29:50,00:29:51,It could screw off at the top.
00:29:51,00:29:54,"And he had vials of whiskey inside, six vials of whiskey."
00:29:54,00:29:56,So he could have shots wherever he was going.
00:29:56,00:29:59,"Yeah, he got incredibly drunk before his last famous jump,"
00:29:59,00:30:02,which was actually in the UK.
00:30:02,00:30:04,He was jumping over 13 buses.
00:30:04,00:30:05,Yeah.
00:30:05,00:30:08,"UK, he got incredibly drunk the night before with this guy,"
00:30:08,00:30:10,"Frank Gifford, who was the broadcaster, who was going to show it."
00:30:10,00:30:13,"And he woke up the next day, and he went incredibly hung over"
00:30:13,00:30:14,to look at what he had to jump.
00:30:14,00:30:16,"And he said, I can't do this."
00:30:16,00:30:17,This is impossible.
00:30:17,00:30:18,It's going to fail.
00:30:18,00:30:20,"And so Frank Gifford said, OK, well, don't do it."
00:30:20,00:30:21,"And he said, well, I have to do it."
00:30:21,00:30:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:23,00:30:25,"So, but it's just going to fail."
00:30:25,00:30:27,And so it did indeed fail.
00:30:27,00:30:31,"And he crashed, and he ended up smashing into this wall."
00:30:31,00:30:35,And Frank Gifford said he landed almost at his feet.
00:30:35,00:30:36,And he was spewing blood from his mouth.
00:30:36,00:30:38,And his bones were sticking out of his hand.
00:30:38,00:30:41,And so Frank bent down to his new friend
00:30:41,00:30:43,to see if he was still alive.
00:30:43,00:30:45,And he noticed that he was trying to say something.
00:30:45,00:30:46,"And so he listened to him thinking,"
00:30:46,00:30:48,these could be his last words.
00:30:48,00:30:52,"And he said, Frank, get that broad out of my room."
00:30:52,00:30:55,Just get that lady out of my room.
00:30:55,00:30:59,I just want to be sent back there on my own now.
00:30:59,00:31:00,"Oh, my God."
00:31:00,00:31:04,"When he was filming Viva Keneval, because he didn't"
00:31:04,00:31:06,"have to do the stunts, he just every night"
00:31:06,00:31:07,went off to the bars of LA.
00:31:07,00:31:10,And he frequented most of his favorite bar.
00:31:10,00:31:11,It's called Filthy McNasty.
00:31:11,00:31:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:13,00:31:16,"That was an actual play, very famous place, very famous bar."
00:31:16,00:31:17,And it shut down.
00:31:17,00:31:18,And it got--
00:31:18,00:31:19,"Yeah, hygiene regulation."
00:31:19,00:31:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:21,00:31:23,"No, but when he used to go there,"
00:31:23,00:31:27,"if he got completely drunk, what the owners of the place"
00:31:27,00:31:30,would do is they would go outside and they had a huge sign.
00:31:30,00:31:31,And they'd changed the words from whatever
00:31:31,00:31:36,"they had to, now, drunk inside, evil Keneval."
00:31:36,00:31:40,"So he went to prison, beating up his PR with a baseball bat."
00:31:40,00:31:42,"And I read one account that said that he did this,"
00:31:42,00:31:44,even though both his arms were in plaster at the time.
00:31:44,00:31:52,"He also coined his name in prison, didn't he?"
00:31:52,00:31:55,So he obviously wasn't called evil Keneval.
00:31:55,00:31:59,But this is when he went to prison before he became famous.
00:31:59,00:32:02,"And he did a lot of rubberies, he committed a lot of crimes,"
00:32:02,00:32:04,he fell in with the wrong crowds.
00:32:04,00:32:08,And his cellmate in prison was called Awful Keneval.
00:32:08,00:32:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:11,00:32:14,He was called William Keneval.
00:32:14,00:32:16,But people called him Awful Keneval.
00:32:16,00:32:18,Who are the guards called him Awful Keneval?
00:32:18,00:32:19,"Well, it's exactly that."
00:32:19,00:32:22,"Yeah, they were saying it's a fun pair of names"
00:32:22,00:32:24,to have if we name him evil Keneval.
00:32:24,00:32:25,That's so cool.
00:32:25,00:32:27,"And actually, it was evil with an eye originally,"
00:32:27,00:32:30,but I think he thought it would look too mean.
00:32:30,00:32:34,"I looked into Kenoffal, and he looks like he was a murderer."
00:32:34,00:32:37,He escaped prison three times.
00:32:37,00:32:40,"And eventually, this was in Montana because he was from Montana."
00:32:40,00:32:42,"And they kicked him out of Montana and said,"
00:32:42,00:32:46,"as long as you go to California, we won't chase you anymore."
00:32:46,00:32:48,"And so they sent him off to California,"
00:32:48,00:32:49,and he never came back.
00:32:49,00:32:51,That's the last one.
00:32:51,00:32:54,Evil Keneval's son is now also a dead devil.
00:32:54,00:32:57,He has recreated some of the jumps that Evil Keneval
00:32:57,00:32:59,"didn't make, and I went to his website."
00:32:59,00:33:02,"And it says, ""Want Captain Keneval to jump something bad"
00:33:02,00:33:04,"as for your live event?"""
00:33:04,00:33:07,So he can get into jump over anything you want?
00:33:07,00:33:09,I didn't actually ask for a quote.
00:33:09,00:33:09,I should have done.
00:33:09,00:33:13,We should get him to jump over our podcast while we're doing it.
00:33:13,00:33:15,Just book him just to--
00:33:15,00:33:17,But it won't make any sense in a future episode.
00:33:17,00:33:21,I should have booked him for this one.
00:33:21,00:33:24,So some things on stuntmen generally.
00:33:24,00:33:28,So the Guinness World Record holder for most stunts
00:33:28,00:33:32,"in a movie, in a movie career as well, is Jackie Chan."
00:33:32,00:33:34,He holds the Guinness World Record for that.
00:33:34,00:33:36,He's actually got two Guinness World Records.
00:33:36,00:33:39,So one is for the most stunts in a movie career
00:33:39,00:33:40,of a living person.
00:33:40,00:33:43,And the second one is that he has the most credits
00:33:43,00:33:45,in a single film.
00:33:45,00:33:46,15.
00:33:46,00:33:47,It's got 15 credits.
00:33:47,00:33:49,And that's what he's got that second one for.
00:33:49,00:33:51,It's called a Chinese zodiac.
00:33:51,00:33:56,"And his credits include, obviously, actor, writer,"
00:33:56,00:33:58,"director, producer, exact producer."
00:33:58,00:34:03,Gaffer stunt double.
00:34:03,00:34:05,"So I looked into it because I thought, well, that doesn't count,"
00:34:05,00:34:06,if you're just doing your own stunts.
00:34:06,00:34:08,It's not his stunts.
00:34:08,00:34:11,He does the other character stunts.
00:34:11,00:34:12,Is it a fight suit?
00:34:12,00:34:14,"Yeah, he's punching in stunts."
00:34:14,00:34:15,He's punching in stunts.
00:34:15,00:34:15,Exactly.
00:34:15,00:34:19,"Why are you hitting yourself, Jackie?"
00:34:19,00:34:22,"And lastly, probably my favorite one on that list"
00:34:22,00:34:25,"of his credits, catering coordinator."
00:34:25,00:34:28,"And you can see photos where he's behind, like I know."
00:34:28,00:34:31,"Lasagna, vegetarian way."
00:34:31,00:34:33,That's so cool.
00:34:33,00:34:35,"He's an amazing character, Jackie Chan."
00:34:35,00:34:37,"I said on the podcast ages ago, and he"
00:34:37,00:34:41,said this on the view in America that he's not allowed
00:34:41,00:34:43,to get into fights in America on the street
00:34:43,00:34:47,because his hands are illegal weapons.
00:34:47,00:34:48,I would argue no one's allowed
00:34:48,00:34:51,to get into fights on the streets of America.
00:34:51,00:34:52,And so they say that if--
00:34:52,00:34:54,"OK, a normal fight, if you were having a fight on the street,"
00:34:54,00:34:56,a punch is a punch.
00:34:56,00:34:58,"A punch from Jackie Chan in the eyes of the law,"
00:34:58,00:35:03,"according to Jackie Chan, is firing a gun."
00:35:03,00:35:04,What if he punches himself?
00:35:04,00:35:05,And I can't.
00:35:05,00:35:08,"Suicide, suicide, suicide."
00:35:08,00:35:10,"And also, he claims that his mother was pregnant with him"
00:35:10,00:35:14,for 12 months.
00:35:14,00:35:15,I've got a fact about one of your heroes
00:35:15,00:35:17,who makes incredibly dubious claims.
00:35:17,00:35:17,Yeah.
00:35:17,00:35:20,It's Brian Blessed.
00:35:20,00:35:21,This is from Brian Blessed's autobiography.
00:35:21,00:35:23,"He says that when he was doing the show,"
00:35:23,00:35:26,"Zed Cars, back in the '60s, '70s, '70s."
00:35:26,00:35:30,"He couldn't drive, so he had a stuntman under his seat,"
00:35:30,00:35:33,"working all the pedals, and the gears."
00:35:33,00:35:36,And the BBC then eventually paid for driving lessons
00:35:36,00:35:39,after Blessed became overexcited by his performance
00:35:39,00:35:40,and kicked his stuntman in the bollocks.
00:35:40,00:35:46,We're going to have to wrap up in literally a couple
00:35:46,00:35:47,of minutes because we're going to shut the building.
00:35:47,00:35:50,So I'm just very quickly.
00:35:50,00:35:52,"This is a guy called Ron Cunningham, who was the--"
00:35:52,00:35:54,I think the oldest stuntman ever working.
00:35:54,00:35:57,He did his final performance in Brighton at the age of 90
00:35:57,00:35:58,as a stuntman.
00:35:58,00:36:00,And this is the description of it.
00:36:00,00:36:04,"He, surrounded by a bevy of Brazilian beauties,"
00:36:04,00:36:06,"crushed broken bottles with his bare feet,"
00:36:06,00:36:08,"set himself a light with lighter fuel,"
00:36:08,00:36:11,"stabbed himself several times in the chest with a bendy knife,"
00:36:11,00:36:14,"smashed a big glass into his neck with a hammer,"
00:36:14,00:36:17,and rounded things off by telling his infamous chicken joke.
00:36:17,00:36:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:21,00:36:23,What a guy!
00:36:23,00:36:26,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:36:26,00:36:27,"OK, that's it."
