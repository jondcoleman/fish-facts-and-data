00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
 [SINGING]

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.980
 [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.280
 [SINGING]

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:16.920
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.880
 as a Fish, A Weekly Podcast.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.360
 This week, coming to you from the London Podcast Festival

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.320
 in Kings Cross.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.760
 My name is Dan Shriver, and please welcome to the stage

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.880
 its anichesinsky, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.280
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:39.720
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.320
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.920
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.160
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.060
 OK, my fight this week is that smooth, fun lobsters

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.440
 travel around the sea inside jellyfish,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.240
 eating their rides as they go.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.120
 So they're in the jellyfish, and they're eating the jellyfish.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.460
 Imagine you were to take an Uber home,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.160
 and it was made out of chocolate.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.680
 But the jellyfish is a living thing.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.400
 So who's the jellyfish eating them before they--

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.560
 the jellyfish?

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.160
 No, these are kind of like baby lobsters,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.440
 and they managed to kind of swim up inside the bell

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.720
 of the jellyfish.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.760
 Now, come on.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.240
 It's a bit early in the show to be laughing at the word

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.400
 bell.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.600
 Also, it's a bit far out of the '90s to find the word bell.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.080
 So yeah, he'd just eat it until the bell ends.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:43.840
 And James' track, which we all walked into tonight.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.720
 There was no jellyfish.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.360
 So yeah, they get inside this thing

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.120
 which is called a moon jellyfish.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.720
 They eat it from the bottom to the top.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.040
 And actually, these jellyfish,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.600
 you might have heard of these immortal jellyfish.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.840
 And actually, the moon jellyfish is one of these.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.200
 Theoretically, it could live forever, as far as we know,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.240
 if it doesn't get eaten by a baby lobster.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.240
 Wow.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.120
 So it just kind of does it mine, because it's like,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.040
 I'm not going anywhere.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.880
 You can have a nibble.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.520
 That's cool.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.320
 They can be killed.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.960
 They're much like elves in the Lord of the Rings, in that sense.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.280
 I've got half eaten.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.720
 It probably would be OK, wouldn't it?

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.440
 Because the Lord of Jellyfish can clone themselves.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.360
 And if you cut a jellyfish in half,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.480
 I think that's like the myth about the worm

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.320
 in that you cut one in half, it will just become to clones.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.840
 But the jellyfish have a defense mechanism.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.600
 They fire mucous at the lobsters, don't they?

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.560
 They do.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.960
 They fire mucous at the lobsters inside them.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.200
 And if they get enough mucous onto the lobster,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.560
 then the lobster can die of like a bacterial infection.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.800
 So it's almost like an internal sneeze onto the lobster.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800
 So it's got to eat.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.800
 But the lobsters have a defense because of the lobsters,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.480
 what they do.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.520
 They have five pairs of legs.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.200
 And they use one of their pairs of legs,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.080
 like a pair of windscreen wipers.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.000
 And they just clear the mucous away.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.480
 So that's amazing.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.280
 So lobsters, I had no idea, shed their shells, which--

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.040
 so they malt.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.280
 And if they're missing a limb, part of the shell regrowth

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.520
 period is also part of their limb regrowth period.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.120
 So if they lose an arm, they're just like,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.520
 well, I'll just wait for the shedding.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.440
 And then I'll do my whole regrowth again.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.960
 Yeah.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.080
 And there were mortal lobsters.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.120
 So what if an immortal lobster gets inside

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.920
 in a mortal jellyfish?

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.680
 That's the next.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.800
 Sometimes when I say, in fact, and it sounds completely wrong,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.000
 but then it kind of sounds right.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.800
 Anna will join in and be like, yes, and then

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.880
 she'll be like, they can't be right.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.360
 Dan can't be right.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.000
 No, lobsters are going to be extremely old

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.760
 and we're not sure where they could get to be, I think.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.440
 And so there's this myth that lobsters might live forever.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.560
 Because they don't really age.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.280
 So they don't go through senescence.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.720
 They don't get weaker and they don't get infertile.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.680
 In fact, they get stronger.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.040
 So they get more fertile.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.120
 They make better parents.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.280
 They get stronger.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.400
 And they keep growing as well, which is quite unusual.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.920
 They don't ever reach a limit of growth.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.120
 So there are lobsters that have been found the size of the ocean.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.280
 The size of the--

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.280
 The specific age limit.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.600
 There must be a limit.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.920
 Well, I think they get killed by their own bigness.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.760
 So there's a limit.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.960
 This is just a theory, though.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.600
 We don't know.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.560
 There's a guy called Carl Wilson who studies them.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.640
 And he says, the reason they'll eventually die

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.960
 if humans don't kill them--

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.040
 so most of them get killed by humans--

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.520
 the reason they'll eventually die is that it takes so much energy

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.760
 to shed that exoskeleton constantly,

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.520
 because they're always melting.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.480
 The bigger they get, the more energy it takes.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.440
 And eventually, it takes so much energy

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.360
 that they're just sat and they die.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.080
 Wow.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.040
 What I like about lobsters is that they are Doctor Who.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.080
 They are the closest thing to Doctor Who

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.960
 that exists in reality in that--

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.480
 When they regenerate, so when they molt--

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.040
 They turn into a middle-aged Scotsman.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.520
 Yes.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.760
 And also, Doctor Who doesn't get bigger and bigger.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.120
 He does.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.440
 He does.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.680
 That's why the Tardis is bigger, or bigger, at the same time.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.760
 There are tiny holes in my theory.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.280
 But essentially, it saps loads of energy when they molt.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.280
 So what they do is they lie on their side,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.440
 and they worm the way out of their shell.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.040
 And it takes about half an hour.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.440
 And like Doctor Who, you know, when he's regenerating,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.360
 it's really dramatic for a bit.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.760
 And then he does take a few days or a while to recover.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.040
 And they have to go into hiding for a few days

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.760
 to recover, because they're so saptive energy

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.200
 while they harden their new shell.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.960
 And they're all defenseless as well, because they're all soft.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.680
 So predators can take a bite out of the shell.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.680
 Yeah.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.560
 There is, I think, so female lobsters.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.680
 They have this little sack underneath their toes,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.080
 which they collect male sperm in.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.720
 And they can decide to use it whenever they like.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.640
 When they molt, they leave that behind.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.840
 And I have read that being described as basically

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.800
 them regaining their virginity, which I think

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.280
 is a stretch.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.760
 So they've claimed in women's lobster magazine.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.640
 I've read that in actually a really good book

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.120
 called Sex in the Sea.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.400
 It's not.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.720
 It does not make sufficiently plain

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.440
 that it's mostly about lobsters.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.520
 They're making diapers out of lobsters now.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.720
 So they're taking this element to the skin of a lobster,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.320
 which if you kind of break it down,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.760
 and you apply it with other more diaper-like substances,

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.360
 you can use it because it sucks up more fluid.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.760
 So people are going to start be wearing lobster diapers,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.600
 and lobster tampons are on the way as well.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.120
 Yeah.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.000
 Oh, what?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.640
 Do they cut the claws off or--

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.240
 Sorry, this is so embarrassing.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.040
 It's jellyfish.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.880
 It's jellyfish.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.880
 OK, do they cut the tentacles off?

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.880
 Oh, my god.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.520
 They're like--

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.440
 They are making golf balls out of lobsters.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.040
 Yes.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.360
 Do you remember that classic image you

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.720
 would see of super rich people on top of these huge ocean

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.080
 liners hitting golf balls off into the ocean?

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.920
 When the idea of plastic ruining the ocean

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.400
 became a proper thing, they put in laws

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.720
 that you're not allowed to hit plastic into the ocean,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.600
 golf balls immediately were on that list,

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.520
 and no one could do it anymore.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.800
 So University of Maine has worked out

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.320
 how to make a lobster golf ball.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.760
 So that's made entirely of lobster shells entirely.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.320
 And so now, it's going to be legal again that you can do it.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.640
 So what's the point of it?

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.760
 Sorry, what's this hobby that the rich have

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.840
 that we don't know about?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.440
 You just get on the top of a boat,

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.800
 and you just smack a ball into the ocean, and you go,

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.800
 ah, handy.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.000
 I think you should be grateful that scientists at the University

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.160
 of Maine are devoting their time to making rich people

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160
 playing golf on yachts have a better time.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.000
 It's a good point.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.680
 So actually, back to what the original fact was,

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.840
 lobster rides on jellyfish in order

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.360
 to get from one place to another, don't they?

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.240
 And when they're in their larval stage,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.200
 which is this really weird stage,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.760
 whether it's called a phyllisomer,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.440
 and this is slipper or spiny lobster,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.800
 they look like a circular disk with weird little spider legs

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.080
 coming off it, and they cling onto this lobster

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.200
 to get transported somewhere.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.120
 But then, when they're dropped off,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.320
 and they morph into an actual lobster,

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.160
 they shared part of themselves in order to grow.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.920
 But what they do is they shed the front.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.680
 So lobsters grow from the sort of ass upwards.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.200
 So you would have thought that they would keep hold of

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.640
 their little larval head and their legs and all of that.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.360
 But no, that just drops off, and they start from the bum.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.920
 The head and everything floats away

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.280
 and gets eaten by something.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.760
 And then they grow up from the bum into a lobster.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.760
 Isn't that weird?

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.920
 And this way?

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.840
 It's pretty cool.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.360
 That's very cool.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.560
 We need to move on very soon.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.520
 So what else who has been killing lobsters recently

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.280
 is the Nazis?

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.960
 What?

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.720
 There was a lobster who became a belated casualty

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.360
 of the Second World War after they found an unexploded mine.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.280
 OK, so the Navy divers went down to see the mine.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.160
 They saw a lobster inside it, gave it a name,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.760
 and then blew it up.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.440
 They called it Lionel the Lobster.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.600
 And they tried to get him out.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.600
 And then they went, come on, come on, and he nipped their hand.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.160
 And they were like, right, you're going.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.200
 And they blew him up.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.240
 Maybe he was a Nazi lobster.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.400
 All right, let's move on.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.160
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.560
 My fact is that in 1892, France built a telescope, which

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.720
 was so long it couldn't actually be pointed at the sky.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:23.760
 So this was for a sort of world's exposition,

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.000
 universal exposition, which France was holding in 1900.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.360
 And they needed a sequel to the Eiffel Tower, basically,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.280
 because the Eiffel Tower was a huge hit.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.480
 And they said, we need another thing that's really big,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.040
 to be the kind of centerpiece of the exposition.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.080
 And there's an article all about this on amusing planet,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.280
 which is a very good website, recommend it.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.480
 And the tube, which housed it, was 60 meters long.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.600
 The lenses were one and a quarter meters across,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.920
 and it was too long to move when they had built it.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.200
 So they had to have a secondary system,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.840
 so they constructed to funnel light in from astronomical objects,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.440
 and then direct it with a series of mirrors

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.320
 into the actual telescope.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.840
 And also, because it was at the world's fair,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.840
 there were lots of bright lights nearby.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.360
 And it was functionally useless as a telescope,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.240
 because it was in the middle of Paris.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.840
 So it was kind of useless.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.120
 It was broken up for scrap.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.880
 It was kind of tragic.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.520
 But I think that's amazing.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.240
 It was quite an amazing exposition,

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.160
 because they had the debuted to the world.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.600
 The Russians, debuted Russian dolls for the first time there.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.720
 How cool is that?

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.040
 So you had this big thing, and then next door it was like, look.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.040
 What?

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.920
 And which one of the two do we know?

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.840
 Yeah, so egg on their face.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.920
 Would have been better if they'd had a smaller telescope

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.720
 inside that, and a smaller one like that, eventually, they could.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.720
 Yeah, but so they had that.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.240
 They had a ginormous Ferris wheel.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.240
 I think it was the biggest of its time,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.720
 and they eventually had to take it down.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.240
 And the compartments were so big that during the war,

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.040
 they got taken and used as houses, because people

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.000
 who lost their houses, people lived inside the compartment.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.840
 They also had the debuted a travelator,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.600
 the sort of moving escalators that go in the airport

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.960
 when you were walking on the flat surface one.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.680
 They were showing that for the first time.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.600
 So they had three different speeds.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.480
 Yeah, so there's a slow one.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.720
 So you're going at a few miles an hour,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.840
 and then you step onto the next one,

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.840
 which is only slightly different,

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.040
 but some of you're going at six miles an hour,

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.040
 and then at whatever speed.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.520
 Because there is, you could do those for one or for ever.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.400
 But you could do that until it gets up to about 30

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.240
 or 40 miles an hour.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.520
 It just goes three miles an hour each time.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.960
 And in that way, you could go on a moving walkway

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.560
 that would go 30 miles an hour.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.200
 Wasn't that the way we were getting around town?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.160
 weren't you proposing that as an idea for trains?

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.600
 So trains never have to stop.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.960
 You just walk up to it in the speed it's going.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.240
 I'm not sure it was my proposal.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.040
 I think Japan's proposed that.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.640
 But it's nice that you've attributed it.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.640
 Yeah.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.640
 Sorry, I always mix up James with Japan.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.320
 You guys stopped doing that.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.560
 Have you guys heard of the banquet of Mayors?

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.560
 No.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.160
 This was the thing that happened at the 1900 Paris exposition.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:07.960
 This was a group meal where 20,777 mayors from France,

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.200
 all over France, gathered in a massive tent

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.720
 and had a meal together.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.480
 Isn't that amazing?

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.200
 My god, I thought you were talking about horses when you said mayors.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.200
 No.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.920
 And then I thought you were using a sexist term for women?

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.440
 No.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.680
 Is that, I don't even know if that's a thing.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.840
 No, mayors in--

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.560
 Mayor. Sorry, I should have pronounced it properly.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.080
 Mayor.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.040
 But this meal, this is amazing.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.800
 The waiters at this meal had bicycles

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.240
 to get up and down in between the tables.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.880
 There was one car driving up and down between the tables

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.600
 to take orders extra first.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.160
 They got through 39,000 bottles of wine.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.360
 There were seven miles of tables, 1,200 liters of mayonnaise,

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.280
 1,500 camembert--

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.280
 Mayoronnaise.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.280
 [APPLAUSE]

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.260
 Yeah.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.280
 Did someone just go, oh, dang.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.280
 Where'd you see that?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.280
 I'm plastic.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.520
 Someone has never seen this before.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.480
 It was incredibly popular.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.600
 So it was visited by more people than the population of France

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.520
 at the time.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.080
 And it was only over about six months, I think,

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.480
 was visited by 50 million people.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.880
 And the French population was 38 million at the time.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.120
 So people were into it.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.200
 Yeah, and apparently the technology of it

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.840
 was genuinely astounding.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.980
 And I read about a guy, an artist, Italian artist,

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.760
 who went over for it called Giacomo Balla.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.080
 And he was so impressed by all the technologies

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.880
 so that he named all his three daughters

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.520
 off the back of that wine expo.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.160
 He named his daughters the Italian words for,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.360
 but in English, light, electricity, and propeller.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.320
 And you were talking about there wanted

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.760
 to do something that was like the Eiffel Tower, but better.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.000
 Well, they asked for suggestions, and a lot of people

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.760
 decided, well, maybe you should just do something

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.800
 with the Eiffel Tower.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.080
 One of the suggestions was to turn the bottom half

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.320
 into a waterfall, and the top half

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.800
 into the shape of an enormous woman.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.800
 What?

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.800
 No, it wouldn't look like she was wetting herself

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.760
 the whole time, but that was a real suggestion.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.400
 And in the end, they had loads of different ideas

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.960
 of what they might do with the Eiffel Tower,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.120
 but in the end, they just went for applying a fresh coat

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.320
 of paint to the spike.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.600
 On telescopes.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.800
 So I was looking at other large telescopes.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.720
 And there was another two large telescopes.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.720
 Actually, the largest telescope in the world in 1935

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.560
 was reported about in the Nottingham Evening Post,

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.720
 I discovered in the British newspaper archive.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.120
 And it turned out it was two large

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.800
 to go through railway tunnels.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.720
 And so it was built in New York.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.880
 And it had to get to California.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.360
 But they had to take it by the Panama Canal.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.200
 So that was rather than being a 2,900 mile journey.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.200
 That was an 8,600 mile journey.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:56.720
 Wow.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.200
 Because they couldn't get it through any railway tunnels.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.600
 They should have seen that coming.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.280
 Oh, candy.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.520
 Because they had an enormous telescope.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.960
 Yeah.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.880
 It was built to spot Martians, actually.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.720
 Really?

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.120
 Yeah, it was built because they knew

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.680
 that there were indentations on Mars.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.760
 And they wanted to establish whether or not

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.680
 they were made by Martians, were they Martian canals,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.520
 or were they just naturally formed?

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.120
 What were they?

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.600
 And we're still not sure, but we're just not Martians.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.720
 And there's the biggest telescope, which

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.160
 has just been built in China.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
 And that's also, supposedly, for looking for aliens.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.640
 Although the US Defense Department

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.160
 thinks it might be for something else.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.160
 Right.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.600
 But that's a radio one, not an optical one.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.000
 So it's a 500-meter aperture spherical telescope.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.560
 It's called Fast.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.240
 And it is 500 meters across.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.960
 That's where the name comes from.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.160
 And I worked out that you would be able to get about 3 trillion

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.760
 bowls of complex in there.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.480
 And so that would be enough for complex for every person

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.560
 in the world to have a bowl every day for a year.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.800
 And it still wouldn't run out.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.400
 Wow.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.800
 So is that what it's going to be for two hours a day?

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.640
 The really cool thing about it is you

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.280
 can probably see that it looks a bit

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.520
 different than normal telescopes.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.760
 It's spherical, rather than a parabola.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.320
 In fact, if anyone's listening at home,

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.680
 it is a spitting image of the thing James Bond

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.440
 classed a climb around in Golden Eye.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:29.960
 Is that right?

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.480
 Yeah.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:30.960
 OK.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.440
 Looks like a very big conflict bowl.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.440
 Yeah.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.960
 But what they do is a parabola, normally, the data would come in,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.320
 and it would all point to the focal point of the parabola.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.200
 But they don't do that.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.280
 So what they have is these six towers.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.400
 And they have wires coming down on them.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.160
 And there's a little robot in there.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.080
 And you know if you watch a soccer game

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.880
 or an American football game or something,

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.080
 and you have the camera going around the top of this stadium,

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.920
 and it's able to take all the shots.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.440
 Well, the robot is there.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.160
 And they can move it around wherever they want.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.560
 And they get it sort of to focus to wherever that robot is.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.560
 Wow.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.560
 That's really cool.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.360
 I'm sorry, cool.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.920
 Apparently, 10,000 people had to move house for the telescope

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.800
 to be installed, yeah?

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.300
 Yeah.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.260
 Because they wanted to be closer to get a good look.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.500
 And the people who stayed, the one condition

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.860
 is they have to have their mobile phone off.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.820
 That's the only condition.

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:21.340
 Really?

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.340
 Yeah, because they're all interfere, so it will pick up.

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:25.140
 And they'd better like conflicts.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:35.020
 Have you heard of the James Webb Space Telescope?

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:35.940
 This is very cool.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.860
 So Hubble is in space, because it's much better

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:39.940
 for looking at the stars, because there's

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.180
 no atmosphere in the way.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.420
 And the next incarnation is going to be called

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.900
 the James Webb Space Telescope.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.620
 It's going to be about 100 times better, apparently.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.540
 Don't ask me in what metrics, but will we?

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.060
 They said that it's so powerful that when they turn it on,

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.140
 the heat will be able to detect heat coming from a bumblebee

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.260
 as far away as the moon.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.260
 Wow.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.420
 Well, there are not many bumblebees on the moon.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.100
 Well, Buzz Aldrin left a few.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.100
 She said so.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.340
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.380
 We were actually getting a robot to put a telescope

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.980
 on the far side of the moon.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.540
 There actually is telescopes on the moon at the moment.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.580
 China has telescopes on some of their small rovers,

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.540
 and they've been looking out into the universe as well.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.660
 But we only found this out a few years after they'd

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.260
 been doing it.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.580
 So they had secret telescopes on the moon.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.420
 Wow.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.420
 Yeah, pretty cool.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.620
 One more big telescope?

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.580
 Yeah, we need to move on and start.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.660
 OK.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.540
 Havilius.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:38.540
 He was a guy who made a telescope, and it was really big.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.980
 It was 150 feet long.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.260
 And it was so long that he couldn't make a tube to fit it in.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.220
 Because a metal tube would be too heavy,

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.660
 and a paper tube would just fall apart.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.620
 And so he put it in like a trough.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.780
 It was like a trough where all the lenses went in.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.380
 And he had to have a team of men with ropes and pulleys.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.700
 And they were just there to kind of keep it steady.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.780
 Because even the tiniest breeze would just

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.220
 rip the whole thing apart.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.500
 Yeah, so it didn't really work, did it?

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.180
 It did not.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.860
 When was that?

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:09.460
 It's amazing.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.500
 Renaissance is it, nor is it after that.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.140
 Well, it must be before the 18th century.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.420
 Because one of the other things that Havilius invented

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.900
 were side-looking opera glasses.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.340
 So you could have these glasses where I could be--

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.380
 look like I'm looking over here, but actually I'm looking at Andy.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.620
 And they were called polymer scopes.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.020
 Why, if you've gone to see the opera?

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.940
 What's wrong with my face, then?

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.700
 Well, he called them polymer scopes

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.460
 after the Greek for war, because he thought

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.100
 you'd be able to use it in military positions.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:40.700
 Good news.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.180
 Their entire army is facing 90 degrees away.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.660
 They will never see us coming.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:51.100
 Wait, yeah, wouldn't you see the person next to you?

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.860
 And they're like, there's a traitor in this area.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.540
 They were never really used in the military.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.340
 But the reason I know that he's pre-18th century

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.300
 is they were used in the 18th century

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.140
 for looking sideways at young women at bowls.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.260
 Yeah.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.540
 But it's nice, Andy, that you didn't automatically assume

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.460
 that was what they were used for.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.300
 It shows you're a wholesome person.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.380
 That's immediately what I think it is for.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.060
 Don't get invited to many bowls anymore.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.220
 I think we have one on the TV show.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.340
 We borrowed one from the Museum of Optical Instruments

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:23.820
 or something.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.740
 Yeah, they're very cool.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:28.300
 I've got one last thing, which is that the planet Neptune,

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.700
 when it was discovered, it was discovered within the hour

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.780
 of astronomers starting to look for it.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.460
 So literally, they went, I reckon it's about there.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.260
 Oh, yeah, there it is.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.740
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.420
 OK, it's time for our next fact.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.060
 And that is Anichezinski.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.060
 My fact is that the first gentleman's club in America

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:51.500
 was formed for the purpose of eating turtle soup.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.460
 So this is the Hoboken Turtle Club.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.380
 Actually, I haven't looked up to how to pronounce that.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.220
 Hoboken Turtle Club.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.420
 There we go.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.540
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.900
 I just looked it up in my mind.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.100
 This was the brainchild of a guy called John Stevens.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.180
 And he lived in New Jersey.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.820
 And he kept chickens.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.580
 And he was plagued by turtles.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.220
 And he discovered that these big turtles

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.900
 were jumping out of the river and grabbing his chickens

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:19.780
 and killing them.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:24.020
 So he declared that he would have vengeance on all the turtles.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:24.540
 Wow.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.460
 And actually, a lot of sources say it

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.020
 was Alexander Hamilton's idea--

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.540
 Hamilton of hit Broadway musical fame--

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.620
 to make this turtle club.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.300
 So Hamilton said to Stevens, that you

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.340
 should make a turtle factory on your New Jersey farm

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.580
 and kill the turtles, and we should eat them.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.940
 And so they decided to do that.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.340
 They created this club, and they killed turtles.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.180
 They ate them.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.420
 And a bunch of important people joined.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.540
 So Jefferson, Franklin, Burr, Hamilton, Washington.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.900
 They were all members of the Hoboken Turtle Club.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.420
 They hung out.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.260
 They ate turtles soup.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:58.660
 They had the best time.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.580
 And that was the first members club.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.980
 So there's a bit of detail.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.340
 I just want to pick you up on quickly.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:07.180
 So these turtles were eating his chickens, right?

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.060
 So OK, I've got two things.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.580
 One, turtles incredibly slow, as far as I know.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.260
 Two, I'm pretty sure that chickens are incredibly fast.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.260
 In fact, fast to the point that did anyone see creed?

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.580
 Like Rocky, Sylvester Sloan gets him to try and catch chickens.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.780
 That's part of the training for a lot of people.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.180
 So they're really quick.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.860
 So what the fuck?

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.900
 You're chicken.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:30.420
 Yeah.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.420
 What kind of superspeeds are you lost?

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.620
 You're citing the seventh Rocky film.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:42.620
 In the eighth Rocky film, that actually

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.860
 going to have been beaten by a turtle.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.180
 It's a real insane.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.700
 Well, they can snap out with their jaws incredibly fast.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.820
 Turtles can.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.820
 Right.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.180
 Once they get close to you, you lay there there.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:55.940
 OK, right.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.940
 So if you don't seem sneak up on you, then you are dead meat.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.580
 This is my theory, so don't quote me on it.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.220
 But it might have been a lie, because the way that he found out

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.140
 was that one of his servant boys, he sent down to the river

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.860
 to find out why his chickens kept disappearing.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.340
 And the servant boy came back and said,

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.860
 look, I was lying by the river side reading my book,

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.500
 apparently romance fiction, weirdly.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.140
 Reading my book and suddenly a turtle let down the river

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.980
 and grabbed a chicken.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.980
 So maybe the servant boy was just stealing all of his chickens

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.420
 and then who'd have blamed it on?

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.580
 Let out of the relics as well, yeah.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.500
 Do you know what these things are called?

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.340
 These parties were called turtle frolics.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.340
 That's what you'd have.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.900
 You'd have a turtle frolic come on over.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.900
 But what's really open about that is if you were a turtle

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.580
 and someone said, do you want to come to a turtle frolic,

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.940
 keep saying yes, because you'd assume you're wrong thing.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.540
 Do you know mock turtle soup?

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.980
 So turtle soup was hugely popular.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.580
 And in fact, the only reason it's become far less popular

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.340
 in America is because they have eaten all the turtles

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.340
 in loads of teeth, and they're really endangered now.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.980
 So in the 19th century, you had mock turtle soup,

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.180
 which is made with a calf's head, lovely.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.540
 This is Campbell's famously had mock turtle soup.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:08.300
 So you're like it's unusual flavor.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.740
 Sometimes I found a book from 1821 with a load of recipes in,

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.380
 and it said that the fetus of the cow

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.220
 is regularly sold to pastry cooks

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.700
 for the purpose of making mock turtle soup, lovely.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:26.260
 Nixon banned soup from White House, from America.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.620
 From White House state dinners, yeah.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.660
 So this was according to Harry Bob Hadelman,

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.580
 who was his, he was the cheapest staff for Nixon.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.620
 And famously was the main perpetrator of Watergate.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.300
 Of Watergate, yeah, he did gel time.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.660
 And he said that what happened was Nixon one day said,

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.380
 I don't want any soup at any of our dinners, OK?

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.380
 And he said, well, it's a perfect thing.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.620
 He says, no one likes soup.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.420
 No one's into soup.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.420
 Let's get it banned.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.020
 And then he spoke to someone who had dinner

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.180
 with Nixon the night before.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.980
 And Nixon was famously clumsy.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.340
 And apparently they were having soup.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.900
 And he got it over his shirt.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.860
 And he thought, this is unacceptable.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.420
 And so he banned soup.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.260
 So no soup was ever served.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:10.180
 Did he say, wait a minute, there's a bug in my soup.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.740
 Because of the Watergate scandal.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:14.940
 Even I didn't like that.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:22.060
 President Lincoln's last ever meal was mock total soup.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:22.580
 Was it?

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.820
 Yeah, along with like six other dishes.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.460
 But it was a starter, I think.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.260
 Well, they more lax on the last meal thing in those days.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.220
 Well, I don't think he knew he was going to die.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.100
 Yeah, I guess he was on death row, actually, I suppose.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.220
 This feels like a last meal.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:43.060
 I don't think I should go out tonight.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.580
 They actually, the turtle club meetings,

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.460
 used to become eating competitions.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.820
 They morphed into that.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:51.140
 Yeah, so the famous soup maker for the turtle club meetings

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.620
 in the second half of the 19th century

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.500
 was a guy called John Tarbell.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.100
 And he used to arrive two days before the club would have

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.020
 its meeting.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.060
 And a newspaper report from the time he said,

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.620
 he'd arrive with turtles, flippers tied,

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.660
 and eyes are bulged with apprehension.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.140
 And two days later, they'd be in a soup.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.580
 So it was justified apprehension.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.740
 And if you could eat more than three plates,

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.020
 then you automatically entered the eating competition.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.180
 And then I think the winner in 1894

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.620
 would eat in seven main courses.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.860
 And you got presented with a vegetable bouquet at the end of it.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:27.140
 It's just classic boys club stuff.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.900
 We need to move on to the next final fan.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.660
 So just maybe one or two little kind of other clubs.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.220
 Yes, right.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.340
 Gentleman's clubs.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.540
 There was a 13 club, which was an anti-superstition club.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.980
 They wanted to say, OK, look, this idea of 13 being bad luck

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.460
 is just ridiculous.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.420
 So let's go for dinner with 13 of us.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.780
 And let's have 13 of this and 13 of that.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:51.100
 And let's walk under some ladders and have some black hats,

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.580
 and all that kind of stuff.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.060
 But at the first meeting, only 12 people turned up.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.540
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.060
 So they--

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:02.420
 The 13th had been decapitated by a dropped mirror.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.140
 Well, they drafted it a waiter to make up the numbers.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.980
 And unfortunately, the waiter was extremely superstitious.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.300
 So he spent the whole time howling and trembling like a leader.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.980
 I'm going to move this on to our final flag.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.620
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.900
 And that is my fact.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.900
 My fact is that when evil can evils start in the 1977 film

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.300
 "Viva Can Evil," he used a stunt double.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.580
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:28.420
 How cool is that?

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.900
 Greatest supposed daredevil in the world using a stunt double.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.420
 Was it for insurance or something like that?

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.140
 It was, yes.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.700
 So they booked him, and he plays himself in the movie.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.220
 And the idea was that he would make all these leaps.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:43.540
 And he was at one of the shows where they were going to test out.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.820
 And they did have a stunt double already.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.540
 But he did a wheelie just to the crowd, and he fell off.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.380
 And the insurance people came in and said, OK, that's what you're done.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.180
 And he couldn't do anything else for the movie.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.260
 He fell off during a wheelie.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.260
 He was just-- he was crap, wasn't he?

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.540
 He was the worst.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.340
 He was the worst.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.420
 He just fell over all the time.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.300
 That's all he did.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:05.540
 All of his actual claims to fame are the mistakes that he made.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.260
 So there was a huge thing that put him on the map

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.540
 was when he failed to leap over the fountains at Caesar's Palace

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.540
 in Las Vegas.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:15.180
 So he went over, and he clipped right at the end of the ramp,

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.580
 and he went right off.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.380
 And so the jump was 150 feet.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.540
 That's how far he was jumping.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:26.100
 When he flew off the bike, he went 165 feet.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.580
 He cleared the jump in a fall by 15 feet.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.540
 And that's what put him on the map.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.620
 But then the bike hit him.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.780
 It was really-- it was horrible.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.740
 But do you know why he was there in the first place in Las Vegas?

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:37.240
 No.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.980
 He was there to see a boxer whose name was Dick Tiger.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.460
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:46.700
 Why isn't this stuff on the national curriculum, guys?

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.980
 I read a few obituries of even cannibal.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.260
 And one of the sentences was that he

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.980
 went into semi-retirement after a failed attempt

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:58.380
 to jump a pool full of sharks in Chicago in 1976.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.140
 He didn't fall in.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:28:59.940
 He didn't fall in.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.180
 He came off the ramp again.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.980
 He had a real problem with ramps, with ramps.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.740
 But he's a fascinating character,

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.660
 because he was one of those guys who

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.980
 became one of the most famous people in America in his time,

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.540
 then disappeared for a very long time.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.460
 Then the revival of nostalgia came about.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.140
 And he came back big in the '90s again.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.820
 He did a revival tour.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.780
 Revival cannibal.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.140
 Because that rhymes with his name.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.380
 He's trying to see the way I have to explain.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.420
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.100
 I would say far too many, so.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.460
 No, but so he was a huge character.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:41.180
 And he led his life like he was the most famous man in the world.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.940
 He bought private jets.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.100
 He had countless motorbikes.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.100
 He used to, because he'd injured himself so much,

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.900
 he used to walk around with a cane.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.500
 And the cane was really cool.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.940
 It could screw off at the top.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.660
 And he had vials of whiskey inside, six vials of whiskey.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.500
 So he could have shots wherever he was going.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.940
 Yeah, he got incredibly drunk before his last famous jump,

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.020
 which was actually in the UK.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.780
 He was jumping over 13 buses.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:05.780
 Yeah.

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.220
 UK, he got incredibly drunk the night before with this guy,

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.740
 Frank Gifford, who was the broadcaster, who was going to show it.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.180
 And he woke up the next day, and he went incredibly hung over

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.820
 to look at what he had to jump.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.140
 And he said, I can't do this.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.220
 This is impossible.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.020
 It's going to fail.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.100
 And so Frank Gifford said, OK, well, don't do it.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.700
 And he said, well, I have to do it.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.860
 So, but it's just going to fail.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.820
 And so it did indeed fail.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.540
 And he crashed, and he ended up smashing into this wall.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.460
 And Frank Gifford said he landed almost at his feet.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.820
 And he was spewing blood from his mouth.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.660
 And his bones were sticking out of his hand.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.420
 And so Frank bent down to his new friend

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.060
 to see if he was still alive.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.260
 And he noticed that he was trying to say something.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.660
 And so he listened to him thinking,

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.180
 these could be his last words.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.860
 And he said, Frank, get that broad out of my room.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.180
 Just get that lady out of my room.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:59.340
 I just want to be sent back there on my own now.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:00.860
 Oh, my God.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:04.340
 When he was filming Viva Keneval, because he didn't

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.100
 have to do the stunts, he just every night

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.620
 went off to the bars of LA.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.020
 And he frequented most of his favorite bar.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.500
 It's called Filthy McNasty.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.700
 That was an actual play, very famous place, very famous bar.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.620
 And it shut down.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.460
 And it got--

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.780
 Yeah, hygiene regulation.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.780
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.820
 No, but when he used to go there,

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:27.660
 if he got completely drunk, what the owners of the place

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.540
 would do is they would go outside and they had a huge sign.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:31.900
 And they'd changed the words from whatever

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:36.300
 they had to, now, drunk inside, evil Keneval.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.700
 So he went to prison, beating up his PR with a baseball bat.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.340
 And I read one account that said that he did this,

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.980
 even though both his arms were in plaster at the time.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:52.740
 He also coined his name in prison, didn't he?

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.100
 So he obviously wasn't called evil Keneval.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:59.620
 But this is when he went to prison before he became famous.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.620
 And he did a lot of rubberies, he committed a lot of crimes,

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.180
 he fell in with the wrong crowds.

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:08.100
 And his cellmate in prison was called Awful Keneval.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.580
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.340
 He was called William Keneval.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.060
 But people called him Awful Keneval.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.100
 Who are the guards called him Awful Keneval?

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.180
 Well, it's exactly that.

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.500
 Yeah, they were saying it's a fun pair of names

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.180
 to have if we name him evil Keneval.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.220
 That's so cool.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.500
 And actually, it was evil with an eye originally,

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.220
 but I think he thought it would look too mean.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:34.020
 I looked into Kenoffal, and he looks like he was a murderer.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.300
 He escaped prison three times.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.620
 And eventually, this was in Montana because he was from Montana.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.740
 And they kicked him out of Montana and said,

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.540
 as long as you go to California, we won't chase you anymore.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.060
 And so they sent him off to California,

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.100
 and he never came back.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.260
 That's the last one.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.300
 Evil Keneval's son is now also a dead devil.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.180
 He has recreated some of the jumps that Evil Keneval

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.300
 didn't make, and I went to his website.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.380
 And it says, "Want Captain Keneval to jump something bad

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.660
 as for your live event?"

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.620
 So he can get into jump over anything you want?

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.020
 I didn't actually ask for a quote.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:09.900
 I should have done.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.220
 We should get him to jump over our podcast while we're doing it.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.580
 Just book him just to--

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.900
 But it won't make any sense in a future episode.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.180
 I should have booked him for this one.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.740
 So some things on stuntmen generally.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.820
 So the Guinness World Record holder for most stunts

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:32.860
 in a movie, in a movie career as well, is Jackie Chan.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.700
 He holds the Guinness World Record for that.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.660
 He's actually got two Guinness World Records.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.060
 So one is for the most stunts in a movie career

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.420
 of a living person.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.340
 And the second one is that he has the most credits

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.340
 in a single film.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.540
 15.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.780
 It's got 15 credits.

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.580
 And that's what he's got that second one for.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.620
 It's called a Chinese zodiac.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:56.260
 And his credits include, obviously, actor, writer,

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.820
 director, producer, exact producer.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:03.140
 Gaffer stunt double.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.620
 So I looked into it because I thought, well, that doesn't count,

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.980
 if you're just doing your own stunts.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.060
 It's not his stunts.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.220
 He does the other character stunts.

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.460
 Is it a fight suit?

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.180
 Yeah, he's punching in stunts.

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.140
 He's punching in stunts.

00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:15.660
 Exactly.

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:19.780
 Why are you hitting yourself, Jackie?

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.300
 And lastly, probably my favorite one on that list

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.780
 of his credits, catering coordinator.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.540
 And you can see photos where he's behind, like I know.

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.020
 Lasagna, vegetarian way.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.500
 That's so cool.

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.820
 He's an amazing character, Jackie Chan.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.820
 I said on the podcast ages ago, and he

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:41.180
 said this on the view in America that he's not allowed

00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:43.940
 to get into fights in America on the street

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.500
 because his hands are illegal weapons.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.580
 I would argue no one's allowed

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.020
 to get into fights on the streets of America.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.500
 And so they say that if--

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.860
 OK, a normal fight, if you were having a fight on the street,

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.180
 a punch is a punch.

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:58.860
 A punch from Jackie Chan in the eyes of the law,

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:03.140
 according to Jackie Chan, is firing a gun.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.620
 What if he punches himself?

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.140
 And I can't.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:08.420
 Suicide, suicide, suicide.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.780
 And also, he claims that his mother was pregnant with him

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.260
 for 12 months.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.780
 I've got a fact about one of your heroes

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.460
 who makes incredibly dubious claims.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:17.960
 Yeah.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.020
 It's Brian Blessed.

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.740
 This is from Brian Blessed's autobiography.

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.300
 He says that when he was doing the show,

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.820
 Zed Cars, back in the '60s, '70s, '70s.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.380
 He couldn't drive, so he had a stuntman under his seat,

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.300
 working all the pedals, and the gears.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.500
 And the BBC then eventually paid for driving lessons

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.020
 after Blessed became overexcited by his performance

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.700
 and kicked his stuntman in the bollocks.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:46.460
 We're going to have to wrap up in literally a couple

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:47.900
 of minutes because we're going to shut the building.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.020
 So I'm just very quickly.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.540
 This is a guy called Ron Cunningham, who was the--

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.180
 I think the oldest stuntman ever working.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.540
 He did his final performance in Brighton at the age of 90

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.580
 as a stuntman.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.580
 And this is the description of it.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:04.100
 He, surrounded by a bevy of Brazilian beauties,

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.540
 crushed broken bottles with his bare feet,

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.780
 set himself a light with lighter fuel,

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.900
 stabbed himself several times in the chest with a bendy knife,

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.700
 smashed a big glass into his neck with a hammer,

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.940
 and rounded things off by telling his infamous chicken joke.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.420
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.220
 What a guy!

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.580

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:27.660
 OK, that's it.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.700
 That's all of our facts.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.420
 Thank you so much for being here.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.420
