4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:16,920
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,880
 as a Fish, A Weekly Podcast.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,360
 This week, coming to you from the London Podcast Festival

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,320
 in Kings Cross.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,760
 My name is Dan Shriver, and please welcome to the stage

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,880
 its anichesinsky, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,280
 [APPLAUSE]

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:39,720
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,320
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,920
 and in no particular order, here we go.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,160
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,060
 OK, my fight this week is that smooth, fun lobsters

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,440
 travel around the sea inside jellyfish,

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,240
 eating their rides as they go.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,120
 So they're in the jellyfish, and they're eating the jellyfish.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,460
 Imagine you were to take an Uber home,

20
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,160
 and it was made out of chocolate.

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,360
 [LAUGHTER]

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,680
 But the jellyfish is a living thing.

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,400
 So who's the jellyfish eating them before they--

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,560
 the jellyfish?

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,160
 No, these are kind of like baby lobsters,

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,440
 and they managed to kind of swim up inside the bell

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,720
 of the jellyfish.

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,760
 Now, come on.

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,240
 It's a bit early in the show to be laughing at the word

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,400
 bell.

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,600
 Also, it's a bit far out of the '90s to find the word bell.

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,080
 So yeah, he'd just eat it until the bell ends.

33
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,040
 [LAUGHTER]

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:43,840
 And James' track, which we all walked into tonight.

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,720
 There was no jellyfish.

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,360
 So yeah, they get inside this thing

37
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,120
 which is called a moon jellyfish.

38
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,720
 They eat it from the bottom to the top.

39
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,040
 And actually, these jellyfish,

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,600
 you might have heard of these immortal jellyfish.

41
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,840
 And actually, the moon jellyfish is one of these.

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,200
 Theoretically, it could live forever, as far as we know,

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,240
 if it doesn't get eaten by a baby lobster.

44
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
 Wow.

45
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,120
 So it just kind of does it mine, because it's like,

46
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,040
 I'm not going anywhere.

47
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,880
 You can have a nibble.

48
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,520
 That's cool.

49
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,320
 They can be killed.

50
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,960
 They're much like elves in the Lord of the Rings, in that sense.

51
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,280
 I've got half eaten.

52
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,720
 It probably would be OK, wouldn't it?

53
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,440
 Because the Lord of Jellyfish can clone themselves.

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,360
 And if you cut a jellyfish in half,

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,480
 I think that's like the myth about the worm

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,320
 in that you cut one in half, it will just become to clones.

57
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,840
 But the jellyfish have a defense mechanism.

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,600
 They fire mucous at the lobsters, don't they?

59
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,560
 They do.

60
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,960
 They fire mucous at the lobsters inside them.

61
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,200
 And if they get enough mucous onto the lobster,

62
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,560
 then the lobster can die of like a bacterial infection.

63
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,800
 So it's almost like an internal sneeze onto the lobster.

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
 So it's got to eat.

65
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
 But the lobsters have a defense because of the lobsters,

66
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,480
 what they do.

67
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,520
 They have five pairs of legs.

68
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,200
 And they use one of their pairs of legs,

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,080
 like a pair of windscreen wipers.

70
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,000
 And they just clear the mucous away.

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,480
 So that's amazing.

72
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,280
 So lobsters, I had no idea, shed their shells, which--

73
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,040
 so they malt.

74
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,280
 And if they're missing a limb, part of the shell regrowth

75
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,520
 period is also part of their limb regrowth period.

76
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,120
 So if they lose an arm, they're just like,

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,520
 well, I'll just wait for the shedding.

78
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,440
 And then I'll do my whole regrowth again.

79
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,960
 Yeah.

80
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,080
 And there were mortal lobsters.

81
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,120
 So what if an immortal lobster gets inside

82
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,920
 in a mortal jellyfish?

83
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,680
 That's the next.

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,800
 Sometimes when I say, in fact, and it sounds completely wrong,

85
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,000
 but then it kind of sounds right.

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
 Anna will join in and be like, yes, and then

87
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,880
 she'll be like, they can't be right.

88
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,360
 Dan can't be right.

89
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,000
 No, lobsters are going to be extremely old

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,760
 and we're not sure where they could get to be, I think.

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,440
 And so there's this myth that lobsters might live forever.

92
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,560
 Because they don't really age.

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,280
 So they don't go through senescence.

94
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,720
 They don't get weaker and they don't get infertile.

95
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,680
 In fact, they get stronger.

96
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,040
 So they get more fertile.

97
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,120
 They make better parents.

98
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,280
 They get stronger.

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,400
 And they keep growing as well, which is quite unusual.

100
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,920
 They don't ever reach a limit of growth.

101
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,120
 So there are lobsters that have been found the size of the ocean.

102
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,280
 The size of the--

103
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,280
 The specific age limit.

104
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,600
 There must be a limit.

105
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,920
 Well, I think they get killed by their own bigness.

106
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,760
 [LAUGHTER]

107
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
 So there's a limit.

108
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,960
 This is just a theory, though.

109
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,600
 We don't know.

110
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,560
 There's a guy called Carl Wilson who studies them.

111
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,640
 And he says, the reason they'll eventually die

112
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,960
 if humans don't kill them--

113
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,040
 so most of them get killed by humans--

114
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,520
 the reason they'll eventually die is that it takes so much energy

115
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,760
 to shed that exoskeleton constantly,

116
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,520
 because they're always melting.

117
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,480
 The bigger they get, the more energy it takes.

118
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,440
 And eventually, it takes so much energy

119
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,360
 that they're just sat and they die.

120
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,080
 Wow.

121
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,040
 What I like about lobsters is that they are Doctor Who.

122
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,760
 [LAUGHTER]

123
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,080
 They are the closest thing to Doctor Who

124
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,960
 that exists in reality in that--

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,480
 When they regenerate, so when they molt--

126
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,040
 They turn into a middle-aged Scotsman.

127
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,520
 Yes.

128
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,760
 And also, Doctor Who doesn't get bigger and bigger.

129
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,600
 [LAUGHTER]

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,120
 He does.

131
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,440
 He does.

132
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,680
 That's why the Tardis is bigger, or bigger, at the same time.

133
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,760
 There are tiny holes in my theory.

134
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,280
 But essentially, it saps loads of energy when they molt.

135
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,280
 So what they do is they lie on their side,

136
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,440
 and they worm the way out of their shell.

137
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,040
 And it takes about half an hour.

138
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,440
 And like Doctor Who, you know, when he's regenerating,

139
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,360
 it's really dramatic for a bit.

140
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,760
 And then he does take a few days or a while to recover.

141
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,040
 And they have to go into hiding for a few days

142
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,760
 to recover, because they're so saptive energy

143
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,200
 while they harden their new shell.

144
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,960
 And they're all defenseless as well, because they're all soft.

145
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,680
 So predators can take a bite out of the shell.

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
 Yeah.

147
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,560
 There is, I think, so female lobsters.

148
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,680
 They have this little sack underneath their toes,

149
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,080
 which they collect male sperm in.

150
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,720
 And they can decide to use it whenever they like.

151
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,640
 When they molt, they leave that behind.

152
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,840
 And I have read that being described as basically

153
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,800
 them regaining their virginity, which I think

154
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,280
 is a stretch.

155
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,040
 [LAUGHTER]

156
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,760
 So they've claimed in women's lobster magazine.

157
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,640
 I've read that in actually a really good book

158
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,120
 called Sex in the Sea.

159
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
 Oh, yeah.

160
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,400
 It's not.

161
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,720
 It does not make sufficiently plain

162
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,440
 that it's mostly about lobsters.

163
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,520
 They're making diapers out of lobsters now.

164
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,720
 So they're taking this element to the skin of a lobster,

165
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,320
 which if you kind of break it down,

166
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,760
 and you apply it with other more diaper-like substances,

167
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,400
 [LAUGHTER]

168
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,360
 you can use it because it sucks up more fluid.

169
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,760
 So people are going to start be wearing lobster diapers,

170
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,600
 and lobster tampons are on the way as well.

171
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,120
 Yeah.

172
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,000
 Oh, what?

173
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,640
 Do they cut the claws off or--

174
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,200
 [LAUGHTER]

175
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,240
 Sorry, this is so embarrassing.

176
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,040
 It's jellyfish.

177
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,880
 It's jellyfish.

178
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,400
 [LAUGHTER]

179
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,880
 OK, do they cut the tentacles off?

180
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,880
 Oh, my god.

181
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,520
 They're like--

182
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,440
 They are making golf balls out of lobsters.

183
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,040
 Yes.

184
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,360
 Do you remember that classic image you

185
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,720
 would see of super rich people on top of these huge ocean

186
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,080
 liners hitting golf balls off into the ocean?

187
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,920
 When the idea of plastic ruining the ocean

188
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,400
 became a proper thing, they put in laws

189
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,720
 that you're not allowed to hit plastic into the ocean,

190
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,600
 golf balls immediately were on that list,

191
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,520
 and no one could do it anymore.

192
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,800
 So University of Maine has worked out

193
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,320
 how to make a lobster golf ball.

194
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,760
 So that's made entirely of lobster shells entirely.

195
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,320
 And so now, it's going to be legal again that you can do it.

196
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,640
 So what's the point of it?

197
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,760
 Sorry, what's this hobby that the rich have

198
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,840
 that we don't know about?

199
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,440
 You just get on the top of a boat,

200
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,800
 and you just smack a ball into the ocean, and you go,

201
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
 ah, handy.

202
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,000
 I think you should be grateful that scientists at the University

203
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,160
 of Maine are devoting their time to making rich people

204
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,160
 playing golf on yachts have a better time.

205
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,000
 It's a good point.

206
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,680
 So actually, back to what the original fact was,

207
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,840
 lobster rides on jellyfish in order

208
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,360
 to get from one place to another, don't they?

209
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,240
 And when they're in their larval stage,

210
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,200
 which is this really weird stage,

211
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,760
 whether it's called a phyllisomer,

212
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,440
 and this is slipper or spiny lobster,

213
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,800
 they look like a circular disk with weird little spider legs

214
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,080
 coming off it, and they cling onto this lobster

215
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,200
 to get transported somewhere.

216
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,120
 But then, when they're dropped off,

217
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,320
 and they morph into an actual lobster,

218
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,160
 they shared part of themselves in order to grow.

219
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,920
 But what they do is they shed the front.

220
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,680
 So lobsters grow from the sort of ass upwards.

221
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,200
 So you would have thought that they would keep hold of

222
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,640
 their little larval head and their legs and all of that.

223
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,360
 But no, that just drops off, and they start from the bum.

224
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,920
 The head and everything floats away

225
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,280
 and gets eaten by something.

226
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,760
 And then they grow up from the bum into a lobster.

227
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
 Isn't that weird?

228
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,920
 And this way?

229
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,840
 It's pretty cool.

230
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,360
 That's very cool.

231
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,560
 We need to move on very soon.

232
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,520
 So what else who has been killing lobsters recently

233
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,280
 is the Nazis?

234
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,960
 What?

235
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,720
 There was a lobster who became a belated casualty

236
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,360
 of the Second World War after they found an unexploded mine.

237
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,280
 OK, so the Navy divers went down to see the mine.

238
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,160
 They saw a lobster inside it, gave it a name,

239
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,760
 and then blew it up.

240
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,440
 They called it Lionel the Lobster.

241
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,600
 And they tried to get him out.

242
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
 And then they went, come on, come on, and he nipped their hand.

243
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,160
 And they were like, right, you're going.

244
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,200
 And they blew him up.

245
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,240
 Maybe he was a Nazi lobster.

246
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,400
 All right, let's move on.

247
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,160
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

248
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,560
 My fact is that in 1892, France built a telescope, which

249
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,720
 was so long it couldn't actually be pointed at the sky.

250
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:23,760
 So this was for a sort of world's exposition,

251
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,000
 universal exposition, which France was holding in 1900.

252
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,360
 And they needed a sequel to the Eiffel Tower, basically,

253
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,280
 because the Eiffel Tower was a huge hit.

254
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,480
 And they said, we need another thing that's really big,

255
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,040
 to be the kind of centerpiece of the exposition.

256
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,080
 And there's an article all about this on amusing planet,

257
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,280
 which is a very good website, recommend it.

258
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,480
 And the tube, which housed it, was 60 meters long.

259
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,600
 The lenses were one and a quarter meters across,

260
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,920
 and it was too long to move when they had built it.

261
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,200
 So they had to have a secondary system,

262
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,840
 so they constructed to funnel light in from astronomical objects,

263
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,440
 and then direct it with a series of mirrors

264
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,320
 into the actual telescope.

265
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,840
 And also, because it was at the world's fair,

266
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840
 there were lots of bright lights nearby.

267
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,360
 And it was functionally useless as a telescope,

268
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,240
 because it was in the middle of Paris.

269
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,840
 So it was kind of useless.

270
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,120
 It was broken up for scrap.

271
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,880
 It was kind of tragic.

272
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,520
 But I think that's amazing.

273
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,240
 It was quite an amazing exposition,

274
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,160
 because they had the debuted to the world.

275
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,600
 The Russians, debuted Russian dolls for the first time there.

276
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,720
 How cool is that?

277
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
 So you had this big thing, and then next door it was like, look.

278
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,040
 What?

279
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,920
 And which one of the two do we know?

280
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,840
 Yeah, so egg on their face.

281
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,920
 Would have been better if they'd had a smaller telescope

282
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,720
 inside that, and a smaller one like that, eventually, they could.

283
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
 Yeah, but so they had that.

284
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,240
 They had a ginormous Ferris wheel.

285
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
 I think it was the biggest of its time,

286
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,720
 and they eventually had to take it down.

287
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,240
 And the compartments were so big that during the war,

288
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,040
 they got taken and used as houses, because people

289
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,000
 who lost their houses, people lived inside the compartment.

290
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,840
 They also had the debuted a travelator,

291
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,600
 the sort of moving escalators that go in the airport

292
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,960
 when you were walking on the flat surface one.

293
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,680
 They were showing that for the first time.

294
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,600
 So they had three different speeds.

295
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,480
 Yeah, so there's a slow one.

296
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,720
 So you're going at a few miles an hour,

297
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,840
 and then you step onto the next one,

298
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
 which is only slightly different,

299
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,040
 but some of you're going at six miles an hour,

300
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
 and then at whatever speed.

301
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,520
 Because there is, you could do those for one or for ever.

302
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,400
 But you could do that until it gets up to about 30

303
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,240
 or 40 miles an hour.

304
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,520
 It just goes three miles an hour each time.

305
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,960
 And in that way, you could go on a moving walkway

306
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,560
 that would go 30 miles an hour.

307
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,200
 Wasn't that the way we were getting around town?

308
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,160
 weren't you proposing that as an idea for trains?

309
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,600
 So trains never have to stop.

310
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,960
 You just walk up to it in the speed it's going.

311
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,240
 I'm not sure it was my proposal.

312
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,040
 I think Japan's proposed that.

313
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,640
 But it's nice that you've attributed it.

314
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
 Yeah.

315
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
 Sorry, I always mix up James with Japan.

316
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,440
 [LAUGHTER]

317
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,320
 You guys stopped doing that.

318
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,560
 Have you guys heard of the banquet of Mayors?

319
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
 No.

320
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,160
 This was the thing that happened at the 1900 Paris exposition.

321
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:07,960
 This was a group meal where 20,777 mayors from France,

322
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,200
 all over France, gathered in a massive tent

323
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,720
 and had a meal together.

324
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,480
 Isn't that amazing?

325
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,200
 My god, I thought you were talking about horses when you said mayors.

326
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
 No.

327
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,920
 And then I thought you were using a sexist term for women?

328
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,440
 No.

329
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,680
 Is that, I don't even know if that's a thing.

330
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,840
 No, mayors in--

331
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,560
 Mayor. Sorry, I should have pronounced it properly.

332
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,080
 Mayor.

333
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,040
 But this meal, this is amazing.

334
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,800
 The waiters at this meal had bicycles

335
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,240
 to get up and down in between the tables.

336
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,880
 There was one car driving up and down between the tables

337
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,600
 to take orders extra first.

338
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,160
 They got through 39,000 bottles of wine.

339
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,360
 There were seven miles of tables, 1,200 liters of mayonnaise,

340
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,280
 1,500 camembert--

341
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
 Mayoronnaise.

342
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
 [LAUGHTER]

343
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,280
 [APPLAUSE]

344
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,260
 Yeah.

345
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,280
 Did someone just go, oh, dang.

346
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,280
 [LAUGHTER]

347
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
 Where'd you see that?

348
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
 [LAUGHTER]

349
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
 I'm plastic.

350
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
 [LAUGHTER]

351
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,520
 Someone has never seen this before.

352
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,480
 It was incredibly popular.

353
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,600
 So it was visited by more people than the population of France

354
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,520
 at the time.

355
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,080
 And it was only over about six months, I think,

356
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,480
 was visited by 50 million people.

357
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,880
 And the French population was 38 million at the time.

358
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,120
 So people were into it.

359
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,200
 Yeah, and apparently the technology of it

360
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,840
 was genuinely astounding.

361
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,980
 And I read about a guy, an artist, Italian artist,

362
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,760
 who went over for it called Giacomo Balla.

363
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,080
 And he was so impressed by all the technologies

364
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,880
 so that he named all his three daughters

365
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,520
 off the back of that wine expo.

366
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,160
 He named his daughters the Italian words for,

367
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,360
 but in English, light, electricity, and propeller.

368
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,360
 [LAUGHTER]

369
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,320
 And you were talking about there wanted

370
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,760
 to do something that was like the Eiffel Tower, but better.

371
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,000
 Well, they asked for suggestions, and a lot of people

372
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,760
 decided, well, maybe you should just do something

373
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,800
 with the Eiffel Tower.

374
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,080
 One of the suggestions was to turn the bottom half

375
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,320
 into a waterfall, and the top half

376
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,800
 into the shape of an enormous woman.

377
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
 What?

378
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
 No, it wouldn't look like she was wetting herself

379
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,760
 the whole time, but that was a real suggestion.

380
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,400
 And in the end, they had loads of different ideas

381
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,960
 of what they might do with the Eiffel Tower,

382
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,120
 but in the end, they just went for applying a fresh coat

383
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,320
 of paint to the spike.

384
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,480
 [LAUGHTER]

385
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,600
 On telescopes.

386
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,000
 Oh, yeah.

387
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,800
 So I was looking at other large telescopes.

388
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,720
 And there was another two large telescopes.

389
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,720
 Actually, the largest telescope in the world in 1935

390
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,560
 was reported about in the Nottingham Evening Post,

391
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,720
 I discovered in the British newspaper archive.

392
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,120
 And it turned out it was two large

393
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,800
 to go through railway tunnels.

394
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,720
 And so it was built in New York.

395
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,880
 And it had to get to California.

396
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,360
 But they had to take it by the Panama Canal.

397
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,200
 So that was rather than being a 2,900 mile journey.

398
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
 That was an 8,600 mile journey.

399
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,720
 Wow.

400
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,200
 Because they couldn't get it through any railway tunnels.

401
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,600
 They should have seen that coming.

402
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,280
 [LAUGHTER]

403
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
 Oh, candy.

404
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,240
 [LAUGHTER]

405
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,520
 Because they had an enormous telescope.

406
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,960
 Yeah.

407
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,880
 It was built to spot Martians, actually.

408
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,720
 Really?

409
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,120
 Yeah, it was built because they knew

410
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,680
 that there were indentations on Mars.

411
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,760
 And they wanted to establish whether or not

412
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,680
 they were made by Martians, were they Martian canals,

413
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,520
 or were they just naturally formed?

414
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,120
 What were they?

415
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,600
 And we're still not sure, but we're just not Martians.

416
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,720
 And there's the biggest telescope, which

417
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,160
 has just been built in China.

418
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,160
 And that's also, supposedly, for looking for aliens.

419
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,640
 Although the US Defense Department

420
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,160
 thinks it might be for something else.

421
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
 Right.

422
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,600
 But that's a radio one, not an optical one.

423
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,000
 So it's a 500-meter aperture spherical telescope.

424
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,560
 It's called Fast.

425
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,240
 And it is 500 meters across.

426
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,960
 That's where the name comes from.

427
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,160
 And I worked out that you would be able to get about 3 trillion

428
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,760
 bowls of complex in there.

429
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,160
 [LAUGHTER]

430
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,480
 And so that would be enough for complex for every person

431
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,560
 in the world to have a bowl every day for a year.

432
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,800
 And it still wouldn't run out.

433
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,400
 Wow.

434
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,800
 So is that what it's going to be for two hours a day?

435
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,640
 The really cool thing about it is you

436
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,280
 can probably see that it looks a bit

437
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,520
 different than normal telescopes.

438
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,760
 It's spherical, rather than a parabola.

439
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,320
 In fact, if anyone's listening at home,

440
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,680
 it is a spitting image of the thing James Bond

441
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
 classed a climb around in Golden Eye.

442
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,960
 Is that right?

443
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,480
 Yeah.

444
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,960
 OK.

445
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,440
 Looks like a very big conflict bowl.

446
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
 Yeah.

447
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,960
 But what they do is a parabola, normally, the data would come in,

448
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,320
 and it would all point to the focal point of the parabola.

449
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,200
 But they don't do that.

450
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,280
 So what they have is these six towers.

451
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,400
 And they have wires coming down on them.

452
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,160
 And there's a little robot in there.

453
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,080
 And you know if you watch a soccer game

454
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,880
 or an American football game or something,

455
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,080
 and you have the camera going around the top of this stadium,

456
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,920
 and it's able to take all the shots.

457
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,440
 Well, the robot is there.

458
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,160
 And they can move it around wherever they want.

459
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,560
 And they get it sort of to focus to wherever that robot is.

460
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
 Wow.

461
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
 That's really cool.

462
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,360
 I'm sorry, cool.

463
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,920
 Apparently, 10,000 people had to move house for the telescope

464
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,800
 to be installed, yeah?

465
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,300
 Yeah.

466
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,260
 Because they wanted to be closer to get a good look.

467
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,500
 And the people who stayed, the one condition

468
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,860
 is they have to have their mobile phone off.

469
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,820
 That's the only condition.

470
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,340
 Really?

471
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,340
 Yeah, because they're all interfere, so it will pick up.

472
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,140
 And they'd better like conflicts.

473
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,140
 [LAUGHTER]

474
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:35,020
 Have you heard of the James Webb Space Telescope?

475
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,940
 This is very cool.

476
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,860
 So Hubble is in space, because it's much better

477
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,940
 for looking at the stars, because there's

478
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,180
 no atmosphere in the way.

479
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,420
 And the next incarnation is going to be called

480
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,900
 the James Webb Space Telescope.

481
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,620
 It's going to be about 100 times better, apparently.

482
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,540
 Don't ask me in what metrics, but will we?

483
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,060
 They said that it's so powerful that when they turn it on,

484
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,140
 the heat will be able to detect heat coming from a bumblebee

485
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,260
 as far away as the moon.

486
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,260
 Wow.

487
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,420
 Well, there are not many bumblebees on the moon.

488
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,100
 Well, Buzz Aldrin left a few.

489
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,100
 She said so.

490
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,340
 [LAUGHTER]

491
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,380
 We were actually getting a robot to put a telescope

492
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,980
 on the far side of the moon.

493
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,540
 There actually is telescopes on the moon at the moment.

494
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,580
 China has telescopes on some of their small rovers,

495
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,540
 and they've been looking out into the universe as well.

496
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,660
 But we only found this out a few years after they'd

497
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,260
 been doing it.

498
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,580
 So they had secret telescopes on the moon.

499
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,420
 Wow.

500
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,420
 Yeah, pretty cool.

501
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,620
 One more big telescope?

502
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,580
 Yeah, we need to move on and start.

503
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,660
 OK.

504
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,540
 Havilius.

505
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,540
 He was a guy who made a telescope, and it was really big.

506
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,980
 It was 150 feet long.

507
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,260
 And it was so long that he couldn't make a tube to fit it in.

508
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,220
 Because a metal tube would be too heavy,

509
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,660
 and a paper tube would just fall apart.

510
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,620
 And so he put it in like a trough.

511
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,780
 It was like a trough where all the lenses went in.

512
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,380
 And he had to have a team of men with ropes and pulleys.

513
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,700
 And they were just there to kind of keep it steady.

514
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,780
 Because even the tiniest breeze would just

515
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,220
 rip the whole thing apart.

516
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,500
 Yeah, so it didn't really work, did it?

517
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,180
 It did not.

518
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,860
 When was that?

519
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,460
 It's amazing.

520
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,500
 Renaissance is it, nor is it after that.

521
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,140
 Well, it must be before the 18th century.

522
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,420
 Because one of the other things that Havilius invented

523
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,900
 were side-looking opera glasses.

524
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,340
 So you could have these glasses where I could be--

525
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,380
 look like I'm looking over here, but actually I'm looking at Andy.

526
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,620
 And they were called polymer scopes.

527
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,020
 Why, if you've gone to see the opera?

528
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,940
 What's wrong with my face, then?

529
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,700
 Well, he called them polymer scopes

530
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,460
 after the Greek for war, because he thought

531
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,100
 you'd be able to use it in military positions.

532
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,700
 Good news.

533
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,180
 Their entire army is facing 90 degrees away.

534
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,660
 They will never see us coming.

535
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:51,100
 Wait, yeah, wouldn't you see the person next to you?

536
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,860
 And they're like, there's a traitor in this area.

537
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,540
 They were never really used in the military.

538
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,340
 But the reason I know that he's pre-18th century

539
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,300
 is they were used in the 18th century

540
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,140
 for looking sideways at young women at bowls.

541
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,260
 Yeah.

542
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,540
 But it's nice, Andy, that you didn't automatically assume

543
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,460
 that was what they were used for.

544
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,300
 It shows you're a wholesome person.

545
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,380
 That's immediately what I think it is for.

546
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,060
 Don't get invited to many bowls anymore.

547
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,220
 I think we have one on the TV show.

548
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,340
 We borrowed one from the Museum of Optical Instruments

549
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:23,820
 or something.

550
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,740
 Yeah, they're very cool.

551
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,300
 I've got one last thing, which is that the planet Neptune,

552
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,700
 when it was discovered, it was discovered within the hour

553
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,780
 of astronomers starting to look for it.

554
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,460
 So literally, they went, I reckon it's about there.

555
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,260
 Oh, yeah, there it is.

556
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,740
 [LAUGHTER]

557
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,420
 OK, it's time for our next fact.

558
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,060
 And that is Anichezinski.

559
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,060
 My fact is that the first gentleman's club in America

560
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,500
 was formed for the purpose of eating turtle soup.

561
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,460
 So this is the Hoboken Turtle Club.

562
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,380
 Actually, I haven't looked up to how to pronounce that.

563
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,220
 Hoboken Turtle Club.

564
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,420
 There we go.

565
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,540
 [LAUGHTER]

566
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,900
 I just looked it up in my mind.

567
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,820
 [LAUGHTER]

568
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,100
 This was the brainchild of a guy called John Stevens.

569
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,180
 And he lived in New Jersey.

570
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,820
 And he kept chickens.

571
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,580
 And he was plagued by turtles.

572
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,220
 And he discovered that these big turtles

573
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,900
 were jumping out of the river and grabbing his chickens

574
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,780
 and killing them.

575
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,020
 So he declared that he would have vengeance on all the turtles.

576
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,540
 Wow.

577
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,460
 And actually, a lot of sources say it

578
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,020
 was Alexander Hamilton's idea--

579
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,540
 Hamilton of hit Broadway musical fame--

580
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,620
 to make this turtle club.

581
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,300
 So Hamilton said to Stevens, that you

582
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,340
 should make a turtle factory on your New Jersey farm

583
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,580
 and kill the turtles, and we should eat them.

584
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,940
 And so they decided to do that.

585
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,340
 They created this club, and they killed turtles.

586
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,180
 They ate them.

587
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,420
 And a bunch of important people joined.

588
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,540
 So Jefferson, Franklin, Burr, Hamilton, Washington.

589
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,900
 They were all members of the Hoboken Turtle Club.

590
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,420
 They hung out.

591
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,260
 They ate turtles soup.

592
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,660
 They had the best time.

593
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,580
 And that was the first members club.

594
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,980
 So there's a bit of detail.

595
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,340
 I just want to pick you up on quickly.

596
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,180
 So these turtles were eating his chickens, right?

597
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,060
 So OK, I've got two things.

598
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,580
 One, turtles incredibly slow, as far as I know.

599
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,260
 Two, I'm pretty sure that chickens are incredibly fast.

600
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,260
 In fact, fast to the point that did anyone see creed?

601
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,580
 Like Rocky, Sylvester Sloan gets him to try and catch chickens.

602
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,780
 That's part of the training for a lot of people.

603
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,180
 So they're really quick.

604
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,860
 So what the fuck?

605
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,900
 You're chicken.

606
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,420
 Yeah.

607
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,420
 What kind of superspeeds are you lost?

608
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,620
 You're citing the seventh Rocky film.

609
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:42,620
 In the eighth Rocky film, that actually

610
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,860
 going to have been beaten by a turtle.

611
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,180
 It's a real insane.

612
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,700
 Well, they can snap out with their jaws incredibly fast.

613
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,820
 Turtles can.

614
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,820
 Right.

615
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,180
 Once they get close to you, you lay there there.

616
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,940
 OK, right.

617
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,940
 So if you don't seem sneak up on you, then you are dead meat.

618
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,580
 This is my theory, so don't quote me on it.

619
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,220
 But it might have been a lie, because the way that he found out

620
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,140
 was that one of his servant boys, he sent down to the river

621
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,860
 to find out why his chickens kept disappearing.

622
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,340
 And the servant boy came back and said,

623
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,860
 look, I was lying by the river side reading my book,

624
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,500
 apparently romance fiction, weirdly.

625
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,140
 Reading my book and suddenly a turtle let down the river

626
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,980
 and grabbed a chicken.

627
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,980
 So maybe the servant boy was just stealing all of his chickens

628
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,420
 and then who'd have blamed it on?

629
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,580
 Let out of the relics as well, yeah.

630
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,500
 Do you know what these things are called?

631
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,340
 These parties were called turtle frolics.

632
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,340
 That's what you'd have.

633
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,900
 You'd have a turtle frolic come on over.

634
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,900
 But what's really open about that is if you were a turtle

635
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,580
 and someone said, do you want to come to a turtle frolic,

636
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,940
 keep saying yes, because you'd assume you're wrong thing.

637
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,540
 Do you know mock turtle soup?

638
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,980
 So turtle soup was hugely popular.

639
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,580
 And in fact, the only reason it's become far less popular

640
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,340
 in America is because they have eaten all the turtles

641
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,340
 in loads of teeth, and they're really endangered now.

642
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,980
 So in the 19th century, you had mock turtle soup,

643
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,180
 which is made with a calf's head, lovely.

644
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,540
 This is Campbell's famously had mock turtle soup.

645
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,300
 So you're like it's unusual flavor.

646
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,740
 Sometimes I found a book from 1821 with a load of recipes in,

647
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,380
 and it said that the fetus of the cow

648
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,220
 is regularly sold to pastry cooks

649
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,700
 for the purpose of making mock turtle soup, lovely.

650
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,260
 Nixon banned soup from White House, from America.

651
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,620
 From White House state dinners, yeah.

652
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,660
 So this was according to Harry Bob Hadelman,

653
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,580
 who was his, he was the cheapest staff for Nixon.

654
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,620
 And famously was the main perpetrator of Watergate.

655
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,300
 Of Watergate, yeah, he did gel time.

656
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,660
 And he said that what happened was Nixon one day said,

657
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,380
 I don't want any soup at any of our dinners, OK?

658
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,380
 And he said, well, it's a perfect thing.

659
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,620
 He says, no one likes soup.

660
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,420
 No one's into soup.

661
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,420
 Let's get it banned.

662
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,020
 And then he spoke to someone who had dinner

663
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,180
 with Nixon the night before.

664
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,980
 And Nixon was famously clumsy.

665
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,340
 And apparently they were having soup.

666
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,900
 And he got it over his shirt.

667
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,860
 And he thought, this is unacceptable.

668
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,420
 And so he banned soup.

669
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,260
 So no soup was ever served.

670
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,180
 Did he say, wait a minute, there's a bug in my soup.

671
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,740
 Because of the Watergate scandal.

672
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,940
 Even I didn't like that.

673
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,060
 President Lincoln's last ever meal was mock total soup.

674
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,580
 Was it?

675
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,820
 Yeah, along with like six other dishes.

676
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,460
 But it was a starter, I think.

677
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,260
 Well, they more lax on the last meal thing in those days.

678
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,220
 Well, I don't think he knew he was going to die.

679
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,100
 Yeah, I guess he was on death row, actually, I suppose.

680
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,220
 This feels like a last meal.

681
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,060
 I don't think I should go out tonight.

682
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,580
 They actually, the turtle club meetings,

683
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,460
 used to become eating competitions.

684
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,820
 They morphed into that.

685
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,140
 Yeah, so the famous soup maker for the turtle club meetings

686
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,620
 in the second half of the 19th century

687
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,500
 was a guy called John Tarbell.

688
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,100
 And he used to arrive two days before the club would have

689
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,020
 its meeting.

690
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,060
 And a newspaper report from the time he said,

691
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,620
 he'd arrive with turtles, flippers tied,

692
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,660
 and eyes are bulged with apprehension.

693
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,140
 And two days later, they'd be in a soup.

694
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,580
 So it was justified apprehension.

695
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,740
 And if you could eat more than three plates,

696
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,020
 then you automatically entered the eating competition.

697
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,180
 And then I think the winner in 1894

698
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,620
 would eat in seven main courses.

699
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,860
 And you got presented with a vegetable bouquet at the end of it.

700
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,140
 It's just classic boys club stuff.

701
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,900
 We need to move on to the next final fan.

702
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,660
 So just maybe one or two little kind of other clubs.

703
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,220
 Yes, right.

704
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,340
 Gentleman's clubs.

705
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,540
 There was a 13 club, which was an anti-superstition club.

706
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,980
 They wanted to say, OK, look, this idea of 13 being bad luck

707
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,460
 is just ridiculous.

708
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,420
 So let's go for dinner with 13 of us.

709
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,780
 And let's have 13 of this and 13 of that.

710
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,100
 And let's walk under some ladders and have some black hats,

711
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,580
 and all that kind of stuff.

712
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,060
 But at the first meeting, only 12 people turned up.

713
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,540
 [LAUGHTER]

714
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,060
 So they--

715
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:02,420
 The 13th had been decapitated by a dropped mirror.

716
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,140
 Well, they drafted it a waiter to make up the numbers.

717
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,980
 And unfortunately, the waiter was extremely superstitious.

718
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,300
 So he spent the whole time howling and trembling like a leader.

719
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,980
 I'm going to move this on to our final flag.

720
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,620
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

721
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,900
 And that is my fact.

722
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,900
 My fact is that when evil can evils start in the 1977 film

723
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,300
 "Viva Can Evil," he used a stunt double.

724
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,580
 [LAUGHTER]

725
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,420
 How cool is that?

726
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,900
 Greatest supposed daredevil in the world using a stunt double.

727
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,420
 Was it for insurance or something like that?

728
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,140
 It was, yes.

729
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,700
 So they booked him, and he plays himself in the movie.

730
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,220
 And the idea was that he would make all these leaps.

731
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,540
 And he was at one of the shows where they were going to test out.

732
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,820
 And they did have a stunt double already.

733
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,540
 But he did a wheelie just to the crowd, and he fell off.

734
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,380
 And the insurance people came in and said, OK, that's what you're done.

735
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,180
 And he couldn't do anything else for the movie.

736
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,260
 He fell off during a wheelie.

737
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,260
 He was just-- he was crap, wasn't he?

738
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,540
 He was the worst.

739
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,340
 He was the worst.

740
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,420
 He just fell over all the time.

741
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,300
 That's all he did.

742
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,540
 All of his actual claims to fame are the mistakes that he made.

743
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,260
 So there was a huge thing that put him on the map

744
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,540
 was when he failed to leap over the fountains at Caesar's Palace

745
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,540
 in Las Vegas.

746
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,180
 So he went over, and he clipped right at the end of the ramp,

747
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,580
 and he went right off.

748
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,380
 And so the jump was 150 feet.

749
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,540
 That's how far he was jumping.

750
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,100
 When he flew off the bike, he went 165 feet.

751
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,580
 He cleared the jump in a fall by 15 feet.

752
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,540
 And that's what put him on the map.

753
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,620
 But then the bike hit him.

754
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,780
 It was really-- it was horrible.

755
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,740
 But do you know why he was there in the first place in Las Vegas?

756
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,240
 No.

757
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,980
 He was there to see a boxer whose name was Dick Tiger.

758
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,460
 [LAUGHTER]

759
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,700
 Why isn't this stuff on the national curriculum, guys?

760
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,980
 I read a few obituries of even cannibal.

761
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,260
 And one of the sentences was that he

762
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,980
 went into semi-retirement after a failed attempt

763
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,380
 to jump a pool full of sharks in Chicago in 1976.

764
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,140
 He didn't fall in.

765
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,940
 He didn't fall in.

766
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,180
 He came off the ramp again.

767
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,980
 He had a real problem with ramps, with ramps.

768
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,740
 But he's a fascinating character,

769
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,660
 because he was one of those guys who

770
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,980
 became one of the most famous people in America in his time,

771
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,540
 then disappeared for a very long time.

772
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,460
 Then the revival of nostalgia came about.

773
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,140
 And he came back big in the '90s again.

774
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,820
 He did a revival tour.

775
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,780
 Revival cannibal.

776
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,140
 Because that rhymes with his name.

777
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,140
 [LAUGHTER]

778
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,380
 He's trying to see the way I have to explain.

779
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,420
 [LAUGHTER]

780
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,100
 I would say far too many, so.

781
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,020
 [LAUGHTER]

782
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,460
 No, but so he was a huge character.

783
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,180
 And he led his life like he was the most famous man in the world.

784
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,940
 He bought private jets.

785
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,100
 He had countless motorbikes.

786
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,100
 He used to, because he'd injured himself so much,

787
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,900
 he used to walk around with a cane.

788
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,500
 And the cane was really cool.

789
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,940
 It could screw off at the top.

790
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,660
 And he had vials of whiskey inside, six vials of whiskey.

791
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,500
 So he could have shots wherever he was going.

792
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,940
 Yeah, he got incredibly drunk before his last famous jump,

793
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,020
 which was actually in the UK.

794
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,780
 He was jumping over 13 buses.

795
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,780
 Yeah.

796
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,220
 UK, he got incredibly drunk the night before with this guy,

797
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,740
 Frank Gifford, who was the broadcaster, who was going to show it.

798
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,180
 And he woke up the next day, and he went incredibly hung over

799
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,820
 to look at what he had to jump.

800
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,140
 And he said, I can't do this.

801
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,220
 This is impossible.

802
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,020
 It's going to fail.

803
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,100
 And so Frank Gifford said, OK, well, don't do it.

804
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,700
 And he said, well, I have to do it.

805
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,820
 [LAUGHTER]

806
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,860
 So, but it's just going to fail.

807
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,820
 And so it did indeed fail.

808
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,540
 And he crashed, and he ended up smashing into this wall.

809
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,460
 And Frank Gifford said he landed almost at his feet.

810
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,820
 And he was spewing blood from his mouth.

811
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,660
 And his bones were sticking out of his hand.

812
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,420
 And so Frank bent down to his new friend

813
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,060
 to see if he was still alive.

814
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,260
 And he noticed that he was trying to say something.

815
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,660
 And so he listened to him thinking,

816
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,180
 these could be his last words.

817
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,860
 And he said, Frank, get that broad out of my room.

818
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,180
 Just get that lady out of my room.

819
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:59,340
 I just want to be sent back there on my own now.

820
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,860
 Oh, my God.

821
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,340
 When he was filming Viva Keneval, because he didn't

822
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,100
 have to do the stunts, he just every night

823
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,620
 went off to the bars of LA.

824
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,020
 And he frequented most of his favorite bar.

825
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,500
 It's called Filthy McNasty.

826
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,820
 [LAUGHTER]

827
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,700
 That was an actual play, very famous place, very famous bar.

828
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,620
 And it shut down.

829
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,460
 And it got--

830
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,780
 Yeah, hygiene regulation.

831
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,780
 [LAUGHTER]

832
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,820
 No, but when he used to go there,

833
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,660
 if he got completely drunk, what the owners of the place

834
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,540
 would do is they would go outside and they had a huge sign.

835
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,900
 And they'd changed the words from whatever

836
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,300
 they had to, now, drunk inside, evil Keneval.

837
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,700
 So he went to prison, beating up his PR with a baseball bat.

838
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,340
 And I read one account that said that he did this,

839
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,980
 even though both his arms were in plaster at the time.

840
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:52,740
 He also coined his name in prison, didn't he?

841
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,100
 So he obviously wasn't called evil Keneval.

842
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,620
 But this is when he went to prison before he became famous.

843
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,620
 And he did a lot of rubberies, he committed a lot of crimes,

844
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,180
 he fell in with the wrong crowds.

845
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,100
 And his cellmate in prison was called Awful Keneval.

846
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,580
 [LAUGHTER]

847
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,340
 He was called William Keneval.

848
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,060
 But people called him Awful Keneval.

849
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,100
 Who are the guards called him Awful Keneval?

850
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,180
 Well, it's exactly that.

851
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:22,500
 Yeah, they were saying it's a fun pair of names

852
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,180
 to have if we name him evil Keneval.

853
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,220
 That's so cool.

854
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,500
 And actually, it was evil with an eye originally,

855
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,220
 but I think he thought it would look too mean.

856
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,020
 I looked into Kenoffal, and he looks like he was a murderer.

857
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,300
 He escaped prison three times.

858
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,620
 And eventually, this was in Montana because he was from Montana.

859
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,740
 And they kicked him out of Montana and said,

860
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,540
 as long as you go to California, we won't chase you anymore.

861
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,060
 And so they sent him off to California,

862
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,100
 and he never came back.

863
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,260
 That's the last one.

864
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,300
 Evil Keneval's son is now also a dead devil.

865
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,180
 He has recreated some of the jumps that Evil Keneval

866
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,300
 didn't make, and I went to his website.

867
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,380
 And it says, "Want Captain Keneval to jump something bad

868
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,660
 as for your live event?"

869
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,620
 So he can get into jump over anything you want?

870
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,020
 I didn't actually ask for a quote.

871
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,900
 I should have done.

872
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,220
 We should get him to jump over our podcast while we're doing it.

873
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,580
 Just book him just to--

874
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,900
 But it won't make any sense in a future episode.

875
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,180
 I should have booked him for this one.

876
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,740
 So some things on stuntmen generally.

877
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,820
 So the Guinness World Record holder for most stunts

878
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,860
 in a movie, in a movie career as well, is Jackie Chan.

879
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,700
 He holds the Guinness World Record for that.

880
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,660
 He's actually got two Guinness World Records.

881
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,060
 So one is for the most stunts in a movie career

882
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,420
 of a living person.

883
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,340
 And the second one is that he has the most credits

884
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,340
 in a single film.

885
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,540
 15.

886
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,780
 It's got 15 credits.

887
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,580
 And that's what he's got that second one for.

888
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,620
 It's called a Chinese zodiac.

889
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,260
 And his credits include, obviously, actor, writer,

890
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,820
 director, producer, exact producer.

891
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,140
 Gaffer stunt double.

892
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,620
 So I looked into it because I thought, well, that doesn't count,

893
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,980
 if you're just doing your own stunts.

894
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,060
 It's not his stunts.

895
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,220
 He does the other character stunts.

896
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,460
 Is it a fight suit?

897
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,180
 Yeah, he's punching in stunts.

898
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,140
 He's punching in stunts.

899
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,660
 Exactly.

900
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,780
 Why are you hitting yourself, Jackie?

901
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,300
 And lastly, probably my favorite one on that list

902
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,780
 of his credits, catering coordinator.

903
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,540
 And you can see photos where he's behind, like I know.

904
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,020
 Lasagna, vegetarian way.

905
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,500
 That's so cool.

906
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,820
 He's an amazing character, Jackie Chan.

907
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,820
 I said on the podcast ages ago, and he

908
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,180
 said this on the view in America that he's not allowed

909
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,940
 to get into fights in America on the street

910
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,500
 because his hands are illegal weapons.

911
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,580
 I would argue no one's allowed

912
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,020
 to get into fights on the streets of America.

913
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,500
 And so they say that if--

914
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,860
 OK, a normal fight, if you were having a fight on the street,

915
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,180
 a punch is a punch.

916
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,860
 A punch from Jackie Chan in the eyes of the law,

917
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:03,140
 according to Jackie Chan, is firing a gun.

918
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,620
 What if he punches himself?

919
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,140
 And I can't.

920
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,420
 Suicide, suicide, suicide.

921
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,780
 And also, he claims that his mother was pregnant with him

922
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,260
 for 12 months.

923
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,780
 I've got a fact about one of your heroes

924
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,460
 who makes incredibly dubious claims.

925
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:17,960
 Yeah.

926
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,020
 It's Brian Blessed.

927
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,740
 This is from Brian Blessed's autobiography.

928
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,300
 He says that when he was doing the show,

929
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,820
 Zed Cars, back in the '60s, '70s, '70s.

930
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,380
 He couldn't drive, so he had a stuntman under his seat,

931
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,300
 working all the pedals, and the gears.

932
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,500
 And the BBC then eventually paid for driving lessons

933
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,020
 after Blessed became overexcited by his performance

934
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,700
 and kicked his stuntman in the bollocks.

935
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,460
 We're going to have to wrap up in literally a couple

936
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,900
 of minutes because we're going to shut the building.

937
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,020
 So I'm just very quickly.

938
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,540
 This is a guy called Ron Cunningham, who was the--

939
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,180
 I think the oldest stuntman ever working.

940
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,540
 He did his final performance in Brighton at the age of 90

941
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,580
 as a stuntman.

942
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,580
 And this is the description of it.

943
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,100
 He, surrounded by a bevy of Brazilian beauties,

944
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,540
 crushed broken bottles with his bare feet,

945
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,780
 set himself a light with lighter fuel,

946
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,900
 stabbed himself several times in the chest with a bendy knife,

947
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,700
 smashed a big glass into his neck with a hammer,

948
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,940
 and rounded things off by telling his infamous chicken joke.

949
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,420
 [LAUGHTER]

950
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,220
 What a guy!

952
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,660
 OK, that's it.
