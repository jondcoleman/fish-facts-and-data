WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800
 Hi guys, little announcement before the show. We are doing another live show in London.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.400
 It's up the creek in Greenwich where we did a show before and we had a really great time,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.400
 so we decided to beg them to let us back. The show is going to be on the 7th of December

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.600
 and it's going to be kind of different this time. First of all, it's going to be filmed

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.000
 for reasons we don't really understand. So, you know, bring your best face and second of all,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.400
 it's going to be a two-parter. So the first part is going to be us doing the podcast

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.800
 within the second part. It's going to be same format as you might have heard we did once before,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.600
 where you guys bring your own facts, you guys in the audience and we talk about them and it's really,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.000
 really fun. So you should all come, go to qi.com/fishevents to get tickets.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.200
 Also, today's episode features a special guest. An Australian scientist called Dr. Carl Krzyszelnetski.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.000
 Now, this guy is a massive hero of mine. He was Mr. QI in Australia. If you're Australian,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.200
 you definitely know who he is. If you're not Australian and you haven't heard of him, please check him out.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.200
 He's got a new book coming out. It's called Short Back and Science. He's got amazing book titles.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.200
 That should be out in Australia now. You can probably order it online. And apologies for the slight

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.400
 bad audio quality of this. We had a buzz in the room from an air conditioning unit and it was causing

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.200
 all sorts of disruptions. But it's a good show. He's amazing. Have a listen. Bies book. Thanks so much. On with the show.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:43.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you from the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Wardolph Astoria Hotel in Central London. My name is Dan Shriver. I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, Alex Bell and our

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 special guest, Australian scientist author of great named books like House of Carls, Game of Knowns, 50 Shades of Grey Matter.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 It's Dr. Carl Krushal Nitski. Very good pronunciation. Thank you. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Dr. Carl.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Yes, my favorite fact is two people in Sydney every week get bitten by ticks and shortly after become allergic to meat for the rest of their lives.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Now, I'm hyping it up a little bit. They're only allergic to non-primate mammals. But if they have beef, for example, several months after the event, they can then become

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 allergic to meat for the rest of their life and go into the full anaphylactic reaction. None of these sort of, like, I have the vapors. I must lie down. But the full, I can't breathe. My face is swelling. If you don't not give me a

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 adrenaline, I will die. Anna, as in wrong and relax us to guard. So your body is going into a wrongly triggered immune reaction.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 I really like that a lot of them can still eat chicken and fish, just like most semi-commissive vegetarians.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 No, I'm allergic to all me. Well, I mean, I'm not allergic to fish. And it's the worst punishment for an Australian emotional. Not being able to have a barbecue.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Oh, yeah. So what happens is that there's a bandicoot and it's carrying around in its blood, in its body, in its meat, a chemical called alpha-gal.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 So the alpha-gal goes, this chemical alpha-gal that goes, goes from the bandicoot into the tick and then into you. We humans do not have it. And here's the weird thing about it.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 It's the first known allergen that is the sugar. And the result of that is that two people a week in Sydney will start going into a bit of regular meat and then suddenly start trying to drop dead.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 Wow. That's right. Has this been going on for a long time and we've just found out? Or it's not like a new species of super tick?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Well, the tick is only the vector of the carrier. Yes. Yes. But maybe the tick is now evolving to be able to carry a larger amount.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Because I was always wrong about evolution. I went to the Glavicus Islands last month. So I read the book "The Beak of the Finch." It's amazing. It blew my mind.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 It's about evolution. Evolution happens really quickly. So when you look at it in a fossil record, over hundreds of thousands of millions of years, you're seeing the beginning point and the end point.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 And you don't see it in between, but jumps up and down violently. So yes, your point about the tick evolving could in fact be true.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 So on another thing on parasites and ticks and things like that, tortoises find it very hard to get rid of ticks because of their necks and because of the way they can't stretch around and their shells.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 So North American wood tortoises, they just walk into ants nests and they just sit in the middle of the ants nest and obviously the ants swarm all over them and they eat all the parasites.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 And eventually the tortoise thinks right and clean enough and walks out the other side. Wow. That's amazing. Yeah.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Symbiotic relationships. I read about hunting the way that ticks hunt, which is really nice. The article I read said that they are patient hunters and the idea is that what they do is they wait in a spot where they see where something is coming along.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 They wait for the thing to come up to it and then they just step onto it. So that's their hunting. There's no they can't leap. They don't chase anything down. They just wait.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 They just wait. Exactly. Yeah. They patiently wait and just step on. They climb up a blade of grass and they cling on with the second and third pairs of legs and their first pair of legs. Actually they've got four pairs of legs haven't they because they're magnets.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 But their first pair of legs they just hold out in front of them waiting for something to get near enough for them to hang onto. It's called questing.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 That's a special name for it. That's very good. Yeah. Just on the subject of allergies, odd allergy because I you know that's a that's an amazing thing to get you can't eat me anymore.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 I read a story about a court in France has given 500 pound a month disability allowance, so equivalent 500 pounds a month to a lady who claimed and they've recognized this as an allergy that she's allergic to Wi-Fi.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 So she said she was allergic to Wi-Fi. Hyper sensitivity. Ruben is a guy every five years he comes out with something and he says mate you're lying. Right. Ruben is a guy who they guess these people and he they look up electro magnetic hypersensitivity syndrome on a good friend Wikipedia.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Yeah. Ruben 2010 2005 and there's one coming up in 2015 and he's a guy who gets him in a room and then in a double blind says how do you feel the symptoms now?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 At least you're on and off and they always fail. Oh, but you should get over to there. Yeah, I can't believe they gave that to her.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 You know, you can be allergic to egg yolks and not egg whites. Different chemicals again proteins. That's how specific allergies can get.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 And you can train yourself out of allergies in some cases and some cases you can't and you can then pick up allergies. The human immune system is wonderfully fiendish.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 So on the training yourself out of allergies thing I read that you can train yourself out of for example a peanut allergy and they tried it with a group of children by slowly exposing them to first very, very small amounts of peanut and then gradually increasing it.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 The only thing is if you then can have say 5 or 10 peanuts and experience no effects if you then think oh well that's fine and you stop eating them then the tolerance goes away.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 So you have to purposely you have to keep eating peanuts the thing you were allergic to in order to keep yourself not allergic to.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 Wow. Yeah. Isn't that straight? Yeah, that's amazing.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Wait, so if you're allergic to peanuts what are you actually allergic to because peanut is sound really dumb here but it's not a nut is it? It's a legume.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 Yeah, so it's poorly understood exactly what's going on but the current theory relates to the processing method which involves high temperatures.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 Okay, so if you get nicotine which is sort of drifting off of the side thing here the secret nicotine of itself has various properties not too good not too bad.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 Mixed but when you burn it you create so many different chemicals you've heard of that nasty stuff the dioxins if you get a backyard compost pile and just some leaves and and burn it you will create some dioxins because you'll have a range of oxygen availability and temperatures that you will create some nasty chemicals.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 So burning anything creates bad stuff pollution is bad in that sense and so in China where they do it the old way no such thing is peanut allergies.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Really don't exist. So there's something going on still trying to find out but we'll find out soon.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Wow. We need to move on to our next fact. Can I can I just check obviously I seem to be a magnet for dubious facts so I just want to check one last allergy.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 There was a girl called Grace Morley so she wasn't allergic to apples she wasn't allergic to birch trees but if she ate an apple near a birch tree she had an allergy.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 Yeah you can have pre-triggering look up pre-triggering in the magazines and Google search look up the word review.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 Okay review and you will find that could possibly be my wife is a GP and she had a patient who was allergic to water.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Oh yes I read about that because when you allergic to your own sweat and so it's it's not.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 Yeah well the role you have to do is be around long enough to love another person very much in a special way have babies and then you can die as from an evolutionary point of view.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Actually being alive and comfortable doesn't come into it.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 So what is this allergy? They have brushes on their skin if they wash with water.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 It's the ions in the water not purified water does something to your skin so if you have to purify all the water that you drink and then pretty much any water that you come into contact with is not including your tears in your sweat bring up like rashes on your skin and it's really uncomfortable.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 And there's another allergy which is with the some people some women are allergic to some of the chemicals in sperm semen.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 Yes imagine imagine imagine if you were allergic to both sex and water you can get clean you couldn't get dirty.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 But you can cross with you.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Time for our second fact and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 My fact is that the Millennium Bug is going to hit in 2038.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 That's my fact and I'm sticking to it. Explain yourself.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Okay so a lot of computers these days run on 32-bit processors.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 The processor is the central calculating bit basically and they can handle two to the power of 32 different values and one of the ways they count value is seconds.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 For some reason all computers count from the first of January 1970. Notice the epoch.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 So they can store about two billion positive values two billion 147 billion 483,647 positive values or seconds in this.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 And that number of seconds after the first of January 1970 it's 314 in the morning and seven seconds on the 19th of March 2038.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 And some computers at that point will go a little bit haywire and not be able to keep counting the seconds upwards.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Wow. Now it's not going to be catastrophic.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 I'm already panicking. There's seven Millennium bugs.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 Well there's good news in one sense because a lot of I mean most new computers these days run on 64-bit processors and those are capable of going for another 292 billion years.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 I don't trust them either. We should be more prepared.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 So it's just there are but there will be some 32-bit systems in things like big transport systems, big embedded computers that are really hard to get out or update.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 So some of those will have a problem.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Right.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 Yeah. So that is the proper Millennium bug.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Yeah well there be in PLCs, programmable logic controllers. PLCs all over the world controlling how much water goes into a hotel.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 The size of the dollop of cream on your little biscuit.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 The Australian biscuit called an iced vova. I don't know if you have such.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 I think they might be similar similar. PLCs have been designed without security and providing they were only leave them there.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 And they're the bugs that are going to cause the problem further down the line because you'll have the machines have moved up from 32-bit to 64.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 And people will be aware of it because with the Millennium bug the Y2K as opposed to the Y2K38 basically the world spent about $400 billion fixing make sure it didn't go bad.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 And that was things like poker machines or slot machines in Delaware and work and your radiation counters in Japan and work and buses didn't work in Hobart.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 And according to my mates in the IT industry they all sweated blood for months and years beforehand getting ready for it because it wasn't so they just did something the night before.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 They spent months and months fixing things up so it wouldn't happen. This one is going to be nasty. We've come across maybe even the variation of it in the Boeing 787.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Oh yes. Oh my God. That was terrifying when that came up in the news.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 What was this that can I that they recently issued a statement saying we it may be the case that all of our engines will shut down if you leave them on for more than 248 days because that number of seconds the computer can't count more of it.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 And it will spontaneously shut down into some sort of failsafe mode even potentially if they're up in the air.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 And number one. Did they always turn it off when responsible for the whole desert leaving an engine on for 248 days.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Don't they turn it off when they park the clock is still running in the background because the on off switch is no longer an on off switch.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 It's just pretend to be a sleep while the owner is there but keep on reporting their very thoughts to the mothership you have no privacy.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And in fact it turns out that 248 days when you count it in one hundredths of a second is 10 to the 32 one hundredths of a second.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 But they didn't announce that people were that out people think well there must be a reason that many days.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 And also it was involved with an Aryan rocket doing bad things as well.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Because that had 16 bit architecture and that only takes you up to 32,000 or so somethings and the Aryan fire which was so much better than the Aryan 4.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 It had too much the phrase I used was sideways velocity.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 Now I guess they must be using it in some incredibly small unit like micro meters per hour or something.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 But once it gets over 32,000 you've used up the clock on your maximum number like just a bit of a backup for the audience.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 Numbers are infinite. You never gonna run out.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 So what's this thing about running out of numbers but the trouble is that computers have limited storage.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Think about the odometer on your car.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 It rolls up to 99,000 kilometers or miles and then goes back to zero again.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 So that's the whole problem that your clock is suddenly wrong and then you get mismatches.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 So the Aryan 5 had a problem with that as well.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 This is also like Donkey Kong where if you get such a high score, you can't handle it.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 It goes to the kill screen.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 Really?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 That's how much does that work?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 That's such a high score.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 No, that's what you see.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 There's an incredible Donkey.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Donkey Mentry.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 A Donkey Mentry.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 A Donkey Mentry.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 A Donkey Mentry called King of Kong.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 Highly recommend watching it and that's it.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 You get to the kill screen. It's known as the numbers can't handle it and the whole computer sort of explodes within.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 Well, now that sci-guy, the Korean guy, it was his style of Daniel Stone.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 So he nearly killed the YouTube counter because two to the 32 divided by a half takes you up to 2.14 billion views.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 And I saw that they were getting close to the 2.14 billion views out of a world population of only seven.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 So they then went to 64 billion, which is 292 billion.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 Space Invaders is another game that is the way it is because of a bug.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 So you know the point of Space Invaders is that you've got to shoot down all the little ships that are coming down to get you.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 And as you shoot more and more down, they come down faster and there's a difficulty curve.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 That wasn't supposed to be the case when they built it.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 It was just that when you played the game, the machines that it was running on weren't fast enough powerful enough.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 They weren't powerful enough to run the program at full speed.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 So the program was actually running quite slowly at the beginning.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 The more ships you shot down, the less data there was to process.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 So the faster it was able to run.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 And when the guy who made the game ran it, he realized that was actually a really great difficulty curve to play the game on.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 So a couple of things about the Millennium Bug, which I thought you might like to know.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 In February 1999, hundreds of people made panicked phone calls to Action 2000, which was the British body for dealing with the Millennium Bug.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 After Richard Maidley, TV host, on this morning, gave people a look at his Millennium cupboard, which was full of tin food and candles.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 And he recommended that people stockpile 10 weeks worth of food for after the Millennium.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Oh my god.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 I think hundreds of calls just because Richard Maidley had done this.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 And the World Health Organization said that nuclear reactors might be at risk.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Well, there's a lot of clocks in them.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 They've all got clocks, I know.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 And we will never know how much was because a lot of money was spent fixing the problem.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 And how much was hype?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 I mean, there was definitely hype.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 And I think a lot of people made a stack of money selling pieces.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 Yeah.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 I know a lot of IT people who were honest.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 And they said they worked their little butts off.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 Right, yeah.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 Right.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 We should move on to our next fact.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 One very, very quick last thing.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 Go for it.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 On the Millennium Bug.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 This was a Millennium Style Bug.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 So last year, 2014, the US Army sent 14,000 conscription letters out.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 All to men who had been born in the 1800s.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 And they sent it to their descendants.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 So they say your great-grandfather must report for military service on pain of a fine or imprisonment, if he doesn't.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 There you go.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 The youngest of them would have been 117 years old.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 Okay, time for fact number three.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 And that is Alex.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 My fact this week is that Buckminster Fuller's complete diaries take up over 80 metres of shelf space.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 So the thing I'll just quickly go through his life because he's a completely mad individual.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 I think he's quite famous in America.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 He was this writer, architect, scientist, inventor, general thinker.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 He did an awful lot for science.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 He did an awful lot for science fiction.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 He was that kind of area, very kind of theoretical.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 When he was much younger, he wasn't very good at school, but he did a lot of practical mechanics.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 He had all sorts of jobs inventing from age 12.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 He went to Harvard and got expelled twice.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 I can't find anyone else has been expelled twice.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 The first time was suspending all his money on a massive party with a vaudeville troupe.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 He just took all of the money that he could find and spend all on one big party.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 And the second time was for general irresponsibility and lack of interest.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 So I mean, that's pretty impressive.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 So he was he was mechanic for a had lots of random jobs in 1927.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 He's daughter died of polio and he went into a very deep depression for about a year.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 He was on the brink of suicide.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 He went to the edge of Lake Michigan, I think it was, and supposedly had an outer body experience and came out of it realizing,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 "Okay, I've got to develop the rest of my life to helping to the advance of humanity."

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 So he immediately went into overdrive for the rest of his life and invented all these weird things,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 made interesting concepts, became went into lecturing and did these incredible lecture circuit tours.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 He wants to just, I mean, because this is a man who his diary takes up as we say 80 meters of shelf space.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 So he was writing his diary every 15 minutes, wasn't he?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 So every 15 minutes, adding new stuff to it, he once gave a 42 hour long video lecture.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 And it's on YouTube and if you haven't seen it, it's one of his finest moments.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 So not straight, I'm sure there must have been 42 minute lectures.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 No, no, someone once said, and this lecture, by the way, was called "Everything I Know."

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 But some people who had actually, I read an article by someone whose friend was one of his students,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 and they said that he could go for no break with no notes from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with just not stopping.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 It's just a lecture that, and people used to stay that long because it was a marathon of amazing information coming out from this guy.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 It was very deep, like he was one of the early people to start thinking about the environment.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 And he came up with this thing that he called "The World Game," which on the face of it is basically,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 how can we make things better for everybody in terms of justice, poverty, education,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 with the limited resources that we have because the earth is not infinite?

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 And he loved the word "diamaxian."

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 Now what's the origin of?

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 So I think he used it when he was talking to some friends, when he was explaining something,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 and it's a dynamism, maximum, and ion of the three. It's a poor mancher of those three.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 And it was sort of his brand. He all the inventions, he could have put this name to it.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 So his diary, he called "The Diamaxian Chronophile," which is a great name.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 So the thing he's probably most famous coming up with is the G.R.D. Sixth Fair,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 which is a structure that is spherical, made of triangles, or a polygon shape.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 And it's this amazingly futuristic piece of architecture, really.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 I really love that he came up with it, and then a few years later, it was discovered in nature.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 And he was really big about taking, he really liked the idea of taking designs from nature

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 because those are going to be the best designs, but he actually found this one.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 And it was found to be in a type of carbon, which is now called Buckman's to Fullerine.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Oh wow.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 Do you know the amazing thing about Buckman's to Fullerine?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 Is that footballs are in the shape of Buckman's to Fullerine molecules.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 They're a mix of, what is it? Triangles and some hexagons.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 So the Eden project is another example of one of those domes.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 It's made, that one's made of hexagons, but obviously you can divide that up his triangles.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 And the Eden project was originally an association football, and they just kept inflating it.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 They never stopped.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 Do you know what, so the Eden project is, the whole building is basically a massive inflatable tent.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Whenever there's a puncture, which is quite a lot, because they just tape it up.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Does you know that?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 It's just covered in plaster, like a bicycle park.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 Well, because I read that he had a house, which was made of this globe as well.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 And he had a leak, so they tried to get it fixed.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 And as they were fixing it, they burnt the whole place down.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 Yeah, so fixing it with fire.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 I have no idea what they did, but maybe that's why they just sell it to things now.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 So his invention that I like most.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 So he made this car of which I think there's only one left now that we have called the Dimaxi in Vehicle,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 which looked like a Zeppelin, and it had three wheels.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 And apparently when it came out, it was the hit of all cars.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 It could apparently maneuver itself to a 180 on the spot.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 So if you were driving, it could literally just go woo!

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Because it had back wheel steering.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 It had fixed front wheels and a single rotating back wheel.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 That's incredible.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 And no rear-view mirror.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 It had a periscope.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 It just sounds like...

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 And I've seen a picture.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 It looks like a Kombi van.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 It's yeah, and he aspired to make it fly later on.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 But that never came back.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 But it was so unfair because there was the first prototype of the Dimaxi in Vehicle.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 It'd been on the road for three months, and it was being shown off at the Chicago World's Fair.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 And it was involved in a crash, which killed the driver.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 But it was, I'm seriously injured, a passenger.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 But it wasn't the fault of that car.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 It was another car which had caused the accident.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 But it sort of set the world against it.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 And I think only two more were built.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 And as you say, there's only one surviving today.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Yeah.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 So he deliberately built it not so much as a car.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 But as something that included car-like properties.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 So he thought it would be something that would go on water and in the air.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 And in fact it was unstable at high speeds on the highway.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Because that's what you needed for us properties to be a moving vehicle.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 So he saw it as an intermediate stage.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 And it specifically said that it should be driven only by people who were skilled in it.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 In other words, it's a really unstable vehicle, really scary.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 And you can kill yourself if you try to drive like a normal car on highway speeds.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 But it was great. He came up with 10 cigarettey things as well.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Amazing.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 I was just fine. He invented everything for himself.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 He invented his own sleep cycle.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 He slept.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 He would spend six hours awake and 30 minutes asleep.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 And he spent two years doing that.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 And he says the only reason he gave it up was because his colleagues couldn't keep up with the schedule.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 Because he would have 22 hours in the day when he was working.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 How did he keep up the diary if he updated every 15 minutes?

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 I don't know.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 But I mean, maybe he just went back because he knew he was sleeping.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 He used to be like 202 sleeping.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 How many years did he keep the diary going for?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 1920 to 1983.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 The half a century.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 He started it when he was 25, finished it.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 He included everything he ever wrote apparently since he was four years old.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 So he obviously kept everything and then put it all together in a diary.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 Did you hear the story about how he died?

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 Yes.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 It's kind of like the notebook.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 The movie the note, but he basically he was according to some sources.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 How he died was he was at his wife's bedside and she was in a coma.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 And so he was visiting her at hospital.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 They said that he got over excited by the fact that he felt as if she had squeezed his hand back.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 As if he had had some contact and the over excitement is kind of what ended him.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 And they both died.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 I think it was in the same week and within hours.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 Within hours, right.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Yeah.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 I mean, it's very.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Yeah.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 He had to have what he has on his gravestone.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 Yeah.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 Call me trim tab, which is the trim tab is a little mechanical component in aeroplane that makes tiny movements,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 but moves the entire rudder of blame.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 And that makes that that steers an entire plane.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 And that was what he wanted to be.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 He wanted to be.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 He really believed that a single person can make a huge difference.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 So he wanted to be that person that was helping to govern humanity and to greater.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 He popularized the phrase, spaceship birth.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 He was one of the people who was really blind.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 I love that.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 I love the idea that the earth is a spaceship.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 We have limited resources and we need to act as a big team to kind of keep it running.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 It's such a good message, isn't it?

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 It's so good.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 I've got one last thing on him.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 He released an LP.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 A music album.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 No.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Yes, he did.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 No, so it includes a song which you can see on YouTube.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 You can see him actually singing on YouTube.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 So it's the, you know, the song Home on the Range.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 So he's saying that, but he rewrote the lyrics to call it "Rome Home to a Dome".

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Oh.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 Yeah.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 And that's on YouTube.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 It was very, very favorite of Buckminster Fuller's inventions.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 He, when he used stairs, didn't say I'm going upstairs or downstairs.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 He said, I'm going in stairs or out stairs because you're either going in towards the center of the planet.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 Or you're going out away from the center of the planet.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 That was his thing about spaceship earth.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 It just makes you think, oh yeah, I am actually moving towards the center of the earth.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Whereas I thought I was going downstairs.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 Right.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 He specializes in making up his own words.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 He was somewhat convoluted.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 He was really convoluted.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 It's really convoluted.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 It's like Omni Self Regenerative, Omni Wellin, he loved Omni, everything was Omni.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 He also claimed to have invented the word debunk.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 Yeah.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 But no one can debunk it because he's out of his mind.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 He's out of his mind.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 He's out of his mind.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 He's out of his mind.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 Okay, time for our final fact of the show.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 And that is my fact.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 My fact this week is that Australian scientists have recently named a newly discovered species of fish.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 Blue bastard.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 That's the name that they've given it.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 There is a Latin name that they've given this fish, which is something I cannot pronounce.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 It's so long.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 Do you want to have a go?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 I'll have a go.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 I think it's called Plectorinches chiruleonothus.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 Yep.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 So it's the chiruleonothus, which when you break it down into two separate words, is blue in Latin and bastard.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 It's quite nice because that was apparently it was a local fish in Australia.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 That was apparently it was a local fish in Australia that the fishermen, the local fishermen used to call blue bastard

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 because they weren't quite sure what it was.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 They eventually got their hands on it.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 Scientists and they named it as a species found out it was a new species.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 And yeah.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 And that's...

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 They called it blue because it was blue in colour.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 It started off with a yellowish colour and the older it got, the bluer it got.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 And bastard because it was really hard to catch.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 Because it hung around in murky waters where there were either sharks or crocodiles or both.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 And it came into the modern parlance via some fisherman in Weeper photographing it.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 And here's something weird for you.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 Weeper is one of the few places in the world where instead of getting two high tides and two low tides a day,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 you want to get one?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 That was in my eighth book.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 [Laughter]

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Oh, how come?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Because you get the water flooding into the rivers from the high tide.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 And as it comes back, it exactly counteracts the next tide.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 The low tide fills it out and smers it out into nothing.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 Think of a bathtub and then a large breadboard.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 Then with a breadboard, it went into the bathtub, it's full of water.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 You just sort of pat.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 And then you wait for the wave to go down to the other end and come back.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 And then depending on when you do the next pat, you can either wipe out the wave.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 Or you can build it up into something that will swoosh over the edge.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 So it's a resonance thing. I found that out by talking to people at the National Tidal Centre in Flinders University of Australia.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 You've got it by dropping a breadboard into a bathtub.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 I've been finding out about Australian fish because we've got a lot of great Australian.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 You guys have a lot of great Australian fish.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Thank you.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 The number of fish that you've got.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 You've got unicorn cod, squirrel fishes, wasp fishes, armored sea robins.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 I love this out of an armored sea robin.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 Sea bats, wolf herrings.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Gobble guts, pony fishes.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 Gobble guts sounds very Aussie.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 Gobble guts is amazing.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 I can't remember whether this is Australian or not, but there is a fish called the Slippery Dick.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 Just one of them.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 Yeah, I don't think it is an Aussie, but yeah, there is one called the Slippery Dick.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 It's a creature's lot of mucous.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 I've just got a couple of things just because as an Australian, very proud that all these species of fish are being named in a nice Australian fashion.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 And it was also big news for Australian science because the ignobiles, the prizes that make you laugh and make you think, awarded a prize to an Australian scientist.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 And it was a chemistry professor called Colin Rasten and he's worked out how to unboil an egg.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 And so that he won an award for unboiling an egg.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Which means that you could unboil it.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Separate out the yolk and give it to the people who are allergic to the white.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 Yeah.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 But is it if your eggs been incorrectly boiled, you can say, take this back, please unboil it and re-boil it for three minutes.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 And off a six.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Well, it might be when you're at home and you've eaten too much.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 What are we going to do with this boiled egg?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 Let's unboil it and re-boil it on duty.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 No, I don't want to boil it once you've eaten it.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 All right.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 What about mad cow disease?

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 Proteins.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 Uh-huh.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 Right.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 So imagine we have a situation where in the United Kingdom, some people are carrying pre-ons, prions, PR-I-O-N-S in their blood.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 Which are just proteins that have been misformed.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 And when they kiss another similar protein, they misform that.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 Imagine you can reverse the process.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 Ah, see, it makes you think and it makes you laugh and learn at the same time the ignobiles.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 I do love the ignoble prizes.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 And I should mention at the beginning that I myself have won an ignoble prizes.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 That's extraordinary.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 So for those listening who don't know what the ignoble prizes are, that is the yearly award system given to scientists who first come up with research.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 That in the eyes of the ignobiles make you laugh and then make you think.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 That's right.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 Laugh and learn.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 And my groundbreaking research was for belly button fluff and why it's almost always blue.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 No.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 And for that, I got my ignoble prizes.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 And Harvard showed me so much respect that they flew me all away from Sydney to Harvard at my own expense.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 They would not insult me by offering me money.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 That's how much respect it is.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 That is how highly valued this prize is and then for the next month I had people wanting to have a section as a share of my $1 million prize,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 which they thought was wrongly the noble prize, not the ignoble prize.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 It was sort of red wind up chattering teeth on a stick.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 Right, that was the prize.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 That was the prize.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 On a tile written in very bad, it's the colour that faded immediately.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Right.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 Wow, I didn't realise we had the ignoble prize.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 I was trying to keep someone out of part from bringing it up into every conversation I possibly can as a very first sentence.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 So not only is Colin Raston and yourself, Dr. Carl, ignoble winners.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 There are more.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 Lawyers prefer to call themselves.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 Nick Enfield.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 He did have it.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 Yeah, he works out that.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 It was a universal word amongst languages, universal word amongst languages.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 Is there a universal meeting?

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 Huh.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 Huh.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 Hey, there's an Australian was called aha.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 It was discovered by a guy called Arnold Minky in 1977 and he called it that because he went aha when he found it.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 So where does the actual har, sorry, the additional har.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 I don't know where the second har comes from, but it's called aha.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 That's when he told someone about it and they said aha.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 So his number plate.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Did he name the fish after his number plate?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 No, he got the number plate.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 He was very proud.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 It was a wasp.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 Sorry, sorry wasp.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Can I can I mention one more ignoble winner, which was it was in the mathematics prize for the ignobels and it was a some Australian scientists and they want it for calculating the number of photographs that mathematically will make it highly unlikely that anyone in a group photo has their eyes closed.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 Oh, Nick, she was my work experience person.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 Oh, really?

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Yeah, I'm like, well, I bring this up because it's the subject of photos and when we were looking into just a few things about you as you were coming on the show.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 We discovered that you have a claim to the coining of the word selfie.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 You're a part of its origin story.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 Yeah.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 So way back in 2012, this is in my 34th book, The House of Karlsman.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 Maybe I don't forget the name this too many times.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 So a guy called Nigel Hope here after known as Hopi because we Australian shortened things down remove all the following syllables and just put a vowel in so not afternoon but arvo and Hopi

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 posted that he had fallen over and he'd put his teeth through his lower lip and he had a stitch and she was itchy and how long would it take to stop itching.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 And then the dialogue flowed backwards and forwards and it's 3.19 in the afternoon, I forget the exact day in 2003.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 I think it was something September.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 He then posted, look, okay, guys, I was drunk.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 I fell over.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 Here's a selfie.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 Sorry, it's out of focus.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 Here's a photo of my face.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 Sorry, it's out of focus.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Here's the exact words.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Sorry, it's out of focus, comma.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 It's a selfie.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 And that, according to the Oxford English Dictionary who made that word, the word of the year in 2013, that was the first time ever in the history of the human race, that the word was written down in any medium, now known all here after yet to be devised and guess whose home page it appeared on.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 Mine.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 Dr. Carl Q&A home page.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 That's so good.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get in touch with any of us about the things we said over the course of this podcast, we can all be found on Twitter.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 I'm on @Sriberland.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 Alex.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 Alex Bell under school.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 Andy.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 Andrew Hunter M.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 Dr. Carl.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 D-O-C-T-O-R-K-A-R-L.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 The long version.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 The long version of Dr. Carl?

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 Okay, so you can also go to Dr. Carl's website. He has so many blogs. They're amazing. We find a lot of the stuff on this show through Dr. Carl. He's absolutely here as far as.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 And if you want to hear our other episodes, you can go to no such thing as fish.com. We've got our backlog of episodes there. We will be back again next week. Thank you so much for listening. See you then. Goodbye.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 [Music]

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 That architect saying, "I was soliciting, rich clients and hards to their knees, just give your home in a great circle down, where the stresses and strains are at ease. Run home to a door on the crest of a neighboring hill, where the chores are all done.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 Before they've begun, that eclectic nonsense is near. Let modern folk scream, out glass boxes are seen, out of lungs, superb of the way, split levels, split lungs, split red minerals, no down money, life time to die. Run home to a door.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 No backer would back will you die? No mortgage to show? No payments to go? Well, you dream well and spend your own time."

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 [Applause]

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 I'm shy about the voice, but... [Laughter]
