00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 >> And welcome to another episode of No Stop Sinners of Fish.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 A weekly podcast this week coming to you from the Soho Theater in Central London.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 My name is Dan Shriver.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 I'm sitting here with the three regular elves.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 It's James Harkin, Andy Murray, and Anna Chazinski.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 And once again, we've got around the microphone with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 James.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 >> Okay.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 My fact this week is that the 2012 law prohibiting nudity in San Francisco was proposed by a politician called Scott Wiener.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Keeping it high, Brown.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 >> Yeah.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 >> Yeah.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Just like I just like funny names, really.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 >> Yeah, that's my favorite thing.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 It's also it's that nominative determinism thing, isn't it?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 >> Yeah.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 >> We've actually met the person who coined nominative determinism.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 >> Really?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 >> Yes, it's Mr. Determinism.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 >> Yes, Mr. Determinism.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 >> No, it's a British guy called John Hoyland.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Sadly, he passed away last year.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 But he used to write for new sciences, and he coined it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 And he coined it because he saw on the same day two things when he was out in the shops.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 The first thing was he saw a book that had come out on the Arctic by a Mr. Snowman.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 And in that very same day, he read a scientific paper on incontinence by J. W. Splatt.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 And D. Weedon.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 >> Weedon and Splatt.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 It's quite a famous paper, that is.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 >> Is it?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 >> Yeah.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 >> Wait, Mr. Snowman.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 >> Yeah, Mr. Snowman.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 >> Is that a name?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Does anyone here know anyone called Snowman?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 I don't think it's it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 How can it be a name?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 And he often denies the existence of people introduced to him if he doesn't agree with their name.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 So after finding this guy called Scott Weiner, I tried to look for other political names in America,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 funny ones, and good old BuzzFeed has one.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 It has a list of the 31 weirdest political names, and I want to give you a few of those.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 So the former House representative from New Hampshire called Dick Sweat.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Precinct committeeman from Arizona Frank Schmuck.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 This is my favourite one, it's not rude, but Butch Otter, who was the current covener of Idaho.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 But Butch Otter is such a good name, that's it.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 I'd vote for Butch Otter.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 And there was Anthony Weiner, wasn't there?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 I mean, you know, who'd flash people via text or something a couple of years ago?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Oh, yeah, that was right.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 That was Anthony Weiner.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 It was, yeah.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 I'd never thought about how technology has sort of made the flashing immunity way more

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 than the relaxing stay at home.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Usually it was really hands-on, wasn't it?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 You had to go out of the street.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Yeah, hands-on.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Actually hands-on was a whole different crime.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 What do we think of, so sort of the reverse thing, which is popular among celebrities now,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 naming your child after where they were conceived or after something that's significant to them?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Which goes back longer than I thought.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 So Brooklyn Beckham.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Brooklyn Beckham, yeah, I think.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 And so in 1863, a boy was born and he was named Leicester Railway.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 He was born at Leicester train station.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Oh, I get born.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Born, born.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Yeah.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 But Rojard Kippling is named after the place where his parents either met or conceived him.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Rojard Leic, which is in Staffordshire, I think.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Yeah.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 So my reasoning went through all the censuses from 1790 to 1930 finding all the funny names there.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 And there were some really good ones.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Some of the best ones.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 So parents, Mr and Mrs. Day, in 1899, named their son Time of.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 1899.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Yeah.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 1899, time of day.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Yeah.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 I didn't think people had that kind of sense of humour back then.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 I know, I know.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 And yeah, so also in the 19th century, they found I'm a hog.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 I'm a pig.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 I'm a nut.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 And I'm a hooker.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 I wish I'd guessed the name I'm a winter fashion eventually, as you can't say.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 I was snowman, would've been good.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 So, okay.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 So this guy, where is he banned?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 New to see?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 San Francisco.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 So was it not banned there?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 Was that the first time he'd been banned in public?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Because it's not banned in all places.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 It's not banned in the UK, for instance.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 It's not allowed to go around naked as long as you don't deliberately cause harassment or alarm or distress.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Yeah.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 I found out that so you can go to, you know, like youth camps in America.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 There's now a youth summer camp that's a nudist camp.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Because it was thought that, I guess, young teenagers didn't have enough opportunity to engage in nudism or whatever.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 But there's a rule at this summer camp.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 So I think there are three or four of them in, like, Florida, Texas, Arizona.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 There's a rule that, on the occasions that you do wear clothing.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 So occasionally, they'll be scenarios where you put on some clothes.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 It's not allowed to be sexually alluring.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 One of the first other guys to be arrested for--

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 I find for indecent exposure was-- this was in 1927.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 And can anyone guess the part of himself you revealed?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 OK.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 His bottom.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 No, it was his chest.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Oh, really?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 And some bathing just took his shirt off.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 And that was it.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 He was-- he was fined and arrested.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Yeah, and the magistrate said, I'm going to hold rightly or wrongly that to expose the upper part of your body is indecent.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 I think it is highly likely to shock persons of ordinary sensibility.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 I, in summer in London, I'm actually in a very nice--

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 There was speaking of Topless, there's a really weird story in 1842 where there was up for war because--

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 so this was reported in a northern newspaper.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 And it was that women who worked down mines were being photographed topless.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 And it turned-- it was all over the newspapers.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 And it turned out that women were working topless down mines because it was really, really hot.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 And I think it turned out it was only in one mine.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 It was a hotwood mine in Barnsley.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 And there was suddenly this big campaign saying women shouldn't be working down mines because it was seen as indecent

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 that they were apparently being forced to be topless.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 That's art.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Oh, that's weird.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 I was just reading today actually in Mongolia.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 They have an annual sporting event called the Three Mumbly Sports.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 And one of them's wrestling and one of them's throwing something.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 And the wrestling one, it's only men.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 And the way that they find that out is they make sure that they wrestle topless so that you could tell the difference

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 if there's a woman wrestling.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Because they're very obvious other way of finding that out.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Not like during a wrestling match, though.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Oh yeah, what about that fact about Princess Anne was the only person not to be gender tested in the 19--

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Seven, two.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Some Olympics, are they?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 The Olympics, yeah.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 She could be a man.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Oh, nobody knows for sure.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 She had not saying that Princess Anne is a man.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Aniris.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 We're just saying we can't rule it out.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 So I was looking into nudity, which is extremely hard to do on the internet.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 So hard.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 The distractions available.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 But I started looking into strip teeth because I suddenly thought,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 "Oh, I don't know the history of strip teasing."

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 So that's hard to answer.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 That's pretty weird.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Every week.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 But I'm surprised how far it goes back.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 I mean, it goes back to, like, I think it was the 1700s.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 And what's really weird is, is that they used to strip teas in front of--

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 it would be in a court, and you would be just having a fun night.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 And then the strip teas would start.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 And I always said that strip teas was accompanied by music.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 While thinking the music back then wasn't exactly the sexiest.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 Yeah, when you got your harpsichord out.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 There's not really a kind of sexy song to go with the strip teas.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 And then I read that.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 A big thing that actually puts strip teasing around the world is more of an art form.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 There was Gustav Flober.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 Flober.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 He saw an Arab custom that he saw in Egypt, which was this dance.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 It was the dance of the bee.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Oh, is it the one where she takes off her clothes?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 Because she thinks she's got a bee inside her clothes.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Yeah, again.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Not very sexy, but what she's so--

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 It's just like--

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 It seems like strip teasing, like, slowly introduced the idea of sexuality much later in the day.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 I think strip tease must go back further than that, though.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Yeah.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 If you Google nudity--

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Right.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 And obviously, you have to be quite careful.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 But the results that came up for me, you know the autocomplete options on Google,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 were nudity in Far Cry 4, which is a computer game.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 nudity crossword clue.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 So when it's nudity in Dragon Age inquisition, not a computer game.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 But then I realised these are tailored to me.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 I don't own either of those games.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 Until now.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 You wanted them, presumably.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 I wanted to see if there was any political parties who were up for nudity.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 And so I googled the National nudity Party.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 And I found only one here.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 It was a Facebook page, and it had one like the National nudity Party.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 And it was a guy called Nenad Philopovitch from Serbia.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 He's the only member of the Facebook National nudity Party.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 It's not much of a party, isn't it?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 I mean, I--

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 I've had some really dead parties in my time, but that was bad.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 The first ever nudist-- the first ever organised nudist movement was set up by just three people.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 They were Englishmen living in Bombay in 1890.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 And they just like the dress codes of the British ranch, which are very, you know,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 you had so much, and it was very hot.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 And so they established a group called The Fellowship of the Naked Trust.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 And they began to meet together in the nude.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 And they were the only three members that lasted for just two years.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 And then they stopped.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 And I just-- I want to know what happened at least.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 I presume nothing much happened at these meetings.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Just three men--

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 There's something happened for it to start, didn't it?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Someone stepped over a boundary, no?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 I was looking into the history of clothing, because I thought--

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 Apparently, for the majority of our time on Earth, we have been naked.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 String, apparently, is what changed everything.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 The invention of string, because it meant you could harness--

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 You know, it really could be harness.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 So string was really hard to make.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 So they ended up-- they used hemp.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Hemp was the big thing that would, you know, you could put into small strips.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 You could wear it in larger patches.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 And the thing about hemp was it was going really well.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 And everyone was using it.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 And then suddenly they discovered that you could smoke hemp.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 You get really high.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 And then they all got naked again.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 Stoned off their asses.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 The ass of hemp turned into a high as a result of clothing.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 The other thing is that in the early American times,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 they used hemp for their ships as well.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 And they needed the hemp.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 And no one really wanted to grow it.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 They all wanted to grow food, because you got more money.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 But so one of the first-- in fact, it was the first ever drug law in America

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 was to make it that you had to grow hemp.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Yeah.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 I just read in my notes.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 I've actually misspelled this when I was writing about nudity

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 and a surge in nude crises.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 And I actually meant to write cruises, which I have been a surge in.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Which is not a crisis.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 But they have been a surge in nude cruises.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 And also the first new charted flight by a German air--

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 German to this company yet.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 You know, in Germany, so I haven't been to beaches in Germany.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 So this is just what I've read.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 But most beaches are named.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 You'll have signs on the beaches.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 FKK is one sign.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 And that points to Freikorper Culfer, which is a free body culture.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 And that's the naked part.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 And then you have the one that's called the textile beach.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Which really does sound like the losers beach.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 The knitting beach.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Do you know about German agricultural nudist traditions?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 They're good.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 Try me.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 OK.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 So lots of different bits of Germany have nudity related customs

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 to encourage the crops and the harvest.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 So, for example, in Salfeldt,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 a woman would walk around the Flaxfields naked

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 on a particular night of the year.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 And in the eight-- this went until the 19th century

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 where women in Rydlingen would walk naked

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 and urinate in the Flaxfields, urging the crops to grow

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 as high as their breasts.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 And men did the same thing as well.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 Men would walk around the sorps.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 They would walk naked in the fields chanting, "Flax. Flax.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 Flax. Grow as high as the scrotum."

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 So, the men's crop is weren't growing as high.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 All right.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 We got to move on to our second fact.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 So, time for fact number two.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 Fact number two is my fact.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 My fact this week is that Charles Darwin's grandfather,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Erasmus Darwin, got so large that he couldn't fit

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 at his dinner table anymore.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 Rather than going on an exercise regime,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 he decided to cut a semi-circle in the table

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 so he could fit his stomach here and continue eating.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 It's just wonderful decision-making.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Yeah.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 And that's an example of why he was such a genius, all right?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 Absolutely.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 Yeah, so he-- I mean, this is the thing.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 I've never heard of Erasmus Darwin

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 because obviously his grandson, Charles,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 really is dominating the cold inches.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 But he was extraordinary.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 Yeah, but Erasmus Darwin was awesome.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 He was as serious polymath, wasn't he?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 He's like the epitome of polymath.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 And he came up with loads of inventions, really cool inventions,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 some of which actually did work.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 So the steam car, very early person

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 to experiment with steam and create a steam-operated vehicle,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 a wire-drawn, very horizontal windmill.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 I don't know why that's useful for, but whatever.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 No.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Hey, who's experimenting?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 I know how windmill work.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 There's more-- all right, go on.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 I will.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 An artificial bird.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 And a magnetically-operated fake spider.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 It's so really cool, like an early jute toy.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 He also invented-- he came up with an idea

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 of using hydrogen balloons to increase the amount

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 that could be carried in wheelbarrows.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 That's a good idea.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 It's a good idea.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 He sounds really clever.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 But then I also read that he once tried

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 to cure a five-year-old boy's problem

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 with squinting by fixing a ginormous fake nose

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 to his face.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 And that was his solution.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 He was like, this is definitely work.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Just walk around.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 This will be fine.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 Do you know if it worked?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 Well, no one noticed he's squinting anymore.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 The thing about the balloons-- I just remembered, actually--

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Benjamin Franklin, he had a number of other ideas

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 for hydrogen balloons.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 And one of them was that he would put his food,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 attach his food to a hydrogen balloon,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 and then he would let it go miles into the air

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 to keep it cool so you wouldn't need a refrigerator.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 And they would keep the food cool up there.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 And when you wanted it, you just shoot it down.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 The food would come down, you could eat it, and it'd be cold.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 That is much more convenient than a refrigerator.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 I'm amazed we're not all doing it.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 Apparently he was really attractive to women, though,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 despite being so corpulent.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 He sounds like a really charismatic guy.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Women fancy to him.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 He was a bit of a female magnet.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 I think you have 16 children?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 Yeah.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 12 of them legitimate to not.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 Yeah.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 Should have invented the condom.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 But one of the cool things about him

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 is he kind of inspired Mary Shelley to write Frankenstein.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 There it is.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Yeah.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 So when they were all Mary Shelley and Byron

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 and Percy Shelley, they were all staying in Lake Geneva

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 and they were telling each other ghost stories.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 And Mary Shelley writes in her diary, she says,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 "Byron and Shelley had a load of conversations

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 to which I was a devout, but nearly silent listener."

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 I eat, they were going on about it.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 They talked with the experiments of Dr. Darwin,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 who supposedly preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 What does vermicelli say?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 It's a worm.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 It means little worm.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 It was a small worm, wasn't it?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 Well, I think it's pasta, because--

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 No, no.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 No.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 And then he brought the pasta to life.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 He brought the pasta to life.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 And I've missed research.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 I was not useful for anyone.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 That would have been a very thing with it.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 I think it's still pasta.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 It would have made a very different Frankenstein.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 You just have to get lots of hot water over it,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 and then you just go like this.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 I think it was a worm, but whatever.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 And he meant what you kind of came up with the theory of evolution,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 for which Charles gets all the credit now.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 Yeah.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 But he came up with lots of early iterations of the theory of evolution.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Yeah, he didn't do natural selection, did he?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 But he thought that everything came from something smaller,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 something very, very-- like a very tiny piece of pasta.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 Yeah.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 Everything grew from there.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 But he didn't realize survival of the fetus.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 He didn't really have that.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Just speaking of Charles Orwin, I read a thing about him,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 which I really thought was extraordinary about the times.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 So when he went on the Beagle trip, he wasn't the naturalist

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 on the Beagle trip.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 And actually, we went to-- three of us, I think,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 went to the Welcome Institute that you can go to in London.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 And they have this kind of-- there's this behind-the-scenes area

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 where they have all these amazing documents

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 that no one sees in the public, one of which

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 is the diaries of the naturalist from the Beagle.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 And what's amazing about it is the naturalist spent more time

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 just going, who the fuck is this Darwin guy?

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 And it's literally a bitch diary, the whole thing going on.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 And he's talking about tortoises

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 and this theory of them-- it was so bitchy.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 And they've never published it.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 They really need to.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 But Darwin almost didn't make it onto the Beagle

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 because Fitzroy, who was the captain,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 didn't like the shape of his nose.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Yeah.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 He thought he believed in what was the theory that--

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Physiognomy.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 Physiognomy, yeah.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 Which meant that you could tell someone's personality

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 by their physical traits.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 And he thought it meant Darwin was arrogant and stubborn.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 It was just a theory in those days that you could tell

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 if someone's personality by the shape of their face

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 or you would have people who looked a bit like criminal or so.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 And actually, it's dated back all the way back to Roman times.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 And also, I mean, we say their eyes are too close together.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 I mean, it remains today.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 We do make judgements based on people's physical characteristics.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 I do.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 Never trusted you.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 This is quite funny, but if we don't want Darwin's family,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 so Darwin married his cousin, which is quite well known.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 But I like the fact that one of his sons called George

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 became an academic and one of the only academic papers

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 that we know about that existed that was published--

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 was published in the Journal of the Statistical Society.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 And it was titled "Marriages Between First Cousins in England

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 and Their Effects."

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 So he was both the author and the subjects of that--

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 Yep.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 He wanted Parliament to add at Charles Darwin,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 this is, wanted Parliament to add a question to the census.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 They did.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Saying, are you married to your first cousin?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 Have you noticed anything going wrong?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 And they wouldn't do it.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 They wouldn't allow him to add that question to the census.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 They said it was too personal.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 I read a sentence about Charles Darwin,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 and I know nothing more about it because I just saw,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 I don't want to go further than this.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 The sentence was, Charles Darwin hated religious controversy

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 because it exacerbated his bowel problems.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Please, Charles, with mine.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 Well, Erasmus Darwin, just going back to him,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 he got in a lot of trouble because he didn't believe

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 in the Judeo-Christianic God.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 He still believed in God, but just not the main one.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 And he believed in, like, some kind of distant entity.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 And I think he changed his-- because he believed in evolution,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 he changed his family crest to everything from shells

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 or something like that.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 He put those words on it, yeah.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 He was wrong.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 He was wrong.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 Well, in the specifics, yes.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 But in the general thrust, no.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 Yeah.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Just going back to his inventions as well,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 he invented a circulating swing to cure madness.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 It's a spinning thing.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 You put a person who's got mental issues back in the day.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 They have one at Bedlam.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 You would put them in this machine.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 It would spin them around, make them feel nauseous.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 They would vomit, lose control of their bladder and bowels,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 some blood from the nose and ears,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 some had convulsions and many passed out.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 Then he stopped the machine as suddenly as he could,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 and this invariably had a calming effect

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 subduing even the most violent patience.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 So what?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 Do you still feel angry?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 You see, you're saying nothing.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 Your fact was about tables, right?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 Yes.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 I don't know.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 It feels like a long time ago now.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 So my favourite table, I think, is a table.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 We've all got one.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 Welcome to my favourite table.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 It's my spin-off show, one episode.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 It was Louis the 16th,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 and it was in his château at Choisy,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 which I'm guessing is somewhere in France,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 and it was his table of volunt,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 and it was because he got annoyed at the fact that between courses,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 the servants would have to come and bring you your food,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 so they would have to take away your plates

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 and bring you your main course up to your starter.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 And he thought, "This is really disruptive."

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 So what he may have in what?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 He cut a huge hole around the dining room table,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 and he had it lowered into the servant's quarters between courses,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 so the servants down below could stock it up,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 and then raise it back up to their level,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 which apparently was less disruptive than everything.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Was he friends with Benjamin Franklin by any chance?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 That's a good table.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 That's a good one to start the series, I think.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 I think it is, yeah.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 A few carpulent people.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 Yeah. Daniel Lambert, he was the fattest man ever when he was alive,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 weighed 318 kilograms.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 He was the heaviest man in history,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 but John Brower, who died in 1983,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 he weighed over 635 kilograms.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 So even though this guy was the biggest at the time,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 we've gone twice as big now.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 And Lambert was so fat, apparently, that he couldn't sink.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 He was now.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 I'm not sure how that works.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 There's something with that.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 And he was from Leicester,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 and he would float along the river's tower,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 allowing children to hitch a lift on his own.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 It was a more innocent time.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 He was really strong.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 He once fought a bear in the streets of Leicester.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Why was a bear in the streets of Leicester?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 I don't know, but you've got to be glad that he's there when it happens.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 He gets out of the water.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 Get down.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Sorry, kids.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 You've got to find a bear.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 And then he got so famous,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 and he exhibited himself in a house in Piccadilly in London,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 and people would go and pay to chat to him,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 because apparently he's quite a raccoon to her as well.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 And at the same time as he was exhibiting himself in Piccadilly,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 down the road on Sackville Street,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 there was a fat baby known as Master Wybrance,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Mr. Lumber's in miniature.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 How many people would go to see this fat baby?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 Just while they were there.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 It's like if they could get a ticket for Lumber, they'd go and see either.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Like the fringe.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 It was a fringe event.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 Exactly.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Yeah.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Surely they did a double act.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Yeah, they should have done, shouldn't they?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 It's in our theory why humans have put on weight

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 in the last couple of centuries,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 as well as all the dietary change.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 But another theory is that humans all used to weigh less,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 and this is hundreds and thousands of years ago,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 because they were constantly exposed to infections

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 and infected with stuff.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 And when you're infected, when you're fighting an infection,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 your body warms up and you burn calories for more of them.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 I know.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 So that's the answer is to just constantly be ill.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 Well, people think that though obesity might be infectious,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 and I like this because it's a good excuse for obesity.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 But yeah, there's this theory.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 They've tried it on mice where they've implanted bacteria

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 from obese humans into a mouse guts.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 And then they took another bunch of mice and implanted bacteria

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 from like normal weight humans into different mouse guts.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 And the mouse guts with the bacteria from the fat humans got fat.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 And then and the mouse got mice with the bacteria

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 from the not fat humans didn't get fat.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 And then when they put all the mice together,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 the thin mice were infected with the fat mouse bacteria,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 and they all got fat.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 So they think the fatness might be infectious caused by bacteria in your stomach,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 which I don't believe, but you would like to.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 Guys, we've got to move on to our next fact.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 Time is against it.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Okay, time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 My fact is that Spotify's random function is not random.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 It used to be random.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 It used to play any random song,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 but then human listeners kept inferring order and seeing patterns

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 where there weren't any patterns.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 So now they've had to change the algorithm,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 so it's structured, but in such a way that human listeners think that it's random.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 Can I just ask quickly, who were the non-human listeners?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 That's amazing.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 So we see patterns in the algorithm.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 It's not there.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 And so they had to create a fake one.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 Yeah.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 So if you've got five different genres of music in a normal, completely random pattern,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 occasionally you get clumps or clusters,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 where it would play two or three jazz songs in the same consecutively,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 and they've had to change it.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 So it now completely mixes up the genres.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 So yeah, they've had to abandon actual randomness.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Or it doesn't completely mix up the genres.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Even spread the mouse out to proper intervals.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 Yeah.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 Because people don't believe.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 Yeah.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Because people just can't kind of figure out randomness.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 Humans can't really come.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 If you ask everyone in this room to stand randomly somewhere in the room,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 then they'll all spread out pretty much equally.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 Yeah.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 Well, actually in real life, there'd be clumps everywhere.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 Yeah.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 But don't do that, guys.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 No.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 It's the gambler's fallacy, isn't it?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 It's the thing that makes gamblers think that if they've been 20 reds in a row on a roulette machine,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 it's because the 21st is going to be not a red, and it's just not true.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 I think the first instance, so the first time I was reported and studied within 1913 when a roulette ball fell on black 26 times in a row,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 and all gamblers are going, "Come on, it's not possible. It can't do it again."

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Yeah, I also think that's not possible.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 That's amazing, isn't it?

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 One thing they didn't say is that on that roulette wheel, there'd been a mistake with the order

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 of the work experience boy painted them all black.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Yeah.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 You're actually going to change the back.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 So if you get someone to put a random list of 30 coin flips, say,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 and I actually flip the coin 30 times, and you do a random number, like HT, HT, whatever,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 you'll be able to tell which is the manmade one just by looking at it.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 And that's because--

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 Because even--

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 Yeah, because most, if you do 30, you're likely to get about 5 in a row which are either heads or tails,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 but no human would do that.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 Yeah, it seems impossible.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 Yeah, so it used to be a machine you could get called an out-guessing machine,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 and they had those in America, I think it was in the 50s,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 and you would have to choose either left or right.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 You would say left, and the machine would have to guess whether you said left or right.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 And then you would keep doing that, and eventually it would guess almost every time,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 because humans just go into a pattern.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 Yeah, it's like what paper scissors on the New York Times.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 You can play rock paper scissors, can't you?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 And it's the same thing.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 And the game learns, as it plays against you, what your patterns are.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 So the more you play it, the less like you are to win it, because it becomes better at predicting

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 what you're going to do.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Yep.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 I love counter-intuitive.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 It's terrifying.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 Yeah, brilliant.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 But we've been that it's such a simple game.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 Well, remember how chickens could beat you in knots and crosses?

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 Yeah.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 Sorry, everyone, not just me.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 So you would be able to get these machines.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 They had one at Coney Island in America, and they were in other places as well.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 And basically, in knots and crosses, as long as you don't make any mistakes,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 no one can beat you.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 It's been solved, the game's been solved.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 And so they just taught these chickens to peck into the right places.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 So if there was a knot there, they taught it to put a cross in the next place and whatever.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 And it became impossible to beat them.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 So it became impossible to beat chickens at knots and crosses.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 It's so annoying.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 I know, it's so annoying.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 I can beat the chicken in so much.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Name it.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 Chess.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 Boggle.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Can I just quickly mention something about Spotify?

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Because, yeah, Spotify is obviously really amongst musicians.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 They hate Spotify because the royalty system that Spotify give is just terrible.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 And I think it's actually changed now.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 I think money is getting better with royalty payments with Spotify.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 But there was this great case.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 I read about a band that decided to beat the Spotify system to make money off them.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 They released an album.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 This was in March 2014.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 It was a funk band called VaultPack.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 And they put up an album called Sleepify.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 And Sleepify was a completely silent album.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 It was about 10 tracks.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 First one was called Zed.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 Second was Zed.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 All silent tracks.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 And they encouraged people to just stream it on a loop while they were going to sleep.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 So that they would get the numbers of counts.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 And they ended up raising $20,000 for their tour.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 And the best bit about it was everyone was like, did Spotify actually pay it out to them?

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Because Spotify took the album down after a while saying that you're cheating the system here.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 So they released a statement saying they did, in fact, pay us.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 But the statement they released was an audio track on Spotify.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 For people to listen to.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 That's great.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 I was just going to talk about improbable maths and probability.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 Does that sound fun?

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 Yes.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 From the people who brought you my favorite table.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 So that was my favorite physical table.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 My favorite mathematical table.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 So why I was so lucky?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 Yeah, because this fact is kind of about things that don't seem like they should be right to the human brain, but they are.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 So the fact that if there are 23 people in a room, what's the probability that two people have the same birthday?

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 And what is it?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 50%.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Yeah.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Which is really unlikely, right?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 You don't think that's going to be the case.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 And so the Monte Hall problem is quite a good example of counter-intuitive probability.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 So in short, it's basically where probably some of you know it.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 If you're given three doors, and there's stuff behind each door, and there's a goat behind two of the doors,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 and behind the third door there's a car.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 Imagine that you want the car.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 Not the goat.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 Which I've always thought was a serious problem with a Monte Hall problem.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 How do you do?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 I've got the car.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 One and three.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 You're my boy.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 So the Monte Hall problem presumes that you want the car.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 And it's that you pick a door.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 Am I trying this on that?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 So you've got three doors.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 You've picked a door.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 You haven't opened it.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 And then I open one of the doors that you didn't pick, and there's a goat behind it.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 And then I say, there's a goat behind this door.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 Do you want to switch your choice, or do you want the thing that's behind your original choice of door?

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 OK, so the idea is that you switch that height.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 Exactly.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 You switch, because there's a 2/3 chance that you're going to get that if you switch, you'll be right.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 Where there's a 1/3 chance that you'll be right, if you don't switch.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 And it feels counterintuitive, because it really feels like there must be the same probability that my door will be right as there was at the start of the day.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 It feels like it should be 50/50, right?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 Yeah.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 But when this was popularized this theory by this woman, Marilyn Savon, who had, I think she had the Guinness World Record for the highest IQ and bizarrely,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 she had the name Savon in both of her mother and her dad's family line, as in no at all, Savon.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 No.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 Yeah, it's no weird.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 So she, someone wrote into her column saying, can you tell me which is the right door to pick?

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 And she wrote the answer saying, you should switch your choice, because there's a 2/3 chance that you'll be right, if you switch your choice.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 And she got something like 10,000 letters from a thousand of which are from PhD students, or people with PhD saying, you're wrong.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 You're completely wrong.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 You're an idiot. How dare you say this.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 And she was just inundated with letters saying, and it's quite a basic concept.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 You should have given three addresses.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 Right.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 Anyway, I think, sorry, I think my whole point was pigeons are better than we are at solving that problem.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 So they tried the Monty Hall problem on pigeons, and they got them to like, peck a certain door, and then each day it was done over a month.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 And each day they were told to peck a certain door, and they would learn gradually.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 How do we know whether pigeons prefer goats or cows?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 Such a good point.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 We need to move on to our final facts.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Can I read quickly just on seeing patterns where you shouldn't see them. So things like spotting faces, which is called Paradeolia, where you see a face in a cloud or a wall.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 This goes back centuries.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 And just a couple of examples of this thing, Paradeolia.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 In 2012, somebody sold for, I think, $8,000 a chicken nugget shaped like George Washington.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 And it's a bit like George Washington.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 But only because it prays on the ability to see patterns that will work. Yeah, but there's only so much like George Washington that a chicken nugget can get in there.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 It's never going to be a great commander in chief.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 I mean, Paradeolia is very quiet today.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 Okay, this is...

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 Oh, yeah, come on.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 We do need to move on.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Let's see.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 One very last thing.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 Yeah.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 In 2013, a US department store sold out of a kettle after people noticed that it looked like Hitler.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 It had a handle, which is a black handle, and it had a little extra bumpy bit, and it looked like his hairstyle.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 And it just, it's uncanny.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 But the company denied knowledge of it, and they wrote a public statement saying,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 "If we had designed it to look like something, we would have gone with a snowman."

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 Or something fun.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 [Laughter]

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 All right, time to move on to our final fact of the show.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 And that is Chazinski.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 My fact is that the animal kingdom forgot how to have sex for 40 million years.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 So...

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 Justify that claim, Chazinski.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 The first known creature to have sex was Microbracchia's Dickey,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 which was a nice bit of normative determinism there.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 And that was 385 million years ago.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 It was a kind of fish.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 It was the first thing to copulate internally.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 So before that, people were just leaving eggs and sperm mining around the ocean.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 We've had this problem quite a few times.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 People is my catch all term for all creatures.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 Animals under sea prehistoric fish were leaving eggs and sperm around,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 which were just getting fertilised.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 Like that Microbracchia's Dickey did it 385 million years ago

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 and just didn't really catch on.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 40 million years.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 Animals decided they were going to stick with the whole egg sperm,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 leaving them in the water thing.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 And then 40 million years later, they weren't like it.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 Let's try this whole thing out.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 He went right after all.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 [Laughter]

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 But I've got a theory.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 So the way Dickey did it was, is it's like bony protrusions on his side.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 So they had sideways sex.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 Like one of the paleontologists who discovered it called it like square dancing sex.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 And so the bony protrusions of the male fish locked into the bony holes

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 in the female fish's side.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 Can I read, I know, exactly how they did it.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 Oh, everyone, please.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Okay.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 So the male had a large L-shaped sexual order.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 Nothing wrong with that.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 [Laughter]

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 Which he had to get into position to dock with the female's genital plates,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 which were very rough like cheese graters.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 They acted like Velcro locking the male organ into position so he could transfer sperm.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 He is very familiar.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 [Laughter]

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 And when you have sex, you should say this shag is brought to you by the letter L.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 [Laughter]

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 So yeah, maybe sideways isn't the way to do it.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 And then they started doing it differently and it got more popular.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 [Laughter]

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 And that's like, there's one dinosaur called the contrusaurus.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 And it's a dinosaur that we know how it's made up.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 We know how it looks.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 And the only thing we can't work out is how it had sex.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 They have no idea because every move that would be a normal dinosaur sex move

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 would end up in castration for the dinosaur.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 So no matter what position, and I imagine they sat there with toys going,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 "Oh, he's lost his balls again."

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 And we still don't know, it's a mystery.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 We have no idea how they had sex.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 And it's weird calling it doggy style because that's what they were saying when they predate dogs.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 Yeah.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 I just think we call it dinosaur style.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 Yeah, dinosaur style.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 Okay, my favourite thing about sexual positions, sorry about this.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 But it is funny.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 The gold swift moth has lots of different positions for having sex,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 but they all involve staying completely still,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 so as to avoid being noticed by bats.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Again, I can't tell you the number of times a bat has ruined another one.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 It's lovely evening.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 Just wait.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 The vision is based on movements.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 Sorry, just on a complete tangent.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 I found out a thing about bats the other day,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 which is some Mexican free-tailed bats,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 there's a particular species of them, they use their sonar to jam other bats' sonar.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 So a bats going in to bite an insect or to see some prey.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 And another bat from the side will deliver this huge blast of sonar,

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 which completely knocks out the other one's systems.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 The insect gets away, and this second one has a bigger chance of getting in.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 Wow.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 How come is that?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 Anyway, sorry.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 In 2013, we found the fossil of two bugs stuck in there.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 And it's the oldest copulating fossil we've ever found.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 It's 160 million years old and they were in the missionary position.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 So the oldest sexual position we have is actually missionary.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 There was one really recent one.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 It was two turtles that were fossilised in Coitus.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 This was 47 million years ago when they were caught that way.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 And they were having sex near a lake when they were overcome by volcanic gases.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 And they died and then they sunk down and turned into fossils.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 And one of the researchers said,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 "Many animals enter a trance-like state when mating or laying eggs.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 And it's possible these turtles simply did not notice

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 that they were entering poisonous waters before it was too late."

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 So what a way to go.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 I always wondered how that happens, how you can get fossils of animals

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 that are biting each other or having sex.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 And then the sex one, it seems like they might just be in a trance and they don't notice.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 They're just so into it.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 Another thing that animals have forgotten how to do is stick insects.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 Keep forgetting how to fly.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 So stick insects develop wings hundreds of million years ago or hundreds of million years ago.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 And four times they've lost their wings again and I've had to re-evolve their wings.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 They keep just like, not weathering, isn't that weird?

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 Yeah, that's cool.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 The closest non-human ancestor of ours was called Australopithecus sediment.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 And according to the skeletons that we have,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 what it looks like is about two million years ago.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 They evolved how to walk on the ground.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 And then evolved back to go back into the trees again.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Wow.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 Yeah.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 Wait, hold on, so they came down from the trees?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 They came down and they became like a primate that walked on the ground.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 And then they went back into the trees and then lived back up in the trees for another, you know, 100,000 years.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 That's like the ground.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 I read a Douglas Adams book called Last Chance to See.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 And he talks about the, what's the Kakapo in New Zealand?

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Kakapo basically was a bird that flew.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 Yeah.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 And then New Zealand lost all of its land predators.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 So it just came down to the ground and hung out and just spent time on the ground.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 It basically eventually lost the ability to fly.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 Yeah.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 But it didn't know that.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 And so there was a big thing where they were going extinct because Kakapo's kept climbing trees just going for a quick fly.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 And they'd jump off and they would just plummet to the ground.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 Then they didn't know.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 And they didn't like, say to each other, maybe we can't do this anymore.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 They just would have to do it.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 Well, they know ones who, I might be wrong about this, but were they the ones who were like quite naive when humans came.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 And they didn't realise that we were just going to kill them.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 Like we do with all animals.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 And so they would just walk along.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 And if a human came up to them, they wouldn't run away.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 They just sort of stand there.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 And then people just bonked them on the head and they'd die.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 And then they were also quite curious birds.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 And so the next one would come along going, no, what happens to Jeff?

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 And he'd walk around.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 And then just walk up to Jeff and then he'd get bonked on the head.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 And the next one would come and they just died out.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 And then the next one was like, fuck that.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 Let's fly out of here.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 Another thing about him, that Douglas Adams said,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 is that they have a mating call, which the male does, which is really boomy and basic.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 And they're just going, I don't know if that's ever.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 And so the thing is, is that he describes it as like being a subwoofer,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 like a real, in the back of a car.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 And the problem with that is that that sound doesn't appear from a location.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 And it appears all around you.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 That's the base kind of just appears everywhere.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 So the female's going, where the hell is this guy?

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 They can never find the male.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 And so they ended up not having a lot of sex because the female loses.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 Come here.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 Where?

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 Here.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 Yeah, that's not a good evolving.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 They've evolved very badly.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 Speaking of a long time ago, things coming down from the trees.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 Oh yeah.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 That's really pithicus.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 There is a theory that we developed by beetleism to allow men to show off their larger penises.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 Because men, or everyone listening to this, has a very large penis.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 Everyone, all men.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 No, that's all men.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 And men.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 I'm always wondered what that was.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 Compared with all other privates, human penises are large.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 So the erect guerrilla penis is three centimetres long.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 The chimpanzee is eight centimetres.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 So there is a theory that, I mean, it's not a widely subscribed to theory

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 that we develop walking upright, so men could show off.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 Just so you know, we're going to have to wrap up.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 Any last comments?

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 I'll have an odd animal mating weird thing.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 So the green spoon worm.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 Do you know about this guy?

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 No.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 When a green spoon worm is born, it doesn't have sex.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 Swins around the sea looking for a roving tongue of a female.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 But so it's an organism, right?

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 It might be it's not neither male nor female.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 And it swims around looking for the tongue of a female.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 If it doesn't find it, he becomes female and then has the tongue thing.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 And if he does, he becomes male, crawls through the female's mouth into her ovary

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 and becomes a sperm-producing machine.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 And he feeds through his skin because his mouth is constantly spewing out sperm.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 I mean, I think sperm-producing machine is a valid description of the male of most species.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 Another one I was like, we need to wrap up, James is like, no, not yet.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 We do need a wrap up, okay.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 I like, so there's a kind of strider bug or Jesus bug,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 which is one of those ones that runs along water,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 which the women don't really like animals.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 Female females.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 The female people don't really like copulating,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 because they usually fertilize the first time they copulate.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 So they only want to do every couple of months, whereas the men want to do it constantly.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 And it's like often attention in the animal kingdom is that men want to have sex lose

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 to like give you their sperm, but women, once they're first,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 but I say don't want to have sex.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 So anyway, the men or the male strider bugs as they're sometimes known.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 How developed these like protrusions on their legs where they can grab a woman's eyeball?

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 So he grabs the female's eyeball and like clutches,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 and they're specially designed now, the front legs of this strider bug,

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 to get around the eyeball, pull her to you, and then...

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 That's like, I really caught her eye.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 Not quite as romantic any more, guys.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.000

 Well, thanks so much, guys. Thanks for coming.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 We're going to be up in the bar now, just drinking and hanging out.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 So if you want to do that, if you want to let us...

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 Because this is our first one here, and we've got five more.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 Let us know if that was shit or if it was fun.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 And what we can do, difference.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 Yeah, very true. We can still cancel the other five.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 But now we better get out of here. Thank you very much, everyone.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 Thank you very much.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 [Applause]
