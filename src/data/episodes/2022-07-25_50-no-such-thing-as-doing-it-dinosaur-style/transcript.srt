00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 [APPLAUSE]

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 >> And welcome to another episode of No Stop Sinners of Fish.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 A weekly podcast this week coming to you from the Soho Theater in Central London.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 My name is Dan Shriver.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 I'm sitting here with the three regular elves.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 It's James Harkin, Andy Murray, and Anna Chazinski.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 And once again, we've got around the microphone with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 And in no particular order, here we go.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 James.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 >> Okay.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 My fact this week is that the 2012 law prohibiting nudity in San Francisco was proposed by a politician called Scott Wiener.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 [LAUGHTER]

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Keeping it high, Brown.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 >> Yeah.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 [LAUGHTER]

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 >> Yeah.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Just like I just like funny names, really.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 >> Yeah, that's my favorite thing.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 It's also it's that nominative determinism thing, isn't it?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 >> Yeah.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 >> We've actually met the person who coined nominative determinism.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 >> Really?

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 >> Yes, it's Mr. Determinism.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 >> Yes, Mr. Determinism.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 [LAUGHTER]

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 >> No, it's a British guy called John Hoyland.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Sadly, he passed away last year.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 But he used to write for new sciences, and he coined it.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And he coined it because he saw on the same day two things when he was out in the shops.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 The first thing was he saw a book that had come out on the Arctic by a Mr. Snowman.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 [LAUGHTER]

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 And in that very same day, he read a scientific paper on incontinence by J. W. Splatt.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 [LAUGHTER]

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And D. Weedon.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 [LAUGHTER]

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 >> Weedon and Splatt.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 It's quite a famous paper, that is.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 >> Is it?

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 >> Yeah.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 >> Wait, Mr. Snowman.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 >> Yeah, Mr. Snowman.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 >> Is that a name?

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Does anyone here know anyone called Snowman?

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I don't think it's it.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 How can it be a name?

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 [LAUGHTER]

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And he often denies the existence of people introduced to him if he doesn't agree with their name.

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 [LAUGHTER]

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 So after finding this guy called Scott Weiner, I tried to look for other political names in America,

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 funny ones, and good old BuzzFeed has one.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 It has a list of the 31 weirdest political names, and I want to give you a few of those.

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 So the former House representative from New Hampshire called Dick Sweat.

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 [LAUGHTER]

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Precinct committeeman from Arizona Frank Schmuck.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 This is my favourite one, it's not rude, but Butch Otter, who was the current covener of Idaho.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 But Butch Otter is such a good name, that's it.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I'd vote for Butch Otter.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 [LAUGHTER]

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 And there was Anthony Weiner, wasn't there?

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 I mean, you know, who'd flash people via text or something a couple of years ago?

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Oh, yeah, that was right.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 That was Anthony Weiner.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 It was, yeah.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I'd never thought about how technology has sort of made the flashing immunity way more

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 than the relaxing stay at home.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Usually it was really hands-on, wasn't it?

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 You had to go out of the street.

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Yeah, hands-on.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Actually hands-on was a whole different crime.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 [LAUGHTER]

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 What do we think of, so sort of the reverse thing, which is popular among celebrities now,

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 naming your child after where they were conceived or after something that's significant to them?

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Which goes back longer than I thought.

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 So Brooklyn Beckham.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Brooklyn Beckham, yeah, I think.

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And so in 1863, a boy was born and he was named Leicester Railway.

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 [LAUGHTER]

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 He was born at Leicester train station.

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Oh, I get born.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Born, born.

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Yeah.

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 [LAUGHTER]

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 But Rojard Kippling is named after the place where his parents either met or conceived him.

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Rojard Leic, which is in Staffordshire, I think.

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Yeah.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 So my reasoning went through all the censuses from 1790 to 1930 finding all the funny names there.

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And there were some really good ones.

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Some of the best ones.

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 So parents, Mr and Mrs. Day, in 1899, named their son Time of.

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 [LAUGHTER]

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 1899.

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Yeah.

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 1899, time of day.

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Yeah.

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I didn't think people had that kind of sense of humour back then.

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I know, I know.

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And yeah, so also in the 19th century, they found I'm a hog.

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I'm a pig.

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 I'm a nut.

101
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And I'm a hooker.

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 [LAUGHTER]

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 I wish I'd guessed the name I'm a winter fashion eventually, as you can't say.

104
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I was snowman, would've been good.

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 [LAUGHTER]

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 So, okay.

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 So this guy, where is he banned?

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 New to see?

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 San Francisco.

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 So was it not banned there?

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Was that the first time he'd been banned in public?

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Yeah, yeah.

113
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Because it's not banned in all places.

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 It's not banned in the UK, for instance.

115
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 It's not allowed to go around naked as long as you don't deliberately cause harassment or alarm or distress.

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Yeah.

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I found out that so you can go to, you know, like youth camps in America.

118
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 There's now a youth summer camp that's a nudist camp.

119
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Because it was thought that, I guess, young teenagers didn't have enough opportunity to engage in nudism or whatever.

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 But there's a rule at this summer camp.

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 So I think there are three or four of them in, like, Florida, Texas, Arizona.

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 There's a rule that, on the occasions that you do wear clothing.

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 So occasionally, they'll be scenarios where you put on some clothes.

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 It's not allowed to be sexually alluring.

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 [LAUGHTER]

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 One of the first other guys to be arrested for--

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 I find for indecent exposure was-- this was in 1927.

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And can anyone guess the part of himself you revealed?

129
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 OK.

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 His bottom.

131
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 No, it was his chest.

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Oh, really?

133
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And some bathing just took his shirt off.

134
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And that was it.

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 He was-- he was fined and arrested.

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Yeah, and the magistrate said, I'm going to hold rightly or wrongly that to expose the upper part of your body is indecent.

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 I think it is highly likely to shock persons of ordinary sensibility.

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 [LAUGHTER]

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 I, in summer in London, I'm actually in a very nice--

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 [LAUGHTER]

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 There was speaking of Topless, there's a really weird story in 1842 where there was up for war because--

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 so this was reported in a northern newspaper.

143
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And it was that women who worked down mines were being photographed topless.

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And it turned-- it was all over the newspapers.

145
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And it turned out that women were working topless down mines because it was really, really hot.

146
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And I think it turned out it was only in one mine.

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 It was a hotwood mine in Barnsley.

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And there was suddenly this big campaign saying women shouldn't be working down mines because it was seen as indecent

149
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 that they were apparently being forced to be topless.

150
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 That's art.

151
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Oh, that's weird.

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 I was just reading today actually in Mongolia.

153
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 They have an annual sporting event called the Three Mumbly Sports.

154
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And one of them's wrestling and one of them's throwing something.

155
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And the wrestling one, it's only men.

156
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And the way that they find that out is they make sure that they wrestle topless so that you could tell the difference

157
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 if there's a woman wrestling.

158
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Because they're very obvious other way of finding that out.

159
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Not like during a wrestling match, though.

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Oh yeah, what about that fact about Princess Anne was the only person not to be gender tested in the 19--

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Seven, two.

162
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Some Olympics, are they?

163
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 The Olympics, yeah.

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 She could be a man.

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Oh, nobody knows for sure.

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 She had not saying that Princess Anne is a man.

167
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Aniris.

168
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 We're just saying we can't rule it out.

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 So I was looking into nudity, which is extremely hard to do on the internet.

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 So hard.

171
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 The distractions available.

172
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 But I started looking into strip teeth because I suddenly thought,

173
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 "Oh, I don't know the history of strip teasing."

174
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 So that's hard to answer.

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 That's pretty weird.

176
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Every week.

177
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 But I'm surprised how far it goes back.

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 I mean, it goes back to, like, I think it was the 1700s.

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 And what's really weird is, is that they used to strip teas in front of--

180
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 it would be in a court, and you would be just having a fun night.

181
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And then the strip teas would start.

182
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And I always said that strip teas was accompanied by music.

183
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 While thinking the music back then wasn't exactly the sexiest.

184
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Yeah, when you got your harpsichord out.

185
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 There's not really a kind of sexy song to go with the strip teas.

186
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And then I read that.

187
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 A big thing that actually puts strip teasing around the world is more of an art form.

188
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 There was Gustav Flober.

189
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Flober.

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 He saw an Arab custom that he saw in Egypt, which was this dance.

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 It was the dance of the bee.

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Oh, is it the one where she takes off her clothes?

193
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Because she thinks she's got a bee inside her clothes.

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Yeah, again.

195
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Not very sexy, but what she's so--

196
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 It's just like--

197
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 It seems like strip teasing, like, slowly introduced the idea of sexuality much later in the day.

198
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 I think strip tease must go back further than that, though.

199
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Oh, yeah.

200
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Yeah.

201
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 If you Google nudity--

202
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Right.

203
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 And obviously, you have to be quite careful.

204
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 But the results that came up for me, you know the autocomplete options on Google,

205
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 were nudity in Far Cry 4, which is a computer game.

206
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 nudity crossword clue.

207
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 So when it's nudity in Dragon Age inquisition, not a computer game.

208
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 But then I realised these are tailored to me.

209
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 I don't own either of those games.

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Until now.

211
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 You wanted them, presumably.

212
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I wanted to see if there was any political parties who were up for nudity.

213
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 And so I googled the National nudity Party.

214
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 And I found only one here.

215
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 It was a Facebook page, and it had one like the National nudity Party.

216
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And it was a guy called Nenad Philopovitch from Serbia.

217
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Oh, yeah.

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 He's the only member of the Facebook National nudity Party.

219
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 It's not much of a party, isn't it?

220
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I mean, I--

221
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 I've had some really dead parties in my time, but that was bad.

222
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 The first ever nudist-- the first ever organised nudist movement was set up by just three people.

223
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 They were Englishmen living in Bombay in 1890.

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And they just like the dress codes of the British ranch, which are very, you know,

225
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 you had so much, and it was very hot.

226
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And so they established a group called The Fellowship of the Naked Trust.

227
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 And they began to meet together in the nude.

228
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 And they were the only three members that lasted for just two years.

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 And then they stopped.

230
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And I just-- I want to know what happened at least.

231
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 I presume nothing much happened at these meetings.

232
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Just three men--

233
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 There's something happened for it to start, didn't it?

234
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Someone stepped over a boundary, no?

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 I was looking into the history of clothing, because I thought--

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Apparently, for the majority of our time on Earth, we have been naked.

237
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 String, apparently, is what changed everything.

238
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 The invention of string, because it meant you could harness--

239
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 You know, it really could be harness.

240
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 So string was really hard to make.

241
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 So they ended up-- they used hemp.

242
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Hemp was the big thing that would, you know, you could put into small strips.

243
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 You could wear it in larger patches.

244
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And the thing about hemp was it was going really well.

245
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And everyone was using it.

246
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 And then suddenly they discovered that you could smoke hemp.

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 You get really high.

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And then they all got naked again.

249
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Yeah, exactly.

250
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Stoned off their asses.

251
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 The ass of hemp turned into a high as a result of clothing.

252
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 The other thing is that in the early American times,

253
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 they used hemp for their ships as well.

254
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And they needed the hemp.

255
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 And no one really wanted to grow it.

256
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 They all wanted to grow food, because you got more money.

257
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 But so one of the first-- in fact, it was the first ever drug law in America

258
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 was to make it that you had to grow hemp.

259
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Yeah.

260
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 I just read in my notes.

261
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 I've actually misspelled this when I was writing about nudity

262
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 and a surge in nude crises.

263
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 And I actually meant to write cruises, which I have been a surge in.

264
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Which is not a crisis.

265
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 But they have been a surge in nude cruises.

266
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And also the first new charted flight by a German air--

267
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 German to this company yet.

268
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 You know, in Germany, so I haven't been to beaches in Germany.

269
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 So this is just what I've read.

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 But most beaches are named.

271
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 You'll have signs on the beaches.

272
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 FKK is one sign.

273
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And that points to Freikorper Culfer, which is a free body culture.

274
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And that's the naked part.

275
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 And then you have the one that's called the textile beach.

276
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Which really does sound like the losers beach.

277
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 The knitting beach.

278
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Do you know about German agricultural nudist traditions?

279
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 They're good.

280
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Try me.

281
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 OK.

282
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 So lots of different bits of Germany have nudity related customs

283
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 to encourage the crops and the harvest.

284
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 So, for example, in Salfeldt,

285
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 a woman would walk around the Flaxfields naked

286
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 on a particular night of the year.

287
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 And in the eight-- this went until the 19th century

288
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 where women in Rydlingen would walk naked

289
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 and urinate in the Flaxfields, urging the crops to grow

290
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 as high as their breasts.

291
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And men did the same thing as well.

292
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Men would walk around the sorps.

293
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 They would walk naked in the fields chanting, "Flax. Flax.

294
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Flax. Grow as high as the scrotum."

295
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 [LAUGHTER]

296
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 So, the men's crop is weren't growing as high.

297
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 [LAUGHTER]

298
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 All right.

299
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 We got to move on to our second fact.

300
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 So, time for fact number two.

301
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Fact number two is my fact.

302
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 My fact this week is that Charles Darwin's grandfather,

303
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Erasmus Darwin, got so large that he couldn't fit

304
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 at his dinner table anymore.

305
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Rather than going on an exercise regime,

306
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 he decided to cut a semi-circle in the table

307
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 so he could fit his stomach here and continue eating.

308
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 [LAUGHTER]

309
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 It's just wonderful decision-making.

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Yeah.

311
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 And that's an example of why he was such a genius, all right?

312
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Absolutely.

313
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Yeah, so he-- I mean, this is the thing.

314
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 I've never heard of Erasmus Darwin

315
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 because obviously his grandson, Charles,

316
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 really is dominating the cold inches.

317
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 But he was extraordinary.

318
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Yeah, but Erasmus Darwin was awesome.

319
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 He was as serious polymath, wasn't he?

320
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 He's like the epitome of polymath.

321
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 And he came up with loads of inventions, really cool inventions,

322
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 some of which actually did work.

323
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 So the steam car, very early person

324
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 to experiment with steam and create a steam-operated vehicle,

325
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 a wire-drawn, very horizontal windmill.

326
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 I don't know why that's useful for, but whatever.

327
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 No.

328
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 [LAUGHTER]

329
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Hey, who's experimenting?

330
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I know how windmill work.

331
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 There's more-- all right, go on.

332
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 [LAUGHTER]

333
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 I will.

334
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 An artificial bird.

335
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 And a magnetically-operated fake spider.

336
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 It's so really cool, like an early jute toy.

337
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

338
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 He also invented-- he came up with an idea

339
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 of using hydrogen balloons to increase the amount

340
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 that could be carried in wheelbarrows.

341
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 [LAUGHTER]

342
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 That's a good idea.

343
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 It's a good idea.

344
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 He sounds really clever.

345
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 But then I also read that he once tried

346
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 to cure a five-year-old boy's problem

347
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 with squinting by fixing a ginormous fake nose

348
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 to his face.

349
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And that was his solution.

350
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 He was like, this is definitely work.

351
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Just walk around.

352
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 This will be fine.

353
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Do you know if it worked?

354
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Well, no one noticed he's squinting anymore.

355
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 [LAUGHTER]

356
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 The thing about the balloons-- I just remembered, actually--

357
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Benjamin Franklin, he had a number of other ideas

358
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 for hydrogen balloons.

359
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 And one of them was that he would put his food,

360
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 attach his food to a hydrogen balloon,

361
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 and then he would let it go miles into the air

362
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 to keep it cool so you wouldn't need a refrigerator.

363
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And they would keep the food cool up there.

364
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And when you wanted it, you just shoot it down.

365
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 The food would come down, you could eat it, and it'd be cold.

366
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 That is much more convenient than a refrigerator.

367
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I'm amazed we're not all doing it.

368
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Apparently he was really attractive to women, though,

369
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 despite being so corpulent.

370
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 He sounds like a really charismatic guy.

371
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Women fancy to him.

372
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 He was a bit of a female magnet.

373
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 I think you have 16 children?

374
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Yeah.

375
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 12 of them legitimate to not.

376
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Yeah.

377
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Should have invented the condom.

378
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 [LAUGHTER]

379
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 But one of the cool things about him

380
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 is he kind of inspired Mary Shelley to write Frankenstein.

381
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 There it is.

382
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Yeah.

383
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 So when they were all Mary Shelley and Byron

384
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 and Percy Shelley, they were all staying in Lake Geneva

385
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 and they were telling each other ghost stories.

386
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 And Mary Shelley writes in her diary, she says,

387
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 "Byron and Shelley had a load of conversations

388
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 to which I was a devout, but nearly silent listener."

389
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 I eat, they were going on about it.

390
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 They talked with the experiments of Dr. Darwin,

391
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 who supposedly preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case.

392
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 What does vermicelli say?

393
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 It's a worm.

394
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 It means little worm.

395
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 It was a small worm, wasn't it?

396
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Well, I think it's pasta, because--

397
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 No, no.

398
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 No.

399
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And then he brought the pasta to life.

400
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 He brought the pasta to life.

401
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And I've missed research.

402
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 [LAUGHTER]

403
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 I was not useful for anyone.

404
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 That would have been a very thing with it.

405
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 I think it's still pasta.

406
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 It would have made a very different Frankenstein.

407
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 You just have to get lots of hot water over it,

408
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 and then you just go like this.

409
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 I think it was a worm, but whatever.

410
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 [LAUGHTER]

411
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 And he meant what you kind of came up with the theory of evolution,

412
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 for which Charles gets all the credit now.

413
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Yeah.

414
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 But he came up with lots of early iterations of the theory of evolution.

415
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Yeah, he didn't do natural selection, did he?

416
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 But he thought that everything came from something smaller,

417
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 something very, very-- like a very tiny piece of pasta.

418
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Yeah.

419
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Everything grew from there.

420
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 But he didn't realize survival of the fetus.

421
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 He didn't really have that.

422
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Just speaking of Charles Orwin, I read a thing about him,

423
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 which I really thought was extraordinary about the times.

424
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 So when he went on the Beagle trip, he wasn't the naturalist

425
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 on the Beagle trip.

426
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And actually, we went to-- three of us, I think,

427
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 went to the Welcome Institute that you can go to in London.

428
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And they have this kind of-- there's this behind-the-scenes area

429
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 where they have all these amazing documents

430
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 that no one sees in the public, one of which

431
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 is the diaries of the naturalist from the Beagle.

432
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And what's amazing about it is the naturalist spent more time

433
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 just going, who the fuck is this Darwin guy?

434
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 [LAUGHTER]

435
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And it's literally a bitch diary, the whole thing going on.

436
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 And he's talking about tortoises

437
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 and this theory of them-- it was so bitchy.

438
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 And they've never published it.

439
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 They really need to.

440
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 But Darwin almost didn't make it onto the Beagle

441
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 because Fitzroy, who was the captain,

442
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 didn't like the shape of his nose.

443
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Yeah.

444
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 He thought he believed in what was the theory that--

445
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Physiognomy.

446
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Physiognomy, yeah.

447
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Which meant that you could tell someone's personality

448
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 by their physical traits.

449
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And he thought it meant Darwin was arrogant and stubborn.

450
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 It was just a theory in those days that you could tell

451
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 if someone's personality by the shape of their face

452
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 or you would have people who looked a bit like criminal or so.

453
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And actually, it's dated back all the way back to Roman times.

454
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 And also, I mean, we say their eyes are too close together.

455
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 I mean, it remains today.

456
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 We do make judgements based on people's physical characteristics.

457
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 I do.

458
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 [LAUGHTER]

459
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Never trusted you.

460
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 [LAUGHTER]

461
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 This is quite funny, but if we don't want Darwin's family,

462
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 so Darwin married his cousin, which is quite well known.

463
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 But I like the fact that one of his sons called George

464
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 became an academic and one of the only academic papers

465
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 that we know about that existed that was published--

466
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 was published in the Journal of the Statistical Society.

467
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 And it was titled "Marriages Between First Cousins in England

468
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 and Their Effects."

469
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 [LAUGHTER]

470
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 So he was both the author and the subjects of that--

471
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Yep.

472
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 He wanted Parliament to add at Charles Darwin,

473
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 this is, wanted Parliament to add a question to the census.

474
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 They did.

475
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Saying, are you married to your first cousin?

476
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Have you noticed anything going wrong?

477
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 [LAUGHTER]

478
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 And they wouldn't do it.

479
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 They wouldn't allow him to add that question to the census.

480
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 They said it was too personal.

481
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 I read a sentence about Charles Darwin,

482
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 and I know nothing more about it because I just saw,

483
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 I don't want to go further than this.

484
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 The sentence was, Charles Darwin hated religious controversy

485
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 because it exacerbated his bowel problems.

486
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 [LAUGHTER]

487
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Please, Charles, with mine.

488
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 [LAUGHTER]

489
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Well, Erasmus Darwin, just going back to him,

490
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 he got in a lot of trouble because he didn't believe

491
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 in the Judeo-Christianic God.

492
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 He still believed in God, but just not the main one.

493
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And he believed in, like, some kind of distant entity.

494
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And I think he changed his-- because he believed in evolution,

495
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 he changed his family crest to everything from shells

496
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 or something like that.

497
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 He put those words on it, yeah.

498
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 He was wrong.

499
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 He was wrong.

500
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Well, in the specifics, yes.

501
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 But in the general thrust, no.

502
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Yeah.

503
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Just going back to his inventions as well,

504
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 he invented a circulating swing to cure madness.

505
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 It's a spinning thing.

506
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 You put a person who's got mental issues back in the day.

507
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 They have one at Bedlam.

508
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 You would put them in this machine.

509
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 It would spin them around, make them feel nauseous.

510
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 They would vomit, lose control of their bladder and bowels,

511
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 some blood from the nose and ears,

512
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 some had convulsions and many passed out.

513
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Then he stopped the machine as suddenly as he could,

514
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 and this invariably had a calming effect

515
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 subduing even the most violent patience.

516
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 So what?

517
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Do you still feel angry?

518
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 You see, you're saying nothing.

519
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Your fact was about tables, right?

520
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Yes.

521
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 I don't know.

522
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 It feels like a long time ago now.

523
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 So my favourite table, I think, is a table.

524
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 We've all got one.

525
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Welcome to my favourite table.

526
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 It's my spin-off show, one episode.

527
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 It was Louis the 16th,

528
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 and it was in his château at Choisy,

529
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 which I'm guessing is somewhere in France,

530
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 and it was his table of volunt,

531
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 and it was because he got annoyed at the fact that between courses,

532
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 the servants would have to come and bring you your food,

533
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 so they would have to take away your plates

534
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 and bring you your main course up to your starter.

535
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And he thought, "This is really disruptive."

536
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 So what he may have in what?

537
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 He cut a huge hole around the dining room table,

538
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 and he had it lowered into the servant's quarters between courses,

539
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 so the servants down below could stock it up,

540
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 and then raise it back up to their level,

541
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 which apparently was less disruptive than everything.

542
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Was he friends with Benjamin Franklin by any chance?

543
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 That's a good table.

544
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 That's a good one to start the series, I think.

545
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 I think it is, yeah.

546
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 A few carpulent people.

547
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Yeah. Daniel Lambert, he was the fattest man ever when he was alive,

548
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 weighed 318 kilograms.

549
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 He was the heaviest man in history,

550
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 but John Brower, who died in 1983,

551
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 he weighed over 635 kilograms.

552
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 So even though this guy was the biggest at the time,

553
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 we've gone twice as big now.

554
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 And Lambert was so fat, apparently, that he couldn't sink.

555
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 He was now.

556
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 I'm not sure how that works.

557
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 There's something with that.

558
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 And he was from Leicester,

559
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 and he would float along the river's tower,

560
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 allowing children to hitch a lift on his own.

561
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 It was a more innocent time.

562
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 He was really strong.

563
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 He once fought a bear in the streets of Leicester.

564
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Why was a bear in the streets of Leicester?

565
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 I don't know, but you've got to be glad that he's there when it happens.

566
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 He gets out of the water.

567
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Get down.

568
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Sorry, kids.

569
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 You've got to find a bear.

570
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 And then he got so famous,

571
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 and he exhibited himself in a house in Piccadilly in London,

572
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 and people would go and pay to chat to him,

573
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 because apparently he's quite a raccoon to her as well.

574
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 And at the same time as he was exhibiting himself in Piccadilly,

575
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 down the road on Sackville Street,

576
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 there was a fat baby known as Master Wybrance,

577
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Mr. Lumber's in miniature.

578
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 How many people would go to see this fat baby?

579
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Just while they were there.

580
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 It's like if they could get a ticket for Lumber, they'd go and see either.

581
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Like the fringe.

582
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 It was a fringe event.

583
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Exactly.

584
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Yeah.

585
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Surely they did a double act.

586
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Yeah, they should have done, shouldn't they?

587
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 It's in our theory why humans have put on weight

588
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 in the last couple of centuries,

589
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 as well as all the dietary change.

590
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 But another theory is that humans all used to weigh less,

591
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 and this is hundreds and thousands of years ago,

592
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 because they were constantly exposed to infections

593
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 and infected with stuff.

594
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And when you're infected, when you're fighting an infection,

595
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 your body warms up and you burn calories for more of them.

596
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 I know.

597
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 So that's the answer is to just constantly be ill.

598
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Well, people think that though obesity might be infectious,

599
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 and I like this because it's a good excuse for obesity.

600
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 But yeah, there's this theory.

601
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 They've tried it on mice where they've implanted bacteria

602
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 from obese humans into a mouse guts.

603
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And then they took another bunch of mice and implanted bacteria

604
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 from like normal weight humans into different mouse guts.

605
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And the mouse guts with the bacteria from the fat humans got fat.

606
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And then and the mouse got mice with the bacteria

607
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 from the not fat humans didn't get fat.

608
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 And then when they put all the mice together,

609
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 the thin mice were infected with the fat mouse bacteria,

610
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 and they all got fat.

611
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 So they think the fatness might be infectious caused by bacteria in your stomach,

612
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 which I don't believe, but you would like to.

613
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Guys, we've got to move on to our next fact.

614
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Time is against it.

615
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Okay, time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

616
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 My fact is that Spotify's random function is not random.

617
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 It used to be random.

618
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 It used to play any random song,

619
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 but then human listeners kept inferring order and seeing patterns

620
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 where there weren't any patterns.

621
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 So now they've had to change the algorithm,

622
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 so it's structured, but in such a way that human listeners think that it's random.

623
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Can I just ask quickly, who were the non-human listeners?

624
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 That's amazing.

625
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 So we see patterns in the algorithm.

626
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 It's not there.

627
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And so they had to create a fake one.

628
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Yeah.

629
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 So if you've got five different genres of music in a normal, completely random pattern,

630
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 occasionally you get clumps or clusters,

631
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 where it would play two or three jazz songs in the same consecutively,

632
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 and they've had to change it.

633
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 So it now completely mixes up the genres.

634
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 So yeah, they've had to abandon actual randomness.

635
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Or it doesn't completely mix up the genres.

636
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Even spread the mouse out to proper intervals.

637
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Yeah, exactly.

638
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Yeah.

639
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Because people don't believe.

640
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Yeah.

641
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Because people just can't kind of figure out randomness.

642
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Humans can't really come.

643
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 If you ask everyone in this room to stand randomly somewhere in the room,

644
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 then they'll all spread out pretty much equally.

645
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Yeah.

646
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Well, actually in real life, there'd be clumps everywhere.

647
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Yeah.

648
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 But don't do that, guys.

649
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 No.

650
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 It's the gambler's fallacy, isn't it?

651
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 It's the thing that makes gamblers think that if they've been 20 reds in a row on a roulette machine,

652
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 it's because the 21st is going to be not a red, and it's just not true.

653
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 I think the first instance, so the first time I was reported and studied within 1913 when a roulette ball fell on black 26 times in a row,

654
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 and all gamblers are going, "Come on, it's not possible. It can't do it again."

655
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Yeah, I also think that's not possible.

656
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 That's amazing, isn't it?

657
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 One thing they didn't say is that on that roulette wheel, there'd been a mistake with the order

658
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 of the work experience boy painted them all black.

659
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Yeah.

660
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 You're actually going to change the back.

661
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 So if you get someone to put a random list of 30 coin flips, say,

662
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 and I actually flip the coin 30 times, and you do a random number, like HT, HT, whatever,

663
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 you'll be able to tell which is the manmade one just by looking at it.

664
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And that's because--

665
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Because even--

666
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Yeah, because most, if you do 30, you're likely to get about 5 in a row which are either heads or tails,

667
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 but no human would do that.

668
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Yeah, it seems impossible.

669
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Yeah, so it used to be a machine you could get called an out-guessing machine,

670
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 and they had those in America, I think it was in the 50s,

671
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 and you would have to choose either left or right.

672
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 You would say left, and the machine would have to guess whether you said left or right.

673
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 And then you would keep doing that, and eventually it would guess almost every time,

674
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 because humans just go into a pattern.

675
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Yeah, it's like what paper scissors on the New York Times.

676
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 You can play rock paper scissors, can't you?

677
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 And it's the same thing.

678
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And the game learns, as it plays against you, what your patterns are.

679
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 So the more you play it, the less like you are to win it, because it becomes better at predicting

680
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 what you're going to do.

681
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Yep.

682
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 I love counter-intuitive.

683
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 It's terrifying.

684
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Yeah, brilliant.

685
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 But we've been that it's such a simple game.

686
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Well, remember how chickens could beat you in knots and crosses?

687
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Yeah.

688
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Sorry, everyone, not just me.

689
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 So you would be able to get these machines.

690
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 They had one at Coney Island in America, and they were in other places as well.

691
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And basically, in knots and crosses, as long as you don't make any mistakes,

692
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 no one can beat you.

693
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 It's been solved, the game's been solved.

694
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And so they just taught these chickens to peck into the right places.

695
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 So if there was a knot there, they taught it to put a cross in the next place and whatever.

696
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And it became impossible to beat them.

697
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 So it became impossible to beat chickens at knots and crosses.

698
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 It's so annoying.

699
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 I know, it's so annoying.

700
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 I can beat the chicken in so much.

701
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Name it.

702
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Chess.

703
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Boggle.

704
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 Can I just quickly mention something about Spotify?

705
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Because, yeah, Spotify is obviously really amongst musicians.

706
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 They hate Spotify because the royalty system that Spotify give is just terrible.

707
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 And I think it's actually changed now.

708
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 I think money is getting better with royalty payments with Spotify.

709
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 But there was this great case.

710
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 I read about a band that decided to beat the Spotify system to make money off them.

711
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 They released an album.

712
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 This was in March 2014.

713
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 It was a funk band called VaultPack.

714
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And they put up an album called Sleepify.

715
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 And Sleepify was a completely silent album.

716
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 It was about 10 tracks.

717
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 First one was called Zed.

718
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Second was Zed.

719
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 All silent tracks.

720
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And they encouraged people to just stream it on a loop while they were going to sleep.

721
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 So that they would get the numbers of counts.

722
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And they ended up raising $20,000 for their tour.

723
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 And the best bit about it was everyone was like, did Spotify actually pay it out to them?

724
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Because Spotify took the album down after a while saying that you're cheating the system here.

725
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 So they released a statement saying they did, in fact, pay us.

726
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 But the statement they released was an audio track on Spotify.

727
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 [LAUGHTER]

728
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 For people to listen to.

729
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 That's great.

730
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 I was just going to talk about improbable maths and probability.

731
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Does that sound fun?

732
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Yes.

733
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 [LAUGHTER]

734
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 From the people who brought you my favorite table.

735
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 [LAUGHTER]

736
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 So that was my favorite physical table.

737
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 My favorite mathematical table.

738
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 [LAUGHTER]

739
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 [LAUGHTER]

740
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 So why I was so lucky?

741
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Yeah, because this fact is kind of about things that don't seem like they should be right to the human brain, but they are.

742
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 So the fact that if there are 23 people in a room, what's the probability that two people have the same birthday?

743
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And what is it?

744
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 50%.

745
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Yeah.

746
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Which is really unlikely, right?

747
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 You don't think that's going to be the case.

748
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 And so the Monte Hall problem is quite a good example of counter-intuitive probability.

749
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 So in short, it's basically where probably some of you know it.

750
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 If you're given three doors, and there's stuff behind each door, and there's a goat behind two of the doors,

751
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 and behind the third door there's a car.

752
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Imagine that you want the car.

753
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Not the goat.

754
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Which I've always thought was a serious problem with a Monte Hall problem.

755
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 How do you do?

756
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 I've got the car.

757
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 [LAUGHTER]

758
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 One and three.

759
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 [LAUGHTER]

760
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 You're my boy.

761
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 [LAUGHTER]

762
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 So the Monte Hall problem presumes that you want the car.

763
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 And it's that you pick a door.

764
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Am I trying this on that?

765
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 So you've got three doors.

766
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 You've picked a door.

767
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 You haven't opened it.

768
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 And then I open one of the doors that you didn't pick, and there's a goat behind it.

769
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 And then I say, there's a goat behind this door.

770
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Do you want to switch your choice, or do you want the thing that's behind your original choice of door?

771
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 OK, so the idea is that you switch that height.

772
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Exactly.

773
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 You switch, because there's a 2/3 chance that you're going to get that if you switch, you'll be right.

774
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Where there's a 1/3 chance that you'll be right, if you don't switch.

775
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 And it feels counterintuitive, because it really feels like there must be the same probability that my door will be right as there was at the start of the day.

776
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 It feels like it should be 50/50, right?

777
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Yeah.

778
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 But when this was popularized this theory by this woman, Marilyn Savon, who had, I think she had the Guinness World Record for the highest IQ and bizarrely,

779
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 she had the name Savon in both of her mother and her dad's family line, as in no at all, Savon.

780
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 No.

781
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Yeah, it's no weird.

782
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 So she, someone wrote into her column saying, can you tell me which is the right door to pick?

783
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 And she wrote the answer saying, you should switch your choice, because there's a 2/3 chance that you'll be right, if you switch your choice.

784
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 And she got something like 10,000 letters from a thousand of which are from PhD students, or people with PhD saying, you're wrong.

785
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 You're completely wrong.

786
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 You're an idiot. How dare you say this.

787
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 And she was just inundated with letters saying, and it's quite a basic concept.

788
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 You should have given three addresses.

789
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Right.

790
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Anyway, I think, sorry, I think my whole point was pigeons are better than we are at solving that problem.

791
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 So they tried the Monty Hall problem on pigeons, and they got them to like, peck a certain door, and then each day it was done over a month.

792
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And each day they were told to peck a certain door, and they would learn gradually.

793
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 How do we know whether pigeons prefer goats or cows?

794
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Such a good point.

795
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 We need to move on to our final facts.

796
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Can I read quickly just on seeing patterns where you shouldn't see them. So things like spotting faces, which is called Paradeolia, where you see a face in a cloud or a wall.

797
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 This goes back centuries.

798
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 And just a couple of examples of this thing, Paradeolia.

799
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 In 2012, somebody sold for, I think, $8,000 a chicken nugget shaped like George Washington.

800
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 And it's a bit like George Washington.

801
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 But only because it prays on the ability to see patterns that will work. Yeah, but there's only so much like George Washington that a chicken nugget can get in there.

802
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 It's never going to be a great commander in chief.

803
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 I mean, Paradeolia is very quiet today.

804
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Okay, this is...

805
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Oh, yeah, come on.

806
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 We do need to move on.

807
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Let's see.

808
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 One very last thing.

809
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Yeah.

810
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 In 2013, a US department store sold out of a kettle after people noticed that it looked like Hitler.

811
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 It had a handle, which is a black handle, and it had a little extra bumpy bit, and it looked like his hairstyle.

812
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 And it just, it's uncanny.

813
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 But the company denied knowledge of it, and they wrote a public statement saying,

814
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 "If we had designed it to look like something, we would have gone with a snowman."

815
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Or something fun.

816
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 [Laughter]

817
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 All right, time to move on to our final fact of the show.

818
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 And that is Chazinski.

819
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 My fact is that the animal kingdom forgot how to have sex for 40 million years.

820
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 So...

821
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Justify that claim, Chazinski.

822
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 The first known creature to have sex was Microbracchia's Dickey,

823
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 which was a nice bit of normative determinism there.

824
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 And that was 385 million years ago.

825
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 It was a kind of fish.

826
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 It was the first thing to copulate internally.

827
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 So before that, people were just leaving eggs and sperm mining around the ocean.

828
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 We've had this problem quite a few times.

829
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 People is my catch all term for all creatures.

830
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Animals under sea prehistoric fish were leaving eggs and sperm around,

831
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 which were just getting fertilised.

832
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Like that Microbracchia's Dickey did it 385 million years ago

833
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 and just didn't really catch on.

834
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 40 million years.

835
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Animals decided they were going to stick with the whole egg sperm,

836
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 leaving them in the water thing.

837
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 And then 40 million years later, they weren't like it.

838
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Let's try this whole thing out.

839
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 He went right after all.

840
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 [Laughter]

841
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 But I've got a theory.

842
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 So the way Dickey did it was, is it's like bony protrusions on his side.

843
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 So they had sideways sex.

844
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Like one of the paleontologists who discovered it called it like square dancing sex.

845
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 And so the bony protrusions of the male fish locked into the bony holes

846
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 in the female fish's side.

847
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Can I read, I know, exactly how they did it.

848
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Oh, everyone, please.

849
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Okay.

850
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 So the male had a large L-shaped sexual order.

851
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Nothing wrong with that.

852
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 [Laughter]

853
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Which he had to get into position to dock with the female's genital plates,

854
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 which were very rough like cheese graters.

855
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 They acted like Velcro locking the male organ into position so he could transfer sperm.

856
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 He is very familiar.

857
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 [Laughter]

858
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 And when you have sex, you should say this shag is brought to you by the letter L.

859
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 [Laughter]

860
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 So yeah, maybe sideways isn't the way to do it.

861
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 And then they started doing it differently and it got more popular.

862
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 [Laughter]

863
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 And that's like, there's one dinosaur called the contrusaurus.

864
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Oh, yeah.

865
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 And it's a dinosaur that we know how it's made up.

866
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 We know how it looks.

867
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 And the only thing we can't work out is how it had sex.

868
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 They have no idea because every move that would be a normal dinosaur sex move

869
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 would end up in castration for the dinosaur.

870
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 So no matter what position, and I imagine they sat there with toys going,

871
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 "Oh, he's lost his balls again."

872
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 And we still don't know, it's a mystery.

873
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 We have no idea how they had sex.

874
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 And it's weird calling it doggy style because that's what they were saying when they predate dogs.

875
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Yeah.

876
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 I just think we call it dinosaur style.

877
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Yeah, dinosaur style.

878
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Okay, my favourite thing about sexual positions, sorry about this.

879
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 But it is funny.

880
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 The gold swift moth has lots of different positions for having sex,

881
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 but they all involve staying completely still,

882
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 so as to avoid being noticed by bats.

883
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 Again, I can't tell you the number of times a bat has ruined another one.

884
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 It's lovely evening.

885
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 Just wait.

886
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 The vision is based on movements.

887
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Sorry, just on a complete tangent.

888
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 I found out a thing about bats the other day,

889
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 which is some Mexican free-tailed bats,

890
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 there's a particular species of them, they use their sonar to jam other bats' sonar.

891
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 So a bats going in to bite an insect or to see some prey.

892
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 And another bat from the side will deliver this huge blast of sonar,

893
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 which completely knocks out the other one's systems.

894
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 The insect gets away, and this second one has a bigger chance of getting in.

895
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Wow.

896
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 How come is that?

897
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 Anyway, sorry.

898
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 In 2013, we found the fossil of two bugs stuck in there.

899
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 And it's the oldest copulating fossil we've ever found.

900
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 It's 160 million years old and they were in the missionary position.

901
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 So the oldest sexual position we have is actually missionary.

902
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 There was one really recent one.

903
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 It was two turtles that were fossilised in Coitus.

904
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 This was 47 million years ago when they were caught that way.

905
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 And they were having sex near a lake when they were overcome by volcanic gases.

906
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 And they died and then they sunk down and turned into fossils.

907
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 And one of the researchers said,

908
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 "Many animals enter a trance-like state when mating or laying eggs.

909
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 And it's possible these turtles simply did not notice

910
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 that they were entering poisonous waters before it was too late."

911
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 So what a way to go.

912
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 I always wondered how that happens, how you can get fossils of animals

913
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 that are biting each other or having sex.

914
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 And then the sex one, it seems like they might just be in a trance and they don't notice.

915
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 They're just so into it.

916
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Another thing that animals have forgotten how to do is stick insects.

917
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Keep forgetting how to fly.

918
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 So stick insects develop wings hundreds of million years ago or hundreds of million years ago.

919
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 And four times they've lost their wings again and I've had to re-evolve their wings.

920
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 They keep just like, not weathering, isn't that weird?

921
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 Yeah, that's cool.

922
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 The closest non-human ancestor of ours was called Australopithecus sediment.

923
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 And according to the skeletons that we have,

924
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 what it looks like is about two million years ago.

925
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 They evolved how to walk on the ground.

926
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 And then evolved back to go back into the trees again.

927
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 Wow.

928
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 Yeah.

929
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Wait, hold on, so they came down from the trees?

930
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 They came down and they became like a primate that walked on the ground.

931
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 And then they went back into the trees and then lived back up in the trees for another, you know, 100,000 years.

932
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 That's like the ground.

933
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 I read a Douglas Adams book called Last Chance to See.

934
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 And he talks about the, what's the Kakapo in New Zealand?

935
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 Kakapo basically was a bird that flew.

936
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 Yeah.

937
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 And then New Zealand lost all of its land predators.

938
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 So it just came down to the ground and hung out and just spent time on the ground.

939
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 It basically eventually lost the ability to fly.

940
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 Yeah.

941
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 But it didn't know that.

942
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 And so there was a big thing where they were going extinct because Kakapo's kept climbing trees just going for a quick fly.

943
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 And they'd jump off and they would just plummet to the ground.

944
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 Then they didn't know.

945
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 And they didn't like, say to each other, maybe we can't do this anymore.

946
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 They just would have to do it.

947
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 Well, they know ones who, I might be wrong about this, but were they the ones who were like quite naive when humans came.

948
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 And they didn't realise that we were just going to kill them.

949
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 Like we do with all animals.

950
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 And so they would just walk along.

951
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 And if a human came up to them, they wouldn't run away.

952
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 They just sort of stand there.

953
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 And then people just bonked them on the head and they'd die.

954
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 And then they were also quite curious birds.

955
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 And so the next one would come along going, no, what happens to Jeff?

956
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 And he'd walk around.

957
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 And then just walk up to Jeff and then he'd get bonked on the head.

958
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 And the next one would come and they just died out.

959
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 And then the next one was like, fuck that.

960
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Let's fly out of here.

961
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 Another thing about him, that Douglas Adams said,

962
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 is that they have a mating call, which the male does, which is really boomy and basic.

963
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 And they're just going, I don't know if that's ever.

964
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 And so the thing is, is that he describes it as like being a subwoofer,

965
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 like a real, in the back of a car.

966
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 And the problem with that is that that sound doesn't appear from a location.

967
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 And it appears all around you.

968
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 That's the base kind of just appears everywhere.

969
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 So the female's going, where the hell is this guy?

970
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 They can never find the male.

971
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 And so they ended up not having a lot of sex because the female loses.

972
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 Come here.

973
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 Where?

974
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Here.

975
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 Yeah, that's not a good evolving.

976
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 They've evolved very badly.

977
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 Speaking of a long time ago, things coming down from the trees.

978
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Oh yeah.

979
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 That's really pithicus.

980
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 There is a theory that we developed by beetleism to allow men to show off their larger penises.

981
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Because men, or everyone listening to this, has a very large penis.

982
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Everyone, all men.

983
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 No, that's all men.

984
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 And men.

985
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 I'm always wondered what that was.

986
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 Compared with all other privates, human penises are large.

987
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 So the erect guerrilla penis is three centimetres long.

988
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 The chimpanzee is eight centimetres.

989
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 So there is a theory that, I mean, it's not a widely subscribed to theory

990
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 that we develop walking upright, so men could show off.

991
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 Just so you know, we're going to have to wrap up.

992
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 Any last comments?

993
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 I'll have an odd animal mating weird thing.

994
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 So the green spoon worm.

995
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 Do you know about this guy?

996
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 No.

997
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 When a green spoon worm is born, it doesn't have sex.

998
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 Swins around the sea looking for a roving tongue of a female.

999
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 But so it's an organism, right?

1000
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 It might be it's not neither male nor female.

1001
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 And it swims around looking for the tongue of a female.

1002
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 If it doesn't find it, he becomes female and then has the tongue thing.

1003
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 And if he does, he becomes male, crawls through the female's mouth into her ovary

1004
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 and becomes a sperm-producing machine.

1005
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 And he feeds through his skin because his mouth is constantly spewing out sperm.

1006
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 I mean, I think sperm-producing machine is a valid description of the male of most species.

1007
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 Another one I was like, we need to wrap up, James is like, no, not yet.

1008
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 We do need a wrap up, okay.

1009
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 I like, so there's a kind of strider bug or Jesus bug,

1010
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 which is one of those ones that runs along water,

1011
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 which the women don't really like animals.

1012
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Female females.

1013
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 The female people don't really like copulating,

1014
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 because they usually fertilize the first time they copulate.

1015
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 So they only want to do every couple of months, whereas the men want to do it constantly.

1016
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 And it's like often attention in the animal kingdom is that men want to have sex lose

1017
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 to like give you their sperm, but women, once they're first,

1018
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 but I say don't want to have sex.

1019
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 So anyway, the men or the male strider bugs as they're sometimes known.

1020
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 How developed these like protrusions on their legs where they can grab a woman's eyeball?

1021
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 So he grabs the female's eyeball and like clutches,

1022
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 and they're specially designed now, the front legs of this strider bug,

1023
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 to get around the eyeball, pull her to you, and then...

1024
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 That's like, I really caught her eye.

1025
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 Not quite as romantic any more, guys.

1026
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

1027
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000

00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 We'll be back again next week with another live episode from Soho Theatre.

1036
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 We'll see you then. Have a good night. Goodbye.

 [Applause]

1038
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 Well, thanks so much, guys. Thanks for coming.

1039
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 We're going to be up in the bar now, just drinking and hanging out.

1040
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 So if you want to do that, if you want to let us...

1041
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 Because this is our first one here, and we've got five more.

1042
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 Let us know if that was shit or if it was fun.

1043
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 And what we can do, difference.

1044
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 Yeah, very true. We can still cancel the other five.

1045
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 But now we better get out of here. Thank you very much, everyone.

1046
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 Thank you very much.

1047
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 [Applause]
