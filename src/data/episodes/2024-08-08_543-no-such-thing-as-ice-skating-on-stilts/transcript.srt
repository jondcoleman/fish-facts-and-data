00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 Hi everyone welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. One

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,640
 little bit of time sensitive news to let you know this morning or afternoon or

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,580
 evening depending on when you're listening is that we are doing a live

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,760
 show coming up next Monday that's Monday the 12th of August and it is in

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,320
 London at the Udder Belly. It's gonna be a full podcast and then in between we're

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,400
 gonna do lots of little bits and pieces that we're trying out ahead of our

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,580
 upcoming tour so you get to see lots of stuff that frankly no one will ever see

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,840
 again but it's gonna be a whole load of fun. If you'd like to get tickets for that

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,040
 then you'll have to be really quick because tickets went on sale earlier

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,920
 this week and we've already announced it to our club fish members. It's also a

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,680
 very small venue so there won't be many tickets left but if you go to

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,800
 nosixthingasafish.com forward slash live then you'll be able to get those and

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,120
 actually you'll be able to get tickets to any of our upcoming live shows.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,560
 Secondarily or actually probably much more excitingly for most of you we have

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,120
 a very very very very very special guest on today's show. Who is it Anna? It is

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,640
 none other than the hero of many of our youths anyone who watched Jackass as a

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,440
 kid or a teen and current hero still Johnny Knoxville. We were so excited to

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,160
 learn a few months ago that he is a fan of no such thing as a fish and in fact

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:29,000
 just a big old nerd and so we persuaded him to come on the show and it was

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,200
 truly brilliant so fun to do it with someone who knows exactly what it's

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,040
 about and who is a genuine geek about so many cool things. He himself has

22
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,920
 another brilliant podcast called pretty sure I can fly. It is an exploration of

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,400
 things that limit human beings and then the people who smash down those

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,720
 limitations they interview awesome people who've done incredible things it's

25
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,200
 him and Elna Baker who you might know from this American life definitely worth

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,560
 listening to but first of all hello Andy here we actually have a bonus

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,080
 announcement which is that we are making a sneaky trip to the Edinburgh Fringe in

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,880
 just a few days time on the 14th of August we're going to be at the Edinburgh

29
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,520
 Playhouse at 8 p.m. this is our last pre-tour live show so it's just going to

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,840
 be a brand new episode of the podcast itself it's going to be so much fun if

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,840
 you're at the Fringe or if you know someone who is or if you simply live in

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,600

 tickets available for just 25 pounds if you would like to come and see us go to

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,160
 no such thing as a fish.com/live that's it hope to see you there on with the show

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:57,800
 hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,880
 coming to you from four undisclosed locations around the world my name is

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,200
 Dan Schreiber I'm sitting here with James Harkin Anna Tyshinski and Johnny

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,680
 Knoxville and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,360
 four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we

41
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,760
 go starting with fact number one that is Johnny. Johnny Paycheck who scored a

42
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,200
 number one hit with take this job and shove it once shot a man over a bowl of

43
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:34,240
 turtle soup country music is so badass yeah guys don't prejudge because he had

44
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,760
 had a day yeah he had had a day go and justify it wait what do you mean over a

45
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,840
 bowl of turtle soup well I'm going to get to that later but he took umbrage to

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,960
 the fact that he was offered a bowl of turtle soup and so he had to retaliate

47
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,200
 he had no choice so you gotta be careful Anna because I don't want you to be shot

48
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,240
 over a discussion of a shooting over some turtle soup thank God this is on zoom

49
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,200
 yeah he's in a bar right and a fan cool mind in his own bit yeah he was what

50
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,960
 happened was it was 1985 he just wound up his tour and he was hanging out at a

51
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,200
 Hell's Angels clubhouse because he loved to hang out the Hell's Angels and at

52
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,880
 that point a bomb threat got called in from another motorcycle gang so thinking

53
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,880
 quickly he gathered up all the cocaine in the clubhouse got in his car and took

54
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:32,480
 off and he's going to his mom's house in Ohio along the way he stops at this bar

55
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,480
 right and he is pinned on cocaine and he walks in and these two guys walk up to

56
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,240
 him and really crowed them and talking to him really chatty one guy's name is

57
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,880
 Larry Wise and they start drinking together and they exchange hats which

58
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:55,400
 incensed paycheck it made him angry one was holding a bottle and I believe

59
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,360
 Paycheck's lawyer later said that that he was scared of broken bottles and that

60
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,560
 further inflamed him I think that's some bullshit they made up afterwards then

61
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,000
 the guys like hey Johnny we got some turtle soup out in the truck would you

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,480
 like some turtle soup and that was the final straw right cool he thought well

63
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,560
 they must think I'm some kind of hick and so he pulled his 22 out of his

64
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:30,200
 waistband and shot Larry in the head but Johnny's so short it just skims up his

65
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:38,440
 brow and shoots his hat off like a borrower he called me that's cool yeah

66
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,480
 Larry didn't even know he'd been shot until he'd been over and his ears were

67
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,760
 ringing and he saw blood all over the floor and at that point he said I know

68
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,480
 I had been shot and he just runs out of the bar as fast as he can and Paycheck

69
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:58,240
 follows him going oh come on back Larry I won't shoot you no more that's really

70
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,280
 interesting I didn't know this story and I thought well for me turtle soup is

71
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,160
 supposed to be really tasty no yeah I've never had it I think wasn't the thing

72
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,400
 that in the 19th century all the posh people loved it and it was meant to be

73
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,640
 delicious and then fell out of favor but is it a hick thing do we think it was

74
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,720
 meant as an insult no I think they were just he was he was on like eight ball or

75
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,640
 two so anything was going to come across weird to Johnny Paycheck yeah and he

76
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,960
 fought it for ages didn't he it was it went back and forth as a case about

77
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,760
 whether or not he was guilty and it was only years later that he eventually was

78
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,320
 found guilty by a court and and got a jail sentence off the back of it yeah

79
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,080
 for in 91 he went to Chilacothe prison for seven to nine years but he was only

80
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,680
 in there for two before the governor big dick Celeste partied him

81
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,200
 did he give himself that big name yeah that was yeah that was self-given

82
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,200
 if you're a man called Celeste I think you've got to have big dick as the

83
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:07,200
 preamble property who is this Johnny Paycheck then Johnny because I'm not

84
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:14,640
 into country music I must admit is he a big name yes he was a wonderful bass

85
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,960
 player and singer he played with George Jones for many years and then he went

86
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,880
 out on his own in the 60s actually him and his friend founded Little Darling

87
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:32,200
 Records in the 60s so he was way ahead of the curve on that and in the 70s he had

88
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,920
 a lot of hits with the outlaw country movement which I was actually was not

89
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,600
 familiar with the outlaw country movement but it sounds like a bunch of

90
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,160
 people just thought country was way too soft or had gone a bit soft and so

91
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,640
 outlaw country artists were basically the hardcore country guys right who lived

92
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,480
 really rough and ready lives and he's the extreme example like it couldn't

93
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,240
 help Johnny Paycheck when he was in court and they were citing previous songs

94
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,360
 that he had published like pardon me I've got someone to kill I like a great

95
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,280
 drink in in driving yeah yeah his big song was called take this job and shove

96
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,000
 it and yeah that was written by a guy called David Allen Coe who also spent

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,280
 time in Chili Kothi prison and he only got into songwriting when he was in

98
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,680
 prison because one of the inmates that he was hanging out with was another guy

99
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,920
 called Screamin' Jay Hawkins who is a huge singer he did that song I put a

100
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,000
 spell on you but um I mean that prison was produced a lot of great country

101
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,840
 artists can I just say this guy was in court right yeah and they're using his

102
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,640
 songs as evidence against you know I realized they're just songs like this

103
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,840
 guy who sang I put a spell on you did he get done for witchcraft yeah right no

104
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,720
 they obviously didn't I'm just saying when you've got a catalogue with quite

105
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,680
 aggressive murdery sounding things it can't help I think I think it does with

106
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,840
 drill music here which I don't even know if Johnny would know about right but

107
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,760
 at some that sometimes used against people I believe drill music lyrics but

108
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,600
 yeah he became sort of a working-class hero a bit with take this job and shove

109
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,600
 it right I think people yes we're a big fan of that because it was tough living

110
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,560
 in America around about that time people didn't like their bosses the New York

111
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,400
 Times obituary of him described him as someone who led a rowdy jail-prone life

112
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,800
 yeah quite a few prison sentences yeah he got in trouble a lot he was on tour

113
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,480
 with Patsy Klein and he and he stole her car they were playing this fairgrounds

114
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,800
 and he stole her car and they're like up paycheck has stolen her car and they

115
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,320
 just closed the front gates of the fairgrounds and he just drove round and

116
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,680
 round the fairgrounds till the car ran out of gas and then he got out and went

117
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,280
 back to the show what's interesting is it sounds a bit like the rowdy life was

118
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,320
 slightly encouraged I was reading an interview with Willie Nelson so he was

119
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,600
 on the publicity road plugging his new book which is called roll me up and

120
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,200
 smoke me when I die and he was saying you know did you ever get into scrapes

121
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,840
 just to have the material and his responses I don't want to mention any

122
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,320
 names but I do know one country singer whose manager would intentionally get

123
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,520
 him in trouble with his girlfriends and wives and then get him drunk just so

124
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,000
 that he could write because that's when he penned his best stuff and it sounds

125
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,520
 like Willie Nelson had a wildlife as well this is one of the questions from

126
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,400
 the interviewer your first wife Martha once sewed you up in a bedsheet while

127
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,960
 you were asleep and beat you with a broomstick was she a particularly

128
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,960
 crafty woman or were you a really bad husband oh it was a combination of both

129
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:39,000
 like in Willie didn't have to worry because he had this drummer Paul English

130
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,480
 who started out as a pimp and Fort Worth and Willie was having trouble getting

131
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,280
 paid for his shows so he hired Paul English to be his drummer and collect

132
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,160
 for him after the shows he had his gun in Bill Graham's mouth Paul English oh my

133
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,800
 god Bill Graham was like a famous promoter and Bill Graham was trying to

134
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,360
 hoodwink them on the payment and he's like let me leave and I'll go get the

135
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,960
 money and English had his gun in his mouth says no you're gonna stay right

136
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,280
 here son send him to get the money and that guy went got the money and Willie

137
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,040
 got paid how long did he wait just out of curiosity how long was that gun in the

138
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,560
 mouth because that you know a bank run can take a while can't it oh there was

139
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,920
 drooling he comes back 30 minutes later and he's like I forgot the pen I'm sorry

140
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:37,360
 I'm gonna have to go do it again is this what it's still like is Keith Urban

141
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,240
 rocking around with a with a revolver I don't think it's like it was in in the

142
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,160
 day oh well you know Billy Joe Shaver legendary singer songwriter was in a

143
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,720
 bar in Lorena Texas and this guy was being disrespectful to Billy Joe telling

144
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,520
 him to shut up after a while Billy Joe goes let's go outside son and they went

145
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,680
 outside and Billy Joe walked over to his car guy's pistol walk up to the man goes

146
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,040
 where do you want it and then shot him in the mouth or as Billy Joe said right

147
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,720
 between the mother and the fucker and the guy lived out of interest when he asked

148
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,360
 the question where do you want it and then he shot him in the mouth had the guy

149
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,440
 asked for the mouth no he didn't answer you didn't he didn't give him time to

150
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,120
 answer which is where I have problem with the story but other than that you know I

151
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,840
 love Billy Joe sure yeah yeah the mouth no sorry the tow the tow I'm afraid I

152
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,960
 have to take your first answer just one thing about Johnny paycheck that kind of

153
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,840
 endeared me to him because he is a rough guy and he led quite dark life but one

154
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,280
 quite sweet story I liked was he was asked to sing the national anthem in a

155
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,760
 stadium before one of the Atlanta Falcons football games so he's there a

156
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,520
 Falcons game the crowds is massive and as he struck the first cord he forgot all

157
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,040
 the worse the American national anthem

158
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,480
 and he just it sounds awful and he said it was it was horrible and he just made up

159
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,880
 the words he just made up kind of nonsense words poor guy that's amazing

160
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,640
 really I didn't know that story I have to look that I want to see if there's any

161
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,440
 footage of that I think there might be because they've recorded what the

162
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,640
 lyrics were that he made up I think he was a songwriter

163
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,320
 so yeah imagine if they were just way better than the original

164
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,160
 yeah we changed it based on them and he did clean himself up later on I think

165
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,560
 didn't he Johnny paycheck and he would give anti-drug talks to kids and stuff

166
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,960
 but everyone was just still expecting him to be off his face on cocaine and

167
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,320
 pissed and all that kind of stuff so I think he kind of even though he was

168
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,680
 clean he did play up to it quite a lot yeah didn't he

169
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,360
 and that song take your take this job and shove it

170
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,760
 it got turned into a movie yeah I really love this it's the first

171
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,760
 movie to ever have a monster truck in it

172
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,560
 it's the best piece of information and apparently it like started the big monster

173
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,720
 truck craze in America wow oh what a what a cool interlinking bit of history

174
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,400
 yeah the the guy who wrote take this job and shove it as you mentioned

175
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,280
 earlier David Allen Cole between the ages of nine and 35 he spent about half

176
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,800
 that time in prison in and out of correctional institutions

177
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,360
 and got out became a singer songwriter had a lot of success

178
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,480
 but in the 80s he stopped singing to become a magician

179
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,400
 and let me tell you he is the scariest looking

180
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,640
 magician you have ever seen so funny and ventriloquist

181
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,240
 and actually Penn from Penn and Teller

182
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,920
 said that he saw David Allen Cole perform as a kid

183
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,120
 and he had a big influence on him really so yeah I don't know if I trust someone

184
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,520
 hanging around with that crew I'd expect if they said they were going to

185
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,520
 saw someone in half they might just actually saw them in half

186
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,400
 so yeah that would be serious um he's his son by the way is a podcaster

187
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,040
 so Tyler Mahon Co and he makes a show called cocaine and rhinestones

188
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,480
 which actually sounds brilliant it's all about the sort of mysteries of country

189
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,360
 music and the history of its stars and so on

190
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,640
 so yeah because Co called himself the rhinestone cowboy didn't he

191
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,000
 and that was way before the mysterious rhinestone cowboy

192
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,120
 he formed in a mask and here is here's a picture of him

193
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,880
 when he was with his ventriloquist dummy is he the most frightening

194
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,480
 I've talked to Tyler Co about that and he goes my dad told me that dummy was

195
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,640
 real and alive and that really scared me when I was little

196
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,920
 I could just imagine someone going tell me where you want me to shoot you and

197
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,120
 the dummy goes in his mouth no not in his mouth yeah in his mouth

198
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,320
 okay it is time for fact number two and that is my fact

199
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,640
 my fact is that in the 1980s skateboarder Nardis Carpus

200
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,560
 had his merchandise banned in many schools and shops because it was believed

201
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,920
 he was evil after some people noticed that his first name

202
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,920
 Nardis spelt backwards was satan

203
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,520
 wow and was it like how he changed his name to satan backwards

204
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,240
 no he's he's um I mean Johnny you actually you know this guy the skateboarder

205
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,440
 but he's Lithuanian by descent and uh yeah it's a it's a name there it means

206
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,160
 birth of Christ but it is satan backwards and when

207
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,440
 people saw that there was a bit of a panic that what if this guy

208
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,520
 is in cahoots with the devil we can't have his skateboard and backpack

209
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,680
 sold in our shops and so he suffered a sort of ban

210
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,920
 it wasn't a countrywide ban but certainly it affected him and made news

211
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,120
 so funny yeah he overcame that ban because he was

212
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,000
 one of the most legendary street skaters him and Mark Gonzalez

213
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,320
 you know I think Nardis was the first guy to ollie up on a rail

214
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,400
 and uh and an ollie as the three of us have probably been learning some

215
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,000
 skating terminology and ollie is the one where you jump in the air with your

216
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,480
 skateboard right yeah it's where you it's where you so

217
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,280
 you need a skateboard that is got uh two bits that flip up at the end as

218
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,280
 opposed to like the street skate board where it's flat on one end push down

219
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,440
 slide your foot forward raise in the air and land and I you forget that Dan

220
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,480
 really is into skateboard yeah I was skater yeah my whole my whole

221
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,560
 teenage are we in a podcast where 50% of us can do an ollie yeah

222
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,560
 oh I I can't I'm tear I would only skate when we needed footage

223
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,840
 of someone smashing right so you're good at falling off

224
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,040
 yeah yes but yeah I'm just uh on Nardis quickly he as Johnny's just pointed

225
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,120
 out he was one of the originals he was one of the guys who took skating

226
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,400
 into the modern era such of street skating he was

227
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,960
 one of the first people um if not the first credited with doing a grind

228
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,120
 down a rail he didn't land it that's still though is like yeah it was like wow

229
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,160
 that doesn't count but the idea the idea yeah but anyone could have an I can

230
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,240
 have an idea of what I'm gonna do then if I can't do it then

231
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,040
 yeah but that's like saying any astronauts that died before they got to

232
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,720
 space because the ship blew up aren't astronauts no you didn't make it funny

233
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,480
 no it's not it's like me saying that my daughter's got a little rocket ship and

234
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,760
 she's singing zoom zoom going to the moon and she's an astronaut

235
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,640
 no no he's come on he didn't just look at the rail and say I want to do that and

236
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,560
 then fall over it sounds like he actually got up onto it right okay yeah

237
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,600
 he also he also innovated the idea of wall skating where you can go off the

238
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,280
 side of the street and literally go on the wall and come back down and land and

239
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,280
 so that was him as well so he's a big he's a big player in the in the history

240
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,840
 of modern skating but it's interesting because skating has always been

241
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,600
 associated with sort of debauchery and it's kind of like the country music of

242
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,280
 the the sports world right yeah it's especially in the 90s

243
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,080
 obviously skating has just become an olympic sport and the previous olympics

244
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,080
 I think was the debut for it and so I went on their website and they've got

245
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,280
 a really interesting history of skateboarding on there including the

246
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,240
 fact that in 1978 for a decade skateboarding was banned in Norway

247
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,160
 because kind of like like not us they just thought it's leading to all these

248
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,000
 deaths it's a bad influence and so on they'd heard that a hundred thousand

249
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,520
 people had been injured and that 28 children had died

250
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,720
 and so importing skateboards and having any ramps of any kind were not allowed

251
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,160
 in Norway and so there was a black market there was like a hidden

252
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,160
 forest area that people would set up halfpipes and they would

253
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,040
 they would sneakily make black market boards that they would pretend with

254
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,840
 something else and then you would turn them into a full skateboard and

255
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,120
 so it was through decade what do they pretend it was do you think they

256
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,000
 pretended it was a weird flute or something

257
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 it's still banned in Manchester in England is it skateboarding yeah yeah

258
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,120
 because dangerous um I think it was because it was associated with youths

259
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,120
 yeah do you know what I mean like actually the place where everyone

260
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,880
 skateboards in Manchester they still do it they're just not allowed to

261
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,000
 yeah I mean because you can't stop kids from skateboarding

262
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,840
 to be fair it's quite dangerous I think it is on safety grounds that it tends to

263
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,160
 be banned and people get injured it reminds me

264
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,880
 quite a lot of and I don't know if they have this in America as well but in

265
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,160
 Britain at the moment there's a lot of panic about scooters

266
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,240
 you know those electric scooters people ride um they're so dangerous and there's

267
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,800
 lots of spurious stats thrown around about how dangerous they are

268
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,880
 but it's it's quite risky but also that's what makes it cool and I was reading

269
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,440
 that the reason actually skateboarding really struggled to get into the

270
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,560
 Olympics for a while was because skateboarders didn't want to because

271
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,480
 the Olympics is kind of lame and really mainstream and normal

272
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,400
 people like me watch it every night whereas skateboarders

273
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,760
 are really cool and so I think there was a you know a lot of

274
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,120
 organizations did not campaign to get included in the Olympics because

275
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,640
 it's really interesting I think we might have said this before we started

276
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,560
 recording about how uh breakdancing is coming into the Olympics

277
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,920
 yeah soon and we're all looking forward to it but I know a lot of people in the

278
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,120
 breakdancing community were not happy about it being in the Olympics for that

279
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,520
 exact same reason and what they thought was that a lot of

280
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,200
 ballroom dancers think that ballroom dancing should be in the Olympics and

281
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,880
 all these different kind of dancing and they thought that the ballroom dancers

282
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,720
 were using breakdancing as like a gateway drug to the Olympics and then

283
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,960
 once breakdancing is in all of the dancing will get in

284
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,520
 and they thought the Olympics I don't have a problem with that actually because

285
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,920
 there's some sports that like dressage where the horse pants is I'm like what

286
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,880
 is happening right now yeah my girlfriend loves it

287
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,360
 I'll get in trouble for saying that but I'm just I can't get behind it

288
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,160
 I agree I think a lot of the equestrian stuff is the horses need the metals

289
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,560
 some of the equestrian competitors are really quite old because I was thinking

290
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,640
 Britain sent a team of three skateboarders and it's the biggest age

291
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,920
 range in a skateboarding team and I thought maybe the guide that we sent

292
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,320
 Andy McDonald might be the oldest competitor so he's 51

293
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,040
 I think actually I think he turned 52 yesterday

294
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,520
 and the two other girls that we've sent are 16 so that's quite nice the team is

295
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,360
 two 16 year olds and then someone who's more than three times their age

296
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,320
 but yeah in the equestrian you get 60 something year olds

297
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,520
 yeah just goes to show it the horses aren't 60 something are they

298
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,040
 yeah you try to think what event could I possibly

299
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,480
 do well in in the Olympics and it would have to be something where you sit on a

300
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,400
 horse or yeah definitely I'm too old to be a

301
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,600
 skateboarder I reckon because I was reading about a 1080

302
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,760
 trick which is uh six turns right on a skateboard

303
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,440
 that sounds impossible a six that sounds like James if you want to try it I'll

304
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,040
 film it yeah yeah I think is it not because it's

305
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,800
 that if it's the number of degrees it would be three turns right if it's 1080

306
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,480
 yeah unless unless the 11 year olds dad was standing at the side

307
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,640
 and just went gave them extra spins as they were going by I guess it is it's

308
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,040
 three 360s isn't it so yeah the first person to ever do it

309
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,240
 on a standard ramp was 11 years old and it previously only been done on what's

310
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,680
 called a mega ramp which is a bit like a ski jump

311
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,280
 and the only people who'd done that last time I checked were

312
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,840
 11 years old 12 years old 15 years old and 15 years old

313
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,800
 and I'm wondering at the age of 45 whether I'll maybe a bit beyond it

314
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,720
 well like I said the other guy's 51 so it obviously takes all sorts but it does

315
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,040
 seem to be dominated by people under the age of 20

316
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,520
 usually when you see those it's like Tony Hawk waiting at the bottom of the

317
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,760
 ramp with like a nine-year-old at this like 200 foot ramp and he's like just

318
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,120
 give it a go and that seems to be his gig at the moment forcing

319
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,600
 nine-year-olds down ramps Tony Hawk seems to be the only

320
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,360
 person who's gained mainstream fame and it's massive mainstream fame

321
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,520
 I'm not totally sure how especially because he retired when he was 30 31 I

322
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,120
 think from competing anyway and the the thing I

323
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,800
 could find that he's done most recently is get into a big conversation with Apple

324
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,520
 about what the skateboard emoji should look like

325
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,480
 so when you try and say skateboard in your whatsapp messages which

326
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,640
 we all do a lot obviously the skateboard there is based on his

327
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,480
 skateboard because when we've talked about the consortium that designs

328
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,280
 emojis but when they released what they thought was going to be their

329
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,600
 skateboard emoji in 2017 he messaged them being like that

330
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,280
 shit that looks like something from the 80s here's a photo of my skateboard do

331
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,840
 you want to give it another go right so so why is he so big because he is the

332
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,840
 only one I've heard of as well like he had video games and stuff right no one

333
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,600
 has done more for the sport of skateboarding than Tony he's

334
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,360
 like the ambassador of skateboard and he's one of the greatest skaters of

335
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,520
 all time and he's very intelligent well spoken

336
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,360
 and he also when he landed the 900 back in I can't remember when it was

337
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,880
 he was already big but he exploded you know after that I think that's when the

338
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,360
 Tony Hawk games came out and he's uh the 900

339
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,760
 is that number of degrees turn yes yeah that is spinning around in the air

340
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,120
 yes loads of times loads of times of a big rep

341
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,520
 he as James points out this the the the big moment in terms of commercialness

342
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,040
 was the video games Tony Hawk Pro Skater was a global

343
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,800
 sensation he effectively became what Michael Jordan is to basketball he

344
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,080
 became to skateboarding uh interestingly he's ruined the life of

345
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,680
 one man in the UK who is a quite well known

346
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,000
 comedian called Tony Hawks with a nest at the end

347
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,920
 whose whole life has been absolutely ruined his online life with people

348
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,360
 mistaking him as the skater so a few years ago he actually

349
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,720
 published a book called Tony Hawks the A to Z of skateboarding

350
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,560
 where he replies to the emails of everyone who's asked him for skateboarding

351
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,360
 advice with just terrible uninformed responses

352
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,840
 that's going to confuse people even more people like me who do always confuse

353
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,440
 them now I'm like hang on he's the one who's written the skateboarding book

354
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,720
 when jackass started we got sued by this man

355
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:19,280
 named jack ass because we had ruined his good name

356
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,600
 that's incredible did you ever beat him did you ever get to

357
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,800
 I never got to meet mr ass no I would love to

358
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,280
 mr ass suggests that the case is still going on the respectful way

359
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,200
 and there was some legal trouble with the guy from my hometown

360
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,160
 whose name was reverend general Johnny Knoxville

361
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:46,240
 who sold plots of land on the moon and oh yes I think he came after me at one

362
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,800
 point and oh wow yeah interesting for my

363
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,920
 birthday one year I wanted to sue all my friends but my

364
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,160
 attorney talked me out of it I was just gonna make up some

365
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,520
 I don't know I just thought it'd be funny to like sue 10 of my friends and then

366
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,280
 have to hire attorneys and just be a big pain in their ass

367
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,920
 yeah yeah how many friends do you have left now

368
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,520
 out of interest well that's true I would have had to

369
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,280
 sue like three people multiple times yeah

370
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,760
 while we're talking about skateboarding I you know most of the jackass guys

371
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,760
 we came from big brother magazine which was a skateboarding magazine owned by

372
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,200
 Larry flint he owned a bunch of mags not as art

373
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,880
 directed one of the articles I wrote for a snowboarding mag but anyway a big

374
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,880
 brother there was a mix up in the shipping department

375
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,000
 one day and all the people that were supposed to get

376
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,360
 big brother magazine got taboo magazine which was Larry flint's dirtiest

377
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,080
 magazine and and all the people that were supposed

378
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,560
 to get taboo got big brother so it was it was really bad

379
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,080
 because a bunch of 14 year olds got taboo and a bunch of dribble

380
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,040
 ejaculators got you know big brother and I don't know who was more upset I

381
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,520
 would assume the people who got taboo I don't know I think some of those 14

382
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:13,760
 year olds were pretty delighted oh best day yeah yeah yeah taken yeah

383
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,400
 I found a skateboarding record I think we could break

384
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,160
 oh goodness world record okay um let's do it I think

385
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,200
 well maybe Johnny or Dan you can say I'm totally wrong but basically on

386
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,120
 February 17th 2017 a guy called Brandon Gonzalez

387
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,920
 performed a stationary manual that lasted two hours and 55 minutes and now I

388
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,440
 obviously had to look up where that was but it's just standing it's just

389
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,280
 standing on your skateboard right no with one foot in the air and one foot on

390
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,760
 the ground no but the but the the tail can't touch the

391
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,960
 ground oh can it not so it's a balance act you

392
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,840
 would be balancing I didn't see that from the picture

393
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,240
 on the two back wheels doing her 27th hour standing on a skateboard come on

394
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,920
 guys I'm absolutely smashing this it's so

395
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,960
 easy but Guinness adjudicated going behind her going oh

396
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,920
 shit I didn't see okay no I got this wrong man okay I take that back I'm

397
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,760
 sorry okay yeah no is the answer we cannot

398
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,000
 break that one

399
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,480
 okay it is time for fact number three that is Anna my fact this week is that

400
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,720
 when Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier he brought 220 gallons of alcohol on the

401
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,200
 flight with him nice I've done a trick in us Anna I've

402
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,360
 done a trick but I found this so surprising

403
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,440
 so Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in 1947

404
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:52,080
 in the bell x1 plane and the fuel it used was alcohol

405
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,160
 like it was just a huge tank of alcohol so it was burning liquid oxygen and then

406
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,120
 a mixture of five parts alcohol to one part

407
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,280
 water which seems incredibly weird and is not something that

408
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,480
 like occasionally you talk about alcohol fuel there are jokes that Prince

409
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,960
 Charles runs his cars off wine there are certain places that

410
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,600
 use ethanol in their vehicles but it doesn't seem that ordinary but it seems

411
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,200
 like yeah he ran them off ethanol I imagine it's quite dangerous

412
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,720
 I suppose you wouldn't want to drop a drop a lit match in there

413
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,480
 but then you wouldn't want to win any of it and you wouldn't want to drink it

414
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,600
 halfway through the flight either yeah multiple if you distill it through a

415
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,960
 sock it's probably safe because I think that's what people in prison do with

416
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,520
 rubbing alcohol they distill it through their sock and then

417
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,920
 but hey kids don't do that you know because but you know if you're desperate

418
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,160
 if you've run out of wine yeah yeah was that fuel for all the p-51 bombers at the

419
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,680
 time um I'm not sure I know it was fuel for the

420
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,000
 flights that he flew over that time period yeah I don't think he will have been

421
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,600
 I think because this was a very experimental plane right yeah yeah it

422
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,720
 was flying it was more modeled on a rocket I think

423
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,000
 and he nicknamed it sweetly the glamorous glenus

424
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,920
 after his fiance who was called glenus fade dickhouse I know thank god he didn't

425
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,680
 go for the surname we mentioned our product is a production

426
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,800
 company no really yeah that's our production

427
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,840
 companies come off it no way they're not the glenus

428
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,240
 well no no it just uh that was a coincidence

429
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,960
 yeah and it was sweet but I remember I was reading

430
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,160
 a book about Chuck Yeager and to woo his wife he said stick with me honey and

431
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,360
 you'll be farting through silk

432
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,400
 had a real way with words Chuck Yeager

433
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,480
 nice the the night before he broke the sound barrier this is

434
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,920
 widely known he he had broke his ribs in a horse riding accident

435
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,800
 and the doctor who is rumored to have patched him up

436
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,720
 was this man colonel John Paul Stapp now

437
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:00,320
 he was a physician flight surgeon and led some of the most groundbreaking

438
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,720
 experiments on deceleration uh it was like the late 40s to mid 50s

439
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,560
 and they were trying to determine what it was like for pilots to

440
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,800
 eject at high altitudes and also what they can withstand in a plane crash

441
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,720
 so they thought a person could only withstand 18 g's

442
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,480
 of force and a g is like the amount of force the earth's

443
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,920
 gravitational field exerts on human body when you're standing

444
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,840
 still anyway they thought they could only withstand 18 g's

445
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,080
 and he knew that was wrong because being a flight surgeon he could look at the

446
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,280
 crash records and see that these pilots had

447
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,400
 was stood more than that but the plane had failed

448
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,480
 so he did all these experiments and one was

449
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,760
 they had this rocket sled and he would strap himself to it

450
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,360
 and he would go up to speeds which eventually reached 630 miles an hour

451
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,080
 and stop within 1.5 seconds oh yeah it's not safe

452
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,000
 no and 630 miles an hour by the way was faster than

453
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,720
 a speeding bullet at that time wow and come to a complete stop

454
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,600
 and i think the last time he did it he experienced

455
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:21,280
 46.2 g's wow and he went temporarily blind afterwards

456
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,800
 and not only that not only did he go temporarily blind

457
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,480
 but he ended up with two black eyes because when he stopped

458
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,400
 his eyes shot forward into his socket so hard

459
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,040
 like somebody sees Jessica Rabbit yeah exactly

460
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,640
 they went blank and he ended up with black eyes and

461
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,560
 prior to doing it he was so sure that this blindness would happen

462
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,640
 that he spent a lot of time in his room blindfolded and trying to work out how

463
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,200
 to exist without sight anymore because he thought

464
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,160
 that's what's going to happen that's so cool that's like being punched in the

465
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,840
 face from the inside isn't it yeah inside your head

466
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,640
 exactly but i think am i right that he broke the

467
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,800
 land speed record i think he was known as the fastest man on earth

468
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,840
 yeah time magazine did a bit he was on all the tv shows he was a huge star then

469
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,720
 and now no one knows him yeah that's weird i read that

470
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,080
 when he stopped for that instant his body weighed about 7700 pounds

471
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,240
 what yeah um which is about the same as a white rhino

472
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,760
 wow because your weight is your mass times the gravitational

473
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,920
 but he did he didn't balloon to it did he no no it's just like

474
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,520
 it's more of a mathematical thing really but yeah what a shame

475
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,960
 he was trying to prove what humans could withstand but it feels like it's a loose

476
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,640
 definition of withstand because yeah he went blind had black eyes he cracked

477
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,440
 his ribs he broke his wrists his respiratory and

478
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,680
 circulatory systems were really badly damaged

479
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,880
 i mean you know there's withstand again there's um

480
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,720
 living through in good health isn't there yeah there's what's standing and

481
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,440
 there's a showing off yeah exactly there's a thin line between

482
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,200
 a great guitar fill and a smart ass guitar player

483
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,320
 he's i don't quite get that but i think i agree with it

484
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,400
 he's also the reason by the way for the term murphy's law yeah we have murphy's

485
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,920
 law because of him yeah because on on an experiment

486
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,040
 that was done five years earlier where they're testing out the speeds it was

487
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,160
 captain murphy who was part of the test and

488
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,600
 afterwards when snap was utterly injured like

489
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,200
 really broken murphy just kind of explained that anything that can go

490
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,640
 wrong will go wrong in different words that became murphy's law

491
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,920
 it needs an addendum anything that can go wrong will go wrong if you are working

492
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,520
 with kernel john snap who doesn't mental shit

493
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,720
 snap did nothing wrong he was just the passenger it was murphy

494
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,360
 have you johnny i i imagine within the uh the world of jackass that you've

495
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,280
 done a few things testing the pull of gravity um

496
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,280
 well gravity is the funniest comedian of all time

497
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,880
 and in my opinion i never reached a speed of 630 miles an hour on anything

498
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,160
 but yeah gravity did play a part that in newton's third law of motion

499
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,840
 without those two things i'd have no career

500
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,200
 thank god for physics yes thank god that's so good you know snap is also

501
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,320
 the reason we have uh seatbelts in cars

502
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,800
 now yeah he was also testing restraint systems

503
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,200
 and finally got the air force to listen when he explained that we're losing

504
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,960
 more pilots on the ground than we are in the air

505
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,680
 and there's a snap car crash conference that he founded i think still goes on

506
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,200
 today so wow what a good guy

507
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,400
 yeah should we talk a bit more about chart keager oh yeah yeah

508
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,600
 please um he was really hardcore another really

509
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,720
 hardcore one along with those country artists in world war two

510
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,880
 he um distinguished himself by being just amazing at dog fighting

511
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,200
 basically didn't hear and he loved it um so great in a plane but he

512
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,560
 had this episode i didn't know about where he was shot down over france

513
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,560
 and so he has to bail out with his parachute and he said he could see

514
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,160
 german soldiers all over the ground below but luckily he landed

515
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,960
 in a forest uh but this meant that he had to climb over the mountains to cross

516
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,480
 the border to get into safe territory and so he's like knee deep in snow he's

517
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,160
 had to bail out of his plane he's with a comrade

518
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,560
 and they almost get caught and have a really awful scrape when they find a

519
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,880
 hut to sleep in and the guy he's with leaves his socks

520
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,120
 outside the cabin to dry which i'd be so pissed off about

521
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,200
 german soldiers came past how did they be distilling their alcohol

522
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,720
 if he's a good point that's oh wow so yeah the

523
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,360
 Germans came past and they started shooting at them so then they leap out

524
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,000
 the window and his navigator who's the guy with him

525
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,960
 is badly shot but then an incredibly cool thing i think this is what happened

526
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,480
 they both jumped onto or chuck basically carried his badly injured

527
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,520
 navigator onto a log slide which i think must have

528
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,240
 just been one of those log flumes that they used to carry logs down mountains

529
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,960
 and they cascaded down the mountain on this log side to escape

530
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,080
 he then amputates his friend's leg with a pen knife

531
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,760
 yeah just out of anger because he's so pissed off with him

532
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,280
 that's one less sock you'll need

533
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,320
 but yeah then he takes his leg off and then he leaves him by the side of the

534
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,240
 road says bye and fortunately he's rescued and

535
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,440
 saved but i mean jager didn't know that jager just

536
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,280
 left a legless man on the side of the road and yeah he had one leg he didn't

537
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,320
 he didn't take both his legs off you gotta make some hard decisions

538
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,360
 yeah yeah he got picked up by the resistance and

539
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,920
 at the time if you spent time with the resistance and got back to america you

540
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,640
 were no longer allowed to fly again because if

541
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,960
 you got shot down again you may give up the resistance

542
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,040
 but he went to washington and lobbied to i don't know what was washington but he

543
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,720
 lobbied with a general and said look i want to go back

544
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,360
 if i get caught i won't say a word and i think he was the first person to be

545
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,760
 allowed to fly again after being captured

546
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,920
 wow this is jager right yeah when he was young this was way before he was

547
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,120
 chuck jager this was just just a hard-ass kid

548
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,320
 because then when he was doing that all of his flying

549
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,640
 afterwards by all rights he should have been one of the first astronauts right

550
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,400
 you would have expected him to be like he couldn't get in because he didn't have a

551
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,280
 degree and i get the feeling that that really pissed

552
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,840
 him off for pretty much his whole life after that

553
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,520
 yeah impression it's interesting there's it's a big role

554
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,520
 in the movie the right stuff which was a book by tom wolf where you see him

555
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,200
 sort of getting overlooked because he was the man you know he

556
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,480
 yes he could do anything in the movie he kind of makes

557
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,920
 pizza with it but yeah you get the impression that he should have been

558
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,600
 there with neil on the moon wow widely recognizes the greatest natural pilot to

559
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,320
 ever live he had 2010 vision yeah uses built for it

560
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,920
 what is that because i thought 2020 was the best but it's clearly not right if

561
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,920
 2010 is better anything that you can see from

562
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,800
 10 meters he could see the same from 20 meters

563
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,800
 okay so it's twice as good as you twice as good actually a lot more than that for

564
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,680
 you but for a normal person yeah yeah i'm not a good

565
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,600
 person to use of that um how interesting and he yeah

566
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,400
 i mean bringing up the apollo astronauts um the glennis fey his wife

567
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,400
 uh such a such a shame that the sound barrier wasn't broken in a plane called

568
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,360
 the dick house that's such a shame but he named he named three of his

569
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,800
 initial planes after her the glamorous glenn and then glennis

570
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,760
 became a name afterwards and they were married until

571
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,320
 his dying day and i think her dying day in fact sorry her dying day

572
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,960
 um he died 2020 didn't he um i used to i used to follow him facebook i used to

573
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,280
 get updates all the time from from chucky agar he was very active on facebook

574
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,840
 was he yeah um but yeah that was rare all the apollo and mercury

575
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,920
 astronauts ended in divorce multiple times and him and his wife were a unit

576
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,520
 all the way to the end and in fact i think he used that when he was when

577
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,000
 there was a discussing who's going to try and break the sound barrier who's

578
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,760
 going to be our test pilot i think they said there was an argument that it

579
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,160
 should be someone who was single and childless because then if they died

580
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,080
 it didn't matter it was just one person and i think he argued no it's much

581
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,080
 better to choose someone like me who's got a wife and a little boy who i love

582
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:35,040
 because i'll be much more careful and uh so i'll make sure that i do

583
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,720
 survive it it's an argument that worked for him so we don't need to interrogate

584
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,120
 now fill her up with booze i'm going on a horse ride

585
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:48,960
 yeah he did uh an experiment with kernel john paul staff as well uh they

586
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,520
 did a wind blast experiment where they went up in a plane

587
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,000
 without a canopy on it and reached speeds of over 500 miles an hour

588
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,440
 and people were saying no don't do that you're going to be decapitated this or

589
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,520
 that but you know they were fine decapitated by just the the them that

590
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,960
 much the wind yeah how were they fine i'm really

591
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,560
 surprised because i'm a story that is always told about me is when my mom was

592
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,160
 driving the car when i was a baby and they had you know you had like a you've

593
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,800
 got roof window what do you call it sunroof sunroof thank you um and

594
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,400
 my dad was holding me and my mom was a very fast driver and my dad thought it

595
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,760
 would be really funny to lift me up he was just holding me on his lap

596
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,360
 lifted me up and put my head out the window and my mom said she's never been

597
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,880
 so furious with him i mean in a way it was her fault for driving 100 miles an

598
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,040
 hour along main road but um i think i i think it wasn't that fun for me as a

599
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,040
 baby i'll be honest anna i don't think anyone

600
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,840
 comes out well with that story i was an innocent victim

601
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,280
 i can just see in the background johnny slightly going tell me those footage

602
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,880
 that i could use in the future

603
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:02,880
 oh yeah they survived it

604
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,000
 okay it is time for our final fact of the show

605
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,880
 and that is james okay my fact this week is that according to tradition

606
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,280
 of the banner people of ethopia before a man can become a man

607
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,080
 he has to learn how to walk on stilts

608
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,360
 okay you know like i see i don't drive but i'm told that if i fail

609
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,400
 the driving test enough times they just give it to you

610
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,360
 is there like that's not true that's not true no no no all right i'll learn then

611
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,880
 okay damn you're thinking how many times can you fall off the stilts before they

612
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,920
 just go okay have your penis anywhere yeah exactly

613
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,600
 i think they always have a penis it's just like their culture

614
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,400
 has got like quite a complex level of age groups like you go from this age group

615
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,800
 to this age group to this age group uh and to go from and actually this is true

616
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,720
 of a lot of people around the world but to go from adolescence to manhud

617
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,440
 they have a ceremony and part of that ceremony involves them having to strike

618
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,920
 a balance on stilts and it's supposed to show that

619
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,160
 you're strong minded independently willed confident

620
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:17,120
 and ready to take on a wife okay it's what all women want

621
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,600
 yeah man you can walk on stilts yeah i've walked on stilts before

622
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,120
 it's pretty yeah yeah i've had i you know not

623
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,600
 ginormously high ones but i would say four feet in the air at least

624
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,520
 and that's high they're fine they're they're really easy to get used to

625
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,280
 yeah straight away what was the context in which you're walking on stilts

626
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,080
 i think i was at a house that just had a lot of um party gear and stilts were

627
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:46,080
 part of the the gear and i just gave it a badge maybe you just have a natural

628
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,920
 affinity to stilts wow yeah it can't be that easy

629
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,960
 because people make a living from doing it so it can't be that well no but they

630
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,240
 do more complicated things with it right like i'm just

631
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,120
 yeah and they do it funny clothes and to be fair when i was watching a video of

632
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,240
 these banner kids some kids on stilts and they mostly look like they're having

633
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,600
 so much fun and they find it extremely entertaining which it would be

634
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,640
 and also the interviewer says to one of these little kids who's just running

635
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,520
 around on stilts so how long have you been doing this how long does it take to

636
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,120
 get ready is it months years and the guys like i just started yesterday mate

637
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,120
 it's i mean so maybe i think dan might be right i think like this is a piece of

638
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,320
 cake you may be right and the idea was that the tribe would

639
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,160
 traditionally use stilts to avoid wild animals and also you can see over the

640
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,640
 savannah yes absolutely because actually there's

641
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,880
 a tradition in europe of shepherds using stilts for the same reason

642
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,400
 because you can get much higher up and you can see where all your sheep's are

643
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,000
 and stuff like that is this the landis region it's over quite a lot of Europe

644
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,520
 yeah the landis especially the landis in southwestern france this is amazing

645
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,520
 they basically everyone in this town existed on stilts but it largely was

646
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,800
 the farmers and exactly it was for that you would you would be on your stilts so

647
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,920
 that you could see where all your sheep where it was also very

648
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,600
 mushy and muddy in the ground and so it was very useful to get around by

649
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,640
 standing on the stilt you had a big stick

650
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,240
 which was what you would use to what's the word for when you're

651
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,760
 getting the sheep into shepherd yeah you'd shepherd them with your big old

652
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,880
 hood and but you would then use the big stick as a

653
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,720
 seat so you like a tripod so you'd place your bum on it and they would just do

654
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,600
 their knitting all day long would they yeah

655
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,840
 oh that's nice with their recently shorn sheep's wool presumably yeah

656
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,520
 exactly do with it lovely yeah these the banner people it's

657
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,240
 weird that they say it's to then escape predators

658
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,000
 because they also paint their bodies in black and white stripes that do resemble

659
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 quite closely a zebra it came with them and i was offering tips

660
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,440
 i feel like don't don't disguise yourself as a zebra

661
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,280
 yeah that's true one of the other ceremonies that they do is when they're

662
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,840
 just about to get married uh and that is a bull-weeping ceremony

663
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,160
 so you line up a load of cows in a row and everyone has to run

664
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,000
 and jump over the backs of four cows without falling

665
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,760
 and if you can do that then you're allowed to get married whoa four cows

666
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,080
 it's not for you know like it's not like evil keneval jumping over four at once

667
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,240
 yeah jump over one like slight hurdles okay yeah yeah

668
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,200
 well i think i'd like to see james jump over four at once

669
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:21,280
 i'm really uh becoming focused on james doing his son i'm actually very

670
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,320
 scared of cows so perfect yeah what else are you scared of james

671
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:34,160
 oh commitment i'll make sure your wife doesn't listen to this episode then

672
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,600
 when we were filming wild boys we came across a lot of

673
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,680
 rite of passages for boys to become a man and they're a lot were quite

674
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,160
 entertaining and one sent my friend chris ponies to the hospital

675
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,920
 the satari moe tribe uh hope i'm pronouncing that right in brazil

676
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:58,640
 they will go out in the jungle and gather up bullet ants which are one of the

677
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,400
 worst stings in the uh insect kingdom it's like 30

678
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,480
 times worse than a bee sting and they'll gather up all the bullet ants

679
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,040
 and they'll weave them into a glove of leaves with their

680
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,600
 stingers sticking out and to become a man you have to put

681
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,280
 your hand in the glove of bullet ants for 10 minutes

682
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,120
 and take it and steve olimpanius both did it and

683
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,960
 there was most excruciating pain that that was it

684
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,400
 they've endured yeah and that's a high bar for them in fact

685
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,160
 wow yes more than that's good to know because i think we might have mentioned

686
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,840
 bullet ants before and you know they're this extreme pain animal and sometimes

687
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,280
 i think are they that painful or are they just kind of they've gained this

688
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,000
 reputation but you can verify steve says hurts a lot

689
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,240
 yeah dude yeah um yeah ponies had to go to the hospital

690
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,520
 because he had an allergic reaction anytime he gets stung by anything he

691
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,800
 has to go to the hospital um i was looking up just i was just

692
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,280
 googling around with the word stilt and i discovered that one of the greatest

693
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,800
 early day basketball players had the nickname the stilt which was

694
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:12,240
 wilt the stilt chamberlain which i i had no idea about yeah so wilt chamberlain

695
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,920
 very famously scored a hundred points in a single game

696
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,960
 he did free throws in that match underarm which we know is a better way of doing

697
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,240
 three throws but we also know that basketball players think they look too

698
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,720
 wimpy when they're doing it so they do it in the

699
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,960
 overarm way instead he also is responsible for the fact

700
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,480
 that when you take a shot at the foul line so ana i know

701
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,320
 it's going to be hard to describe but this is a thing when you're

702
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,520
 fouled you go when you get two shots in the basket in the key

703
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,280
 and then then ana has just written a book about sport

704
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,400
 it's called a lot of old balls the qi book of sport

705
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,000
 it's available now in all good bug shops and she knows everything about wilt

706
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,640
 chamberlain so you know all about this you shot yourself in the foot there down

707
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,000
 if you didn't want us to mention it better better than in the mouth ana

708
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,800
 so um where do you want it so yeah so um he's responsible for a major rule change

709
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,160
 within basketball as well which is the fact that when he used to shoot at the

710
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,440
 foul line he's six for eleven he would jump and

711
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,200
 dunk it and that's not allowed anymore so they said you have to remain behind

712
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,920
 the foul line but the stilt thing is really

713
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,840
 interesting in his name wilt the stilt chamberlain because

714
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,200
 everyone called him it it was the nickname that was used in every paper

715
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,120
 and magazine and he hated it it was given to him in the early days and when

716
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,640
 people were on his team were playing on a opposing team their their coaches

717
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,160
 would be like don't call him the stilt he'll go nuts he's he's really upset

718
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,320
 why didn't he hate it what's wrong with the stilt it's not they called him wilt

719
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,960
 the asshole he won't yeah i don't he will calm down

720
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,520
 dickhouse chamberlain he well he could have been called that he

721
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:52,000
 supposedly that's another story on yeah apparently 20 000 women were bedded by

722
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 wilt the stilt um he's sure they were but he loved the name the dipper or dippy

723
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,600
 and he got it because as i said he was ginormous six foot 11 and it's got

724
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:07,840
 nothing to do with basketball it was one day he kept walking into doorways

725
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,280
 because he's so tall and one doorway cracked him in the eyes

726
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,800
 he got a black eye and they started calling him dippy because

727
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,880
 they needed to remind him to dip down anytime he was heading out of doorway

728
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,640
 and that's the name he loved but he was wilt the stilt to the end well i had to

729
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:27,120
 say wilt the stilt it's a little snappier yeah yeah yeah it is

730
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,200
 and cool and you can't make your own nicknames guys so

731
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,560
 get over that yeah well big dick james harkin

732
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:44,880
 says different it's like a walking stick full of bagels

733
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,480
 i think the tallest stilt walk in history it certainly claims to be

734
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,760
 speaking of people who make their own nicknames a guy called roi maloy

735
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:58,880
 which bit is the nickname in roi maloy yeah i think

736
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,560
 it's not even a good one i just think he wasn't born roi maloy

737
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,400
 i think that might be a you know to make his name rhyme maybe it doesn't even

738
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,440
 qualify as a nickname all right he's like a nom de plume

739
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:15,360
 a nom de plume exactly thank you so he's set a bunch of world records for world

740
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,360
 records and in 2008 he set the unverified world

741
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,880
 record for the tallest stilts walk ever but i was looking up i

742
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,480
 again i i know i keep making wild claims but i think we can break this one too

743
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,000
 um johnny you could definitely do this surely you've done something similar to

744
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,080
 this because it was 17 meter high stilts which is high that's like

745
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,920
 five stories yeah there you go for all the yanks

746
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,520
 there you go for the yanks um and he had to mount them by going up to the fifth

747
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,200
 story of a building and lean the stilts next to the building and then he mounts

748
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,640
 them from there wow but then it's a little bit like

749
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,800
 if you're teaching a baby to walk he's got his helpers you can just see their

750
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,320
 hands in the video and he's clinging onto their hands and then he just let's go

751
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,600
 for a second does a really quick bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop one two three

752
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,520
 four five on the spot on the stilts and then falls back into their arms again

753
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,480
 and says that's the tallest stilts walk in history

754
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,560
 i don't think that counts i don't think it counts either i think you've got to get

755
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,120
 from a to b and they need to be in different places

756
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:20,720
 did they hand him his penis after you're now a man

757
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,440
 17 meter penis have you not ever walked on stilts johnny it seems like the kind

758
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,760
 of thing that jackass would have done some kind of still walking stunts i can

759
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,160
 barely walk on my own two feet which really helped me in stunts

760
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:40,880
 but steve o was a clown when we initially hired him he worked at a carnival

761
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,960
 a circus inside of a swap meet in florida it was bleak

762
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:51,520
 so he did a lot of stunt walking and we we did one or two things with stilts but

763
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,440
 they're nice to look at but you need a little blunt force trauma

764
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,800
 to to make something watchable sure well you can still walk into a into a wall if

765
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,360
 you want yeah but yeah do you know i'm

766
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,960
 something interesting i haven't actually got the research on this i just this is

767
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,400
 something i remember is that with stilt walking

768
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,600
 there was a person who had cerebral palsy and found that their walking was

769
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,560
 better when they were on stilts it helped to improve them

770
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,000
 in some respects with their gait and how they're walking and michael j fox

771
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,680
 also talks about that when he goes ice skating it really

772
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,680
 causes the tremors that he has to sort of mellow down and rest a bit

773
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,200
 interesting interesting i wonder the medical benefits of i'm not suggesting

774
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,680
 that everyone be just ice skating and on stilts if there no ice skating on

775
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,360
 stilts i love it there you go that's how you get the blunt trauma

776
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,400
 yeah yeah harkin stunt there we go yeah

777
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,200
