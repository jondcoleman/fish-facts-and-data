00:00:00,00:00:04,Hi everyone welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. One
00:00:04,00:00:08,little bit of time sensitive news to let you know this morning or afternoon or
00:00:08,00:00:12,evening depending on when you're listening is that we are doing a live
00:00:12,00:00:17,show coming up next Monday that's Monday the 12th of August and it is in
00:00:17,00:00:22,London at the Udder Belly. It's gonna be a full podcast and then in between we're
00:00:22,00:00:26,gonna do lots of little bits and pieces that we're trying out ahead of our
00:00:26,00:00:31,upcoming tour so you get to see lots of stuff that frankly no one will ever see
00:00:31,00:00:34,again but it's gonna be a whole load of fun. If you'd like to get tickets for that
00:00:34,00:00:38,then you'll have to be really quick because tickets went on sale earlier

00:00:41,00:00:45,very small venue so there won't be many tickets left but if you go to

00:00:59,00:01:05,a very very very very very special guest on today's show. Who is it Anna? It is
00:01:05,00:01:10,none other than the hero of many of our youths anyone who watched Jackass as a
00:01:10,00:01:17,kid or a teen and current hero still Johnny Knoxville. We were so excited to
00:01:17,00:01:21,learn a few months ago that he is a fan of no such thing as a fish and in fact
00:01:21,00:01:29,just a big old nerd and so we persuaded him to come on the show and it was
00:01:29,00:01:32,truly brilliant so fun to do it with someone who knows exactly what it's
00:01:32,00:01:37,about and who is a genuine geek about so many cool things. He himself has
00:01:37,00:01:43,another brilliant podcast called pretty sure I can fly. It is an exploration of
00:01:43,00:01:48,things that limit human beings and then the people who smash down those
00:01:48,00:01:51,limitations they interview awesome people who've done incredible things it's
00:01:51,00:01:56,him and Elna Baker who you might know from this American life definitely worth
00:01:56,00:01:59,listening to but first of all hello Andy here we actually have a bonus
00:01:59,00:02:04,announcement which is that we are making a sneaky trip to the Edinburgh Fringe in

00:02:36,00:02:57,hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:02:57,00:03:02,coming to you from four undisclosed locations around the world my name is
00:03:02,00:03:07,Dan Schreiber I'm sitting here with James Harkin Anna Tyshinski and Johnny
00:03:07,00:03:10,Knoxville and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our
00:03:10,00:03:15,four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we
00:03:15,00:03:21,go starting with fact number one that is Johnny. Johnny Paycheck who scored a
00:03:21,00:03:26,number one hit with take this job and shove it once shot a man over a bowl of
00:03:26,00:03:34,turtle soup country music is so badass yeah guys don't prejudge because he had
00:03:34,00:03:39,had a day yeah he had had a day go and justify it wait what do you mean over a
00:03:39,00:03:44,bowl of turtle soup well I'm going to get to that later but he took umbrage to
00:03:44,00:03:49,the fact that he was offered a bowl of turtle soup and so he had to retaliate
00:03:49,00:03:54,he had no choice so you gotta be careful Anna because I don't want you to be shot
00:03:54,00:04:00,over a discussion of a shooting over some turtle soup thank God this is on zoom
00:04:00,00:04:06,yeah he's in a bar right and a fan cool mind in his own bit yeah he was what
00:04:06,00:04:11,happened was it was 1985 he just wound up his tour and he was hanging out at a
00:04:11,00:04:16,Hell's Angels clubhouse because he loved to hang out the Hell's Angels and at
00:04:16,00:04:21,that point a bomb threat got called in from another motorcycle gang so thinking
00:04:21,00:04:25,quickly he gathered up all the cocaine in the clubhouse got in his car and took
00:04:25,00:04:32,off and he's going to his mom's house in Ohio along the way he stops at this bar
00:04:32,00:04:37,right and he is pinned on cocaine and he walks in and these two guys walk up to
00:04:37,00:04:41,him and really crowed them and talking to him really chatty one guy's name is
00:04:41,00:04:47,Larry Wise and they start drinking together and they exchange hats which
00:04:47,00:04:55,incensed paycheck it made him angry one was holding a bottle and I believe
00:04:55,00:05:00,Paycheck's lawyer later said that that he was scared of broken bottles and that
00:05:00,00:05:05,further inflamed him I think that's some bullshit they made up afterwards then
00:05:05,00:05:10,the guys like hey Johnny we got some turtle soup out in the truck would you
00:05:10,00:05:15,like some turtle soup and that was the final straw right cool he thought well
00:05:15,00:05:21,they must think I'm some kind of hick and so he pulled his 22 out of his
00:05:21,00:05:30,waistband and shot Larry in the head but Johnny's so short it just skims up his
00:05:30,00:05:38,brow and shoots his hat off like a borrower he called me that's cool yeah
00:05:38,00:05:42,Larry didn't even know he'd been shot until he'd been over and his ears were
00:05:42,00:05:46,ringing and he saw blood all over the floor and at that point he said I know
00:05:46,00:05:51,I had been shot and he just runs out of the bar as fast as he can and Paycheck
00:05:51,00:05:58,follows him going oh come on back Larry I won't shoot you no more that's really
00:05:58,00:06:02,interesting I didn't know this story and I thought well for me turtle soup is
00:06:02,00:06:08,supposed to be really tasty no yeah I've never had it I think wasn't the thing
00:06:08,00:06:11,that in the 19th century all the posh people loved it and it was meant to be
00:06:11,00:06:16,delicious and then fell out of favor but is it a hick thing do we think it was
00:06:16,00:06:21,meant as an insult no I think they were just he was he was on like eight ball or
00:06:21,00:06:28,two so anything was going to come across weird to Johnny Paycheck yeah and he
00:06:28,00:06:31,fought it for ages didn't he it was it went back and forth as a case about
00:06:31,00:06:35,whether or not he was guilty and it was only years later that he eventually was
00:06:35,00:06:40,found guilty by a court and and got a jail sentence off the back of it yeah
00:06:40,00:06:46,for in 91 he went to Chilacothe prison for seven to nine years but he was only
00:06:46,00:06:51,in there for two before the governor big dick Celeste partied him
00:06:51,00:06:56,did he give himself that big name yeah that was yeah that was self-given
00:06:56,00:07:01,if you're a man called Celeste I think you've got to have big dick as the
00:07:01,00:07:07,preamble property who is this Johnny Paycheck then Johnny because I'm not
00:07:07,00:07:14,into country music I must admit is he a big name yes he was a wonderful bass
00:07:14,00:07:20,player and singer he played with George Jones for many years and then he went
00:07:20,00:07:25,out on his own in the 60s actually him and his friend founded Little Darling
00:07:25,00:07:32,Records in the 60s so he was way ahead of the curve on that and in the 70s he had
00:07:32,00:07:35,a lot of hits with the outlaw country movement which I was actually was not
00:07:35,00:07:39,familiar with the outlaw country movement but it sounds like a bunch of
00:07:39,00:07:44,people just thought country was way too soft or had gone a bit soft and so
00:07:44,00:07:48,outlaw country artists were basically the hardcore country guys right who lived
00:07:48,00:07:53,really rough and ready lives and he's the extreme example like it couldn't
00:07:53,00:07:57,help Johnny Paycheck when he was in court and they were citing previous songs
00:07:57,00:08:02,that he had published like pardon me I've got someone to kill I like a great
00:08:02,00:08:08,drink in in driving yeah yeah his big song was called take this job and shove
00:08:08,00:08:13,it and yeah that was written by a guy called David Allen Coe who also spent
00:08:13,00:08:18,time in Chili Kothi prison and he only got into songwriting when he was in
00:08:18,00:08:21,prison because one of the inmates that he was hanging out with was another guy
00:08:21,00:08:26,called Screamin' Jay Hawkins who is a huge singer he did that song I put a
00:08:26,00:08:31,spell on you but um I mean that prison was produced a lot of great country
00:08:31,00:08:35,artists can I just say this guy was in court right yeah and they're using his
00:08:35,00:08:39,songs as evidence against you know I realized they're just songs like this
00:08:39,00:08:43,guy who sang I put a spell on you did he get done for witchcraft yeah right no
00:08:43,00:08:47,they obviously didn't I'm just saying when you've got a catalogue with quite
00:08:47,00:08:52,aggressive murdery sounding things it can't help I think I think it does with
00:08:52,00:08:55,drill music here which I don't even know if Johnny would know about right but
00:08:55,00:09:00,at some that sometimes used against people I believe drill music lyrics but
00:09:00,00:09:04,yeah he became sort of a working-class hero a bit with take this job and shove
00:09:04,00:09:09,it right I think people yes we're a big fan of that because it was tough living
00:09:09,00:09:13,in America around about that time people didn't like their bosses the New York
00:09:13,00:09:18,Times obituary of him described him as someone who led a rowdy jail-prone life
00:09:18,00:09:24,yeah quite a few prison sentences yeah he got in trouble a lot he was on tour
00:09:24,00:09:29,with Patsy Klein and he and he stole her car they were playing this fairgrounds
00:09:29,00:09:34,and he stole her car and they're like up paycheck has stolen her car and they
00:09:34,00:09:38,just closed the front gates of the fairgrounds and he just drove round and
00:09:38,00:09:41,round the fairgrounds till the car ran out of gas and then he got out and went
00:09:41,00:09:48,back to the show what's interesting is it sounds a bit like the rowdy life was
00:09:48,00:09:52,slightly encouraged I was reading an interview with Willie Nelson so he was
00:09:52,00:09:56,on the publicity road plugging his new book which is called roll me up and
00:09:56,00:10:02,smoke me when I die and he was saying you know did you ever get into scrapes
00:10:02,00:10:05,just to have the material and his responses I don't want to mention any
00:10:05,00:10:10,names but I do know one country singer whose manager would intentionally get
00:10:10,00:10:13,him in trouble with his girlfriends and wives and then get him drunk just so
00:10:13,00:10:17,that he could write because that's when he penned his best stuff and it sounds
00:10:17,00:10:20,like Willie Nelson had a wildlife as well this is one of the questions from
00:10:20,00:10:24,the interviewer your first wife Martha once sewed you up in a bedsheet while
00:10:24,00:10:27,you were asleep and beat you with a broomstick was she a particularly
00:10:27,00:10:31,crafty woman or were you a really bad husband oh it was a combination of both
00:10:31,00:10:39,like in Willie didn't have to worry because he had this drummer Paul English
00:10:39,00:10:44,who started out as a pimp and Fort Worth and Willie was having trouble getting
00:10:44,00:10:49,paid for his shows so he hired Paul English to be his drummer and collect
00:10:49,00:10:54,for him after the shows he had his gun in Bill Graham's mouth Paul English oh my
00:10:54,00:10:58,god Bill Graham was like a famous promoter and Bill Graham was trying to
00:10:58,00:11:03,hoodwink them on the payment and he's like let me leave and I'll go get the
00:11:03,00:11:06,money and English had his gun in his mouth says no you're gonna stay right
00:11:06,00:11:11,here son send him to get the money and that guy went got the money and Willie
00:11:11,00:11:15,got paid how long did he wait just out of curiosity how long was that gun in the
00:11:15,00:11:18,mouth because that you know a bank run can take a while can't it oh there was
00:11:18,00:11:25,drooling he comes back 30 minutes later and he's like I forgot the pen I'm sorry
00:11:25,00:11:37,I'm gonna have to go do it again is this what it's still like is Keith Urban
00:11:37,00:11:42,rocking around with a with a revolver I don't think it's like it was in in the
00:11:42,00:11:48,day oh well you know Billy Joe Shaver legendary singer songwriter was in a
00:11:48,00:11:54,bar in Lorena Texas and this guy was being disrespectful to Billy Joe telling
00:11:54,00:11:59,him to shut up after a while Billy Joe goes let's go outside son and they went
00:11:59,00:12:03,outside and Billy Joe walked over to his car guy's pistol walk up to the man goes
00:12:03,00:12:09,where do you want it and then shot him in the mouth or as Billy Joe said right
00:12:09,00:12:14,between the mother and the fucker and the guy lived out of interest when he asked
00:12:14,00:12:17,the question where do you want it and then he shot him in the mouth had the guy
00:12:17,00:12:21,asked for the mouth no he didn't answer you didn't he didn't give him time to
00:12:21,00:12:25,answer which is where I have problem with the story but other than that you know I
00:12:25,00:12:31,love Billy Joe sure yeah yeah the mouth no sorry the tow the tow I'm afraid I
00:12:31,00:12:36,have to take your first answer just one thing about Johnny paycheck that kind of
00:12:36,00:12:41,endeared me to him because he is a rough guy and he led quite dark life but one
00:12:41,00:12:47,quite sweet story I liked was he was asked to sing the national anthem in a
00:12:47,00:12:51,stadium before one of the Atlanta Falcons football games so he's there a
00:12:51,00:12:57,Falcons game the crowds is massive and as he struck the first cord he forgot all
00:12:57,00:13:01,the worse the American national anthem
00:13:01,00:13:06,and he just it sounds awful and he said it was it was horrible and he just made up
00:13:06,00:13:10,the words he just made up kind of nonsense words poor guy that's amazing
00:13:10,00:13:14,really I didn't know that story I have to look that I want to see if there's any
00:13:14,00:13:17,footage of that I think there might be because they've recorded what the
00:13:17,00:13:20,lyrics were that he made up I think he was a songwriter
00:13:20,00:13:24,so yeah imagine if they were just way better than the original
00:13:24,00:13:30,yeah we changed it based on them and he did clean himself up later on I think
00:13:30,00:13:34,didn't he Johnny paycheck and he would give anti-drug talks to kids and stuff
00:13:34,00:13:38,but everyone was just still expecting him to be off his face on cocaine and
00:13:38,00:13:42,pissed and all that kind of stuff so I think he kind of even though he was
00:13:42,00:13:45,clean he did play up to it quite a lot yeah didn't he
00:13:45,00:13:49,and that song take your take this job and shove it
00:13:49,00:13:53,it got turned into a movie yeah I really love this it's the first
00:13:53,00:13:57,movie to ever have a monster truck in it
00:13:57,00:14:02,it's the best piece of information and apparently it like started the big monster
00:14:02,00:14:08,truck craze in America wow oh what a what a cool interlinking bit of history
00:14:08,00:14:12,yeah the the guy who wrote take this job and shove it as you mentioned
00:14:12,00:14:17,earlier David Allen Cole between the ages of nine and 35 he spent about half
00:14:17,00:14:20,that time in prison in and out of correctional institutions
00:14:20,00:14:25,and got out became a singer songwriter had a lot of success
00:14:25,00:14:30,but in the 80s he stopped singing to become a magician
00:14:30,00:14:34,and let me tell you he is the scariest looking
00:14:34,00:14:38,magician you have ever seen so funny and ventriloquist
00:14:38,00:14:42,and actually Penn from Penn and Teller
00:14:42,00:14:45,said that he saw David Allen Cole perform as a kid
00:14:45,00:14:51,and he had a big influence on him really so yeah I don't know if I trust someone
00:14:51,00:14:53,hanging around with that crew I'd expect if they said they were going to
00:14:53,00:14:57,saw someone in half they might just actually saw them in half
00:14:57,00:15:02,so yeah that would be serious um he's his son by the way is a podcaster
00:15:02,00:15:07,so Tyler Mahon Co and he makes a show called cocaine and rhinestones
00:15:07,00:15:10,which actually sounds brilliant it's all about the sort of mysteries of country
00:15:10,00:15:13,music and the history of its stars and so on
00:15:13,00:15:16,so yeah because Co called himself the rhinestone cowboy didn't he
00:15:16,00:15:20,and that was way before the mysterious rhinestone cowboy
00:15:20,00:15:23,he formed in a mask and here is here's a picture of him
00:15:23,00:15:28,when he was with his ventriloquist dummy is he the most frightening
00:15:28,00:15:34,I've talked to Tyler Co about that and he goes my dad told me that dummy was
00:15:34,00:15:38,real and alive and that really scared me when I was little
00:15:38,00:15:41,I could just imagine someone going tell me where you want me to shoot you and
00:15:41,00:15:47,the dummy goes in his mouth no not in his mouth yeah in his mouth
00:15:52,00:15:56,okay it is time for fact number two and that is my fact
00:15:56,00:16:00,my fact is that in the 1980s skateboarder Nardis Carpus
00:16:00,00:16:04,had his merchandise banned in many schools and shops because it was believed
00:16:04,00:16:07,he was evil after some people noticed that his first name
00:16:07,00:16:11,Nardis spelt backwards was satan
00:16:11,00:16:17,wow and was it like how he changed his name to satan backwards
00:16:17,00:16:22,no he's he's um I mean Johnny you actually you know this guy the skateboarder
00:16:22,00:16:27,but he's Lithuanian by descent and uh yeah it's a it's a name there it means
00:16:27,00:16:30,birth of Christ but it is satan backwards and when
00:16:30,00:16:33,people saw that there was a bit of a panic that what if this guy
00:16:33,00:16:37,is in cahoots with the devil we can't have his skateboard and backpack
00:16:37,00:16:41,sold in our shops and so he suffered a sort of ban
00:16:41,00:16:45,it wasn't a countrywide ban but certainly it affected him and made news
00:16:45,00:16:49,so funny yeah he overcame that ban because he was
00:16:49,00:16:54,one of the most legendary street skaters him and Mark Gonzalez
00:16:54,00:16:58,you know I think Nardis was the first guy to ollie up on a rail
00:16:58,00:17:02,and uh and an ollie as the three of us have probably been learning some
00:17:02,00:17:06,skating terminology and ollie is the one where you jump in the air with your
00:17:06,00:17:08,skateboard right yeah it's where you it's where you so
00:17:08,00:17:13,you need a skateboard that is got uh two bits that flip up at the end as
00:17:13,00:17:17,opposed to like the street skate board where it's flat on one end push down
00:17:17,00:17:21,slide your foot forward raise in the air and land and I you forget that Dan
00:17:21,00:17:24,really is into skateboard yeah I was skater yeah my whole my whole
00:17:24,00:17:28,teenage are we in a podcast where 50% of us can do an ollie yeah
00:17:28,00:17:32,oh I I can't I'm tear I would only skate when we needed footage
00:17:32,00:17:37,of someone smashing right so you're good at falling off
00:17:37,00:17:43,yeah yes but yeah I'm just uh on Nardis quickly he as Johnny's just pointed
00:17:43,00:17:47,out he was one of the originals he was one of the guys who took skating
00:17:47,00:17:50,into the modern era such of street skating he was
00:17:50,00:17:54,one of the first people um if not the first credited with doing a grind
00:17:54,00:17:59,down a rail he didn't land it that's still though is like yeah it was like wow
00:17:59,00:18:04,that doesn't count but the idea the idea yeah but anyone could have an I can
00:18:04,00:18:08,have an idea of what I'm gonna do then if I can't do it then
00:18:08,00:18:11,yeah but that's like saying any astronauts that died before they got to
00:18:11,00:18:14,space because the ship blew up aren't astronauts no you didn't make it funny
00:18:14,00:18:18,no it's not it's like me saying that my daughter's got a little rocket ship and
00:18:18,00:18:21,she's singing zoom zoom going to the moon and she's an astronaut
00:18:21,00:18:26,no no he's come on he didn't just look at the rail and say I want to do that and
00:18:26,00:18:30,then fall over it sounds like he actually got up onto it right okay yeah
00:18:30,00:18:35,he also he also innovated the idea of wall skating where you can go off the
00:18:35,00:18:39,side of the street and literally go on the wall and come back down and land and
00:18:39,00:18:43,so that was him as well so he's a big he's a big player in the in the history
00:18:43,00:18:45,of modern skating but it's interesting because skating has always been
00:18:45,00:18:49,associated with sort of debauchery and it's kind of like the country music of
00:18:49,00:18:53,the the sports world right yeah it's especially in the 90s
00:18:53,00:18:58,obviously skating has just become an olympic sport and the previous olympics
00:18:58,00:19:02,I think was the debut for it and so I went on their website and they've got
00:19:02,00:19:05,a really interesting history of skateboarding on there including the
00:19:05,00:19:10,fact that in 1978 for a decade skateboarding was banned in Norway
00:19:10,00:19:14,because kind of like like not us they just thought it's leading to all these
00:19:14,00:19:18,deaths it's a bad influence and so on they'd heard that a hundred thousand
00:19:18,00:19:21,people had been injured and that 28 children had died
00:19:21,00:19:26,and so importing skateboards and having any ramps of any kind were not allowed
00:19:26,00:19:30,in Norway and so there was a black market there was like a hidden
00:19:30,00:19:34,forest area that people would set up halfpipes and they would
00:19:34,00:19:37,they would sneakily make black market boards that they would pretend with
00:19:37,00:19:39,something else and then you would turn them into a full skateboard and
00:19:39,00:19:43,so it was through decade what do they pretend it was do you think they
00:19:43,00:19:48,pretended it was a weird flute or something
00:19:48,00:19:52,it's still banned in Manchester in England is it skateboarding yeah yeah
00:19:52,00:19:57,because dangerous um I think it was because it was associated with youths
00:19:57,00:20:01,yeah do you know what I mean like actually the place where everyone
00:20:01,00:20:04,skateboards in Manchester they still do it they're just not allowed to
00:20:04,00:20:08,yeah I mean because you can't stop kids from skateboarding
00:20:08,00:20:11,to be fair it's quite dangerous I think it is on safety grounds that it tends to
00:20:11,00:20:14,be banned and people get injured it reminds me
00:20:14,00:20:16,quite a lot of and I don't know if they have this in America as well but in
00:20:16,00:20:20,Britain at the moment there's a lot of panic about scooters
00:20:20,00:20:24,you know those electric scooters people ride um they're so dangerous and there's
00:20:24,00:20:28,lots of spurious stats thrown around about how dangerous they are
00:20:28,00:20:32,but it's it's quite risky but also that's what makes it cool and I was reading
00:20:32,00:20:35,that the reason actually skateboarding really struggled to get into the
00:20:35,00:20:38,Olympics for a while was because skateboarders didn't want to because
00:20:38,00:20:42,the Olympics is kind of lame and really mainstream and normal
00:20:42,00:20:46,people like me watch it every night whereas skateboarders
00:20:46,00:20:49,are really cool and so I think there was a you know a lot of
00:20:49,00:20:53,organizations did not campaign to get included in the Olympics because
00:20:53,00:20:56,it's really interesting I think we might have said this before we started
00:20:56,00:21:00,recording about how uh breakdancing is coming into the Olympics
00:21:00,00:21:03,yeah soon and we're all looking forward to it but I know a lot of people in the
00:21:03,00:21:07,breakdancing community were not happy about it being in the Olympics for that
00:21:07,00:21:11,exact same reason and what they thought was that a lot of
00:21:11,00:21:15,ballroom dancers think that ballroom dancing should be in the Olympics and
00:21:15,00:21:18,all these different kind of dancing and they thought that the ballroom dancers
00:21:18,00:21:22,were using breakdancing as like a gateway drug to the Olympics and then
00:21:22,00:21:26,once breakdancing is in all of the dancing will get in
00:21:26,00:21:29,and they thought the Olympics I don't have a problem with that actually because
00:21:29,00:21:33,there's some sports that like dressage where the horse pants is I'm like what
00:21:33,00:21:36,is happening right now yeah my girlfriend loves it
00:21:36,00:21:41,I'll get in trouble for saying that but I'm just I can't get behind it
00:21:41,00:21:46,I agree I think a lot of the equestrian stuff is the horses need the metals
00:21:46,00:21:50,some of the equestrian competitors are really quite old because I was thinking
00:21:50,00:21:54,Britain sent a team of three skateboarders and it's the biggest age
00:21:54,00:21:57,range in a skateboarding team and I thought maybe the guide that we sent
00:21:57,00:22:02,Andy McDonald might be the oldest competitor so he's 51
00:22:02,00:22:05,I think actually I think he turned 52 yesterday
00:22:05,00:22:09,and the two other girls that we've sent are 16 so that's quite nice the team is
00:22:09,00:22:13,two 16 year olds and then someone who's more than three times their age
00:22:13,00:22:16,but yeah in the equestrian you get 60 something year olds
00:22:16,00:22:19,yeah just goes to show it the horses aren't 60 something are they
00:22:19,00:22:23,yeah you try to think what event could I possibly
00:22:23,00:22:26,do well in in the Olympics and it would have to be something where you sit on a
00:22:26,00:22:30,horse or yeah definitely I'm too old to be a
00:22:30,00:22:33,skateboarder I reckon because I was reading about a 1080
00:22:33,00:22:37,trick which is uh six turns right on a skateboard
00:22:37,00:22:41,that sounds impossible a six that sounds like James if you want to try it I'll
00:22:41,00:22:45,film it yeah yeah I think is it not because it's
00:22:45,00:22:48,that if it's the number of degrees it would be three turns right if it's 1080
00:22:48,00:22:52,yeah unless unless the 11 year olds dad was standing at the side
00:22:52,00:22:56,and just went gave them extra spins as they were going by I guess it is it's
00:22:56,00:23:01,three 360s isn't it so yeah the first person to ever do it
00:23:01,00:23:06,on a standard ramp was 11 years old and it previously only been done on what's
00:23:06,00:23:09,called a mega ramp which is a bit like a ski jump
00:23:09,00:23:13,and the only people who'd done that last time I checked were
00:23:13,00:23:17,11 years old 12 years old 15 years old and 15 years old
00:23:17,00:23:22,and I'm wondering at the age of 45 whether I'll maybe a bit beyond it
00:23:22,00:23:26,well like I said the other guy's 51 so it obviously takes all sorts but it does
00:23:26,00:23:29,seem to be dominated by people under the age of 20
00:23:29,00:23:33,usually when you see those it's like Tony Hawk waiting at the bottom of the
00:23:33,00:23:37,ramp with like a nine-year-old at this like 200 foot ramp and he's like just
00:23:37,00:23:43,give it a go and that seems to be his gig at the moment forcing
00:23:43,00:23:47,nine-year-olds down ramps Tony Hawk seems to be the only
00:23:47,00:23:51,person who's gained mainstream fame and it's massive mainstream fame
00:23:51,00:23:57,I'm not totally sure how especially because he retired when he was 30 31 I
00:23:57,00:24:01,think from competing anyway and the the thing I
00:24:01,00:24:04,could find that he's done most recently is get into a big conversation with Apple
00:24:04,00:24:07,about what the skateboard emoji should look like
00:24:07,00:24:12,so when you try and say skateboard in your whatsapp messages which
00:24:12,00:24:16,we all do a lot obviously the skateboard there is based on his
00:24:16,00:24:20,skateboard because when we've talked about the consortium that designs
00:24:20,00:24:23,emojis but when they released what they thought was going to be their
00:24:23,00:24:27,skateboard emoji in 2017 he messaged them being like that
00:24:27,00:24:31,shit that looks like something from the 80s here's a photo of my skateboard do
00:24:31,00:24:35,you want to give it another go right so so why is he so big because he is the
00:24:35,00:24:39,only one I've heard of as well like he had video games and stuff right no one
00:24:39,00:24:45,has done more for the sport of skateboarding than Tony he's
00:24:45,00:24:49,like the ambassador of skateboard and he's one of the greatest skaters of
00:24:49,00:24:53,all time and he's very intelligent well spoken
00:24:53,00:24:59,and he also when he landed the 900 back in I can't remember when it was
00:24:59,00:25:04,he was already big but he exploded you know after that I think that's when the
00:25:04,00:25:09,Tony Hawk games came out and he's uh the 900
00:25:09,00:25:13,is that number of degrees turn yes yeah that is spinning around in the air
00:25:13,00:25:17,yes loads of times loads of times of a big rep
00:25:17,00:25:21,he as James points out this the the the big moment in terms of commercialness
00:25:21,00:25:25,was the video games Tony Hawk Pro Skater was a global
00:25:25,00:25:28,sensation he effectively became what Michael Jordan is to basketball he
00:25:28,00:25:32,became to skateboarding uh interestingly he's ruined the life of
00:25:32,00:25:35,one man in the UK who is a quite well known
00:25:35,00:25:40,comedian called Tony Hawks with a nest at the end
00:25:40,00:25:43,whose whole life has been absolutely ruined his online life with people
00:25:43,00:25:47,mistaking him as the skater so a few years ago he actually
00:25:47,00:25:50,published a book called Tony Hawks the A to Z of skateboarding
00:25:50,00:25:54,where he replies to the emails of everyone who's asked him for skateboarding
00:25:54,00:25:59,advice with just terrible uninformed responses
00:25:59,00:26:03,that's going to confuse people even more people like me who do always confuse
00:26:03,00:26:07,them now I'm like hang on he's the one who's written the skateboarding book
00:26:07,00:26:10,when jackass started we got sued by this man
00:26:10,00:26:19,named jack ass because we had ruined his good name
00:26:19,00:26:23,that's incredible did you ever beat him did you ever get to
00:26:23,00:26:28,I never got to meet mr ass no I would love to
00:26:28,00:26:33,mr ass suggests that the case is still going on the respectful way
00:26:33,00:26:37,and there was some legal trouble with the guy from my hometown
00:26:37,00:26:40,whose name was reverend general Johnny Knoxville
00:26:40,00:26:46,who sold plots of land on the moon and oh yes I think he came after me at one
00:26:46,00:26:50,point and oh wow yeah interesting for my
00:26:50,00:26:53,birthday one year I wanted to sue all my friends but my
00:26:53,00:26:58,attorney talked me out of it I was just gonna make up some
00:26:58,00:27:01,I don't know I just thought it'd be funny to like sue 10 of my friends and then
00:27:01,00:27:05,have to hire attorneys and just be a big pain in their ass
00:27:05,00:27:07,yeah yeah how many friends do you have left now
00:27:07,00:27:11,out of interest well that's true I would have had to
00:27:11,00:27:17,sue like three people multiple times yeah
00:27:17,00:27:21,while we're talking about skateboarding I you know most of the jackass guys
00:27:21,00:27:25,we came from big brother magazine which was a skateboarding magazine owned by
00:27:25,00:27:29,Larry flint he owned a bunch of mags not as art
00:27:29,00:27:32,directed one of the articles I wrote for a snowboarding mag but anyway a big
00:27:32,00:27:36,brother there was a mix up in the shipping department
00:27:36,00:27:40,one day and all the people that were supposed to get
00:27:40,00:27:45,big brother magazine got taboo magazine which was Larry flint's dirtiest
00:27:45,00:27:50,magazine and and all the people that were supposed
00:27:50,00:27:54,to get taboo got big brother so it was it was really bad
00:27:54,00:27:58,because a bunch of 14 year olds got taboo and a bunch of dribble
00:27:58,00:28:03,ejaculators got you know big brother and I don't know who was more upset I
00:28:03,00:28:07,would assume the people who got taboo I don't know I think some of those 14
00:28:07,00:28:13,year olds were pretty delighted oh best day yeah yeah yeah taken yeah
00:28:13,00:28:16,I found a skateboarding record I think we could break
00:28:16,00:28:20,oh goodness world record okay um let's do it I think
00:28:20,00:28:25,well maybe Johnny or Dan you can say I'm totally wrong but basically on
00:28:25,00:28:29,February 17th 2017 a guy called Brandon Gonzalez
00:28:29,00:28:33,performed a stationary manual that lasted two hours and 55 minutes and now I
00:28:33,00:28:37,obviously had to look up where that was but it's just standing it's just
00:28:37,00:28:41,standing on your skateboard right no with one foot in the air and one foot on
00:28:41,00:28:45,the ground no but the but the the tail can't touch the
00:28:45,00:28:48,ground oh can it not so it's a balance act you
00:28:48,00:28:51,would be balancing I didn't see that from the picture
00:28:51,00:28:58,on the two back wheels doing her 27th hour standing on a skateboard come on
00:28:58,00:29:01,guys I'm absolutely smashing this it's so
00:29:01,00:29:04,easy but Guinness adjudicated going behind her going oh
00:29:04,00:29:09,shit I didn't see okay no I got this wrong man okay I take that back I'm
00:29:09,00:29:13,sorry okay yeah no is the answer we cannot
00:29:13,00:29:20,break that one
00:29:20,00:29:26,okay it is time for fact number three that is Anna my fact this week is that
00:29:26,00:29:32,when Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier he brought 220 gallons of alcohol on the
00:29:32,00:29:37,flight with him nice I've done a trick in us Anna I've
00:29:37,00:29:41,done a trick but I found this so surprising
00:29:41,00:29:45,so Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in 1947
00:29:45,00:29:52,in the bell x1 plane and the fuel it used was alcohol
00:29:52,00:29:56,like it was just a huge tank of alcohol so it was burning liquid oxygen and then
00:29:56,00:29:59,a mixture of five parts alcohol to one part
00:29:59,00:30:03,water which seems incredibly weird and is not something that
00:30:03,00:30:06,like occasionally you talk about alcohol fuel there are jokes that Prince
00:30:06,00:30:10,Charles runs his cars off wine there are certain places that
00:30:10,00:30:15,use ethanol in their vehicles but it doesn't seem that ordinary but it seems
00:30:15,00:30:19,like yeah he ran them off ethanol I imagine it's quite dangerous
00:30:19,00:30:22,I suppose you wouldn't want to drop a drop a lit match in there
00:30:22,00:30:26,but then you wouldn't want to win any of it and you wouldn't want to drink it
00:30:26,00:30:29,halfway through the flight either yeah multiple if you distill it through a
00:30:29,00:30:32,sock it's probably safe because I think that's what people in prison do with
00:30:32,00:30:35,rubbing alcohol they distill it through their sock and then
00:30:35,00:30:39,but hey kids don't do that you know because but you know if you're desperate
00:30:39,00:30:44,if you've run out of wine yeah yeah was that fuel for all the p-51 bombers at the
00:30:44,00:30:47,time um I'm not sure I know it was fuel for the
00:30:47,00:30:52,flights that he flew over that time period yeah I don't think he will have been
00:30:52,00:30:55,I think because this was a very experimental plane right yeah yeah it
00:30:55,00:30:58,was flying it was more modeled on a rocket I think
00:30:58,00:31:02,and he nicknamed it sweetly the glamorous glenus
00:31:02,00:31:05,after his fiance who was called glenus fade dickhouse I know thank god he didn't
00:31:05,00:31:09,go for the surname we mentioned our product is a production
00:31:09,00:31:12,company no really yeah that's our production
00:31:12,00:31:15,companies come off it no way they're not the glenus
00:31:15,00:31:20,well no no it just uh that was a coincidence
00:31:20,00:31:24,yeah and it was sweet but I remember I was reading
00:31:24,00:31:30,a book about Chuck Yeager and to woo his wife he said stick with me honey and
00:31:30,00:31:33,you'll be farting through silk
00:31:33,00:31:36,had a real way with words Chuck Yeager
00:31:36,00:31:40,nice the the night before he broke the sound barrier this is
00:31:40,00:31:43,widely known he he had broke his ribs in a horse riding accident
00:31:43,00:31:48,and the doctor who is rumored to have patched him up
00:31:48,00:31:52,was this man colonel John Paul Stapp now
00:31:52,00:32:00,he was a physician flight surgeon and led some of the most groundbreaking
00:32:00,00:32:06,experiments on deceleration uh it was like the late 40s to mid 50s
00:32:06,00:32:10,and they were trying to determine what it was like for pilots to
00:32:10,00:32:16,eject at high altitudes and also what they can withstand in a plane crash
00:32:16,00:32:20,so they thought a person could only withstand 18 g's
00:32:20,00:32:24,of force and a g is like the amount of force the earth's
00:32:24,00:32:27,gravitational field exerts on human body when you're standing
00:32:27,00:32:31,still anyway they thought they could only withstand 18 g's
00:32:31,00:32:36,and he knew that was wrong because being a flight surgeon he could look at the
00:32:36,00:32:39,crash records and see that these pilots had
00:32:39,00:32:42,was stood more than that but the plane had failed
00:32:42,00:32:46,so he did all these experiments and one was
00:32:46,00:32:49,they had this rocket sled and he would strap himself to it
00:32:49,00:32:55,and he would go up to speeds which eventually reached 630 miles an hour
00:32:55,00:33:02,and stop within 1.5 seconds oh yeah it's not safe
00:33:02,00:33:06,no and 630 miles an hour by the way was faster than
00:33:06,00:33:10,a speeding bullet at that time wow and come to a complete stop
00:33:10,00:33:13,and i think the last time he did it he experienced
00:33:13,00:33:21,46.2 g's wow and he went temporarily blind afterwards
00:33:21,00:33:24,and not only that not only did he go temporarily blind
00:33:24,00:33:28,but he ended up with two black eyes because when he stopped
00:33:28,00:33:32,his eyes shot forward into his socket so hard
00:33:32,00:33:35,like somebody sees Jessica Rabbit yeah exactly
00:33:35,00:33:38,they went blank and he ended up with black eyes and
00:33:38,00:33:42,prior to doing it he was so sure that this blindness would happen
00:33:42,00:33:46,that he spent a lot of time in his room blindfolded and trying to work out how
00:33:46,00:33:49,to exist without sight anymore because he thought
00:33:49,00:33:52,that's what's going to happen that's so cool that's like being punched in the
00:33:52,00:33:55,face from the inside isn't it yeah inside your head
00:33:55,00:33:58,exactly but i think am i right that he broke the
00:33:58,00:34:02,land speed record i think he was known as the fastest man on earth
00:34:02,00:34:07,yeah time magazine did a bit he was on all the tv shows he was a huge star then
00:34:07,00:34:12,and now no one knows him yeah that's weird i read that
00:34:12,00:34:18,when he stopped for that instant his body weighed about 7700 pounds
00:34:18,00:34:22,what yeah um which is about the same as a white rhino
00:34:22,00:34:25,wow because your weight is your mass times the gravitational
00:34:25,00:34:29,but he did he didn't balloon to it did he no no it's just like
00:34:29,00:34:33,it's more of a mathematical thing really but yeah what a shame
00:34:33,00:34:36,he was trying to prove what humans could withstand but it feels like it's a loose
00:34:36,00:34:40,definition of withstand because yeah he went blind had black eyes he cracked
00:34:40,00:34:43,his ribs he broke his wrists his respiratory and
00:34:43,00:34:45,circulatory systems were really badly damaged
00:34:45,00:34:48,i mean you know there's withstand again there's um
00:34:48,00:34:52,living through in good health isn't there yeah there's what's standing and
00:34:52,00:34:57,there's a showing off yeah exactly there's a thin line between
00:34:57,00:35:01,a great guitar fill and a smart ass guitar player
00:35:01,00:35:06,he's i don't quite get that but i think i agree with it
00:35:06,00:35:10,he's also the reason by the way for the term murphy's law yeah we have murphy's
00:35:10,00:35:13,law because of him yeah because on on an experiment
00:35:13,00:35:17,that was done five years earlier where they're testing out the speeds it was
00:35:17,00:35:20,captain murphy who was part of the test and
00:35:20,00:35:23,afterwards when snap was utterly injured like
00:35:23,00:35:27,really broken murphy just kind of explained that anything that can go
00:35:27,00:35:30,wrong will go wrong in different words that became murphy's law
00:35:30,00:35:33,it needs an addendum anything that can go wrong will go wrong if you are working
00:35:33,00:35:37,with kernel john snap who doesn't mental shit
00:35:37,00:35:40,snap did nothing wrong he was just the passenger it was murphy
00:35:40,00:35:45,have you johnny i i imagine within the uh the world of jackass that you've
00:35:45,00:35:49,done a few things testing the pull of gravity um
00:35:49,00:35:53,well gravity is the funniest comedian of all time
00:35:53,00:36:00,and in my opinion i never reached a speed of 630 miles an hour on anything
00:36:00,00:36:06,but yeah gravity did play a part that in newton's third law of motion
00:36:06,00:36:09,without those two things i'd have no career
00:36:10,00:36:15,thank god for physics yes thank god that's so good you know snap is also
00:36:15,00:36:18,the reason we have uh seatbelts in cars
00:36:18,00:36:22,now yeah he was also testing restraint systems
00:36:22,00:36:27,and finally got the air force to listen when he explained that we're losing
00:36:27,00:36:30,more pilots on the ground than we are in the air
00:36:30,00:36:35,and there's a snap car crash conference that he founded i think still goes on
00:36:35,00:36:39,today so wow what a good guy
00:36:39,00:36:42,yeah should we talk a bit more about chart keager oh yeah yeah
00:36:42,00:36:45,please um he was really hardcore another really
00:36:45,00:36:48,hardcore one along with those country artists in world war two
00:36:48,00:36:52,he um distinguished himself by being just amazing at dog fighting
00:36:52,00:36:57,basically didn't hear and he loved it um so great in a plane but he
00:36:57,00:37:00,had this episode i didn't know about where he was shot down over france
00:37:00,00:37:04,and so he has to bail out with his parachute and he said he could see
00:37:04,00:37:08,german soldiers all over the ground below but luckily he landed
00:37:08,00:37:12,in a forest uh but this meant that he had to climb over the mountains to cross
00:37:12,00:37:16,the border to get into safe territory and so he's like knee deep in snow he's
00:37:16,00:37:20,had to bail out of his plane he's with a comrade
00:37:20,00:37:24,and they almost get caught and have a really awful scrape when they find a
00:37:24,00:37:28,hut to sleep in and the guy he's with leaves his socks
00:37:28,00:37:33,outside the cabin to dry which i'd be so pissed off about
00:37:33,00:37:37,german soldiers came past how did they be distilling their alcohol
00:37:37,00:37:42,if he's a good point that's oh wow so yeah the
00:37:42,00:37:45,Germans came past and they started shooting at them so then they leap out
00:37:45,00:37:48,the window and his navigator who's the guy with him
00:37:48,00:37:52,is badly shot but then an incredibly cool thing i think this is what happened
00:37:52,00:37:56,they both jumped onto or chuck basically carried his badly injured
00:37:56,00:37:59,navigator onto a log slide which i think must have
00:37:59,00:38:04,just been one of those log flumes that they used to carry logs down mountains
00:38:04,00:38:08,and they cascaded down the mountain on this log side to escape
00:38:08,00:38:12,he then amputates his friend's leg with a pen knife
00:38:12,00:38:15,yeah just out of anger because he's so pissed off with him
00:38:15,00:38:19,that's one less sock you'll need
00:38:19,00:38:24,but yeah then he takes his leg off and then he leaves him by the side of the
00:38:24,00:38:28,road says bye and fortunately he's rescued and
00:38:28,00:38:31,saved but i mean jager didn't know that jager just
00:38:31,00:38:35,left a legless man on the side of the road and yeah he had one leg he didn't
00:38:35,00:38:38,he didn't take both his legs off you gotta make some hard decisions
00:38:38,00:38:41,yeah yeah he got picked up by the resistance and
00:38:41,00:38:45,at the time if you spent time with the resistance and got back to america you
00:38:45,00:38:50,were no longer allowed to fly again because if
00:38:50,00:38:54,you got shot down again you may give up the resistance
00:38:54,00:38:59,but he went to washington and lobbied to i don't know what was washington but he
00:38:59,00:39:02,lobbied with a general and said look i want to go back
00:39:02,00:39:07,if i get caught i won't say a word and i think he was the first person to be
00:39:07,00:39:09,allowed to fly again after being captured
00:39:09,00:39:13,wow this is jager right yeah when he was young this was way before he was
00:39:13,00:39:17,chuck jager this was just just a hard-ass kid
00:39:17,00:39:20,because then when he was doing that all of his flying
00:39:20,00:39:24,afterwards by all rights he should have been one of the first astronauts right
00:39:24,00:39:28,you would have expected him to be like he couldn't get in because he didn't have a
00:39:28,00:39:31,degree and i get the feeling that that really pissed
00:39:31,00:39:33,him off for pretty much his whole life after that
00:39:33,00:39:37,yeah impression it's interesting there's it's a big role
00:39:37,00:39:41,in the movie the right stuff which was a book by tom wolf where you see him
00:39:41,00:39:45,sort of getting overlooked because he was the man you know he
00:39:45,00:39:48,yes he could do anything in the movie he kind of makes
00:39:48,00:39:51,pizza with it but yeah you get the impression that he should have been
00:39:51,00:39:57,there with neil on the moon wow widely recognizes the greatest natural pilot to
00:39:57,00:40:02,ever live he had 2010 vision yeah uses built for it
00:40:02,00:40:05,what is that because i thought 2020 was the best but it's clearly not right if
00:40:05,00:40:09,2010 is better anything that you can see from
00:40:09,00:40:12,10 meters he could see the same from 20 meters
00:40:12,00:40:16,okay so it's twice as good as you twice as good actually a lot more than that for
00:40:16,00:40:21,you but for a normal person yeah yeah i'm not a good
00:40:21,00:40:25,person to use of that um how interesting and he yeah
00:40:25,00:40:30,i mean bringing up the apollo astronauts um the glennis fey his wife
00:40:30,00:40:34,uh such a such a shame that the sound barrier wasn't broken in a plane called
00:40:34,00:40:39,the dick house that's such a shame but he named he named three of his
00:40:39,00:40:42,initial planes after her the glamorous glenn and then glennis
00:40:42,00:40:45,became a name afterwards and they were married until
00:40:45,00:40:50,his dying day and i think her dying day in fact sorry her dying day
00:40:50,00:40:54,um he died 2020 didn't he um i used to i used to follow him facebook i used to
00:40:54,00:40:59,get updates all the time from from chucky agar he was very active on facebook
00:40:59,00:41:03,was he yeah um but yeah that was rare all the apollo and mercury
00:41:03,00:41:07,astronauts ended in divorce multiple times and him and his wife were a unit
00:41:07,00:41:11,all the way to the end and in fact i think he used that when he was when
00:41:11,00:41:14,there was a discussing who's going to try and break the sound barrier who's
00:41:14,00:41:17,going to be our test pilot i think they said there was an argument that it
00:41:17,00:41:22,should be someone who was single and childless because then if they died
00:41:22,00:41:26,it didn't matter it was just one person and i think he argued no it's much
00:41:26,00:41:30,better to choose someone like me who's got a wife and a little boy who i love
00:41:30,00:41:35,because i'll be much more careful and uh so i'll make sure that i do
00:41:35,00:41:38,survive it it's an argument that worked for him so we don't need to interrogate
00:41:38,00:41:43,now fill her up with booze i'm going on a horse ride
00:41:43,00:41:48,yeah he did uh an experiment with kernel john paul staff as well uh they
00:41:48,00:41:53,did a wind blast experiment where they went up in a plane
00:41:53,00:41:58,without a canopy on it and reached speeds of over 500 miles an hour
00:41:58,00:42:01,and people were saying no don't do that you're going to be decapitated this or
00:42:01,00:42:05,that but you know they were fine decapitated by just the the them that
00:42:05,00:42:08,much the wind yeah how were they fine i'm really
00:42:08,00:42:12,surprised because i'm a story that is always told about me is when my mom was
00:42:12,00:42:16,driving the car when i was a baby and they had you know you had like a you've
00:42:16,00:42:20,got roof window what do you call it sunroof sunroof thank you um and
00:42:20,00:42:24,my dad was holding me and my mom was a very fast driver and my dad thought it
00:42:24,00:42:27,would be really funny to lift me up he was just holding me on his lap
00:42:27,00:42:31,lifted me up and put my head out the window and my mom said she's never been
00:42:31,00:42:34,so furious with him i mean in a way it was her fault for driving 100 miles an
00:42:34,00:42:39,hour along main road but um i think i i think it wasn't that fun for me as a
00:42:39,00:42:41,baby i'll be honest anna i don't think anyone
00:42:41,00:42:47,comes out well with that story i was an innocent victim
00:42:47,00:42:51,i can just see in the background johnny slightly going tell me those footage
00:42:51,00:42:54,that i could use in the future
00:42:54,00:43:02,oh yeah they survived it
00:43:02,00:43:06,okay it is time for our final fact of the show
00:43:06,00:43:10,and that is james okay my fact this week is that according to tradition
00:43:10,00:43:15,of the banner people of ethopia before a man can become a man
00:43:15,00:43:20,he has to learn how to walk on stilts
00:43:20,00:43:25,okay you know like i see i don't drive but i'm told that if i fail
00:43:25,00:43:28,the driving test enough times they just give it to you
00:43:28,00:43:33,is there like that's not true that's not true no no no all right i'll learn then
00:43:33,00:43:36,okay damn you're thinking how many times can you fall off the stilts before they
00:43:36,00:43:41,just go okay have your penis anywhere yeah exactly
00:43:41,00:43:45,i think they always have a penis it's just like their culture
00:43:45,00:43:50,has got like quite a complex level of age groups like you go from this age group
00:43:50,00:43:54,to this age group to this age group uh and to go from and actually this is true
00:43:54,00:43:58,of a lot of people around the world but to go from adolescence to manhud
00:43:58,00:44:03,they have a ceremony and part of that ceremony involves them having to strike
00:44:03,00:44:07,a balance on stilts and it's supposed to show that
00:44:07,00:44:12,you're strong minded independently willed confident
00:44:12,00:44:17,and ready to take on a wife okay it's what all women want
00:44:17,00:44:21,yeah man you can walk on stilts yeah i've walked on stilts before
00:44:21,00:44:25,it's pretty yeah yeah i've had i you know not
00:44:25,00:44:29,ginormously high ones but i would say four feet in the air at least
00:44:29,00:44:33,and that's high they're fine they're they're really easy to get used to
00:44:33,00:44:37,yeah straight away what was the context in which you're walking on stilts
00:44:37,00:44:42,i think i was at a house that just had a lot of um party gear and stilts were
00:44:42,00:44:46,part of the the gear and i just gave it a badge maybe you just have a natural
00:44:46,00:44:49,affinity to stilts wow yeah it can't be that easy
00:44:49,00:44:52,because people make a living from doing it so it can't be that well no but they
00:44:52,00:44:56,do more complicated things with it right like i'm just
00:44:56,00:45:01,yeah and they do it funny clothes and to be fair when i was watching a video of
00:45:01,00:45:04,these banner kids some kids on stilts and they mostly look like they're having
00:45:04,00:45:07,so much fun and they find it extremely entertaining which it would be
00:45:07,00:45:10,and also the interviewer says to one of these little kids who's just running
00:45:10,00:45:13,around on stilts so how long have you been doing this how long does it take to
00:45:13,00:45:17,get ready is it months years and the guys like i just started yesterday mate
00:45:17,00:45:21,it's i mean so maybe i think dan might be right i think like this is a piece of
00:45:21,00:45:24,cake you may be right and the idea was that the tribe would
00:45:24,00:45:28,traditionally use stilts to avoid wild animals and also you can see over the
00:45:28,00:45:30,savannah yes absolutely because actually there's
00:45:30,00:45:34,a tradition in europe of shepherds using stilts for the same reason
00:45:34,00:45:38,because you can get much higher up and you can see where all your sheep's are
00:45:38,00:45:42,and stuff like that is this the landis region it's over quite a lot of Europe
00:45:42,00:45:45,yeah the landis especially the landis in southwestern france this is amazing
00:45:45,00:45:49,they basically everyone in this town existed on stilts but it largely was
00:45:49,00:45:52,the farmers and exactly it was for that you would you would be on your stilts so
00:45:52,00:45:55,that you could see where all your sheep where it was also very
00:45:55,00:45:59,mushy and muddy in the ground and so it was very useful to get around by
00:45:59,00:46:02,standing on the stilt you had a big stick
00:46:02,00:46:06,which was what you would use to what's the word for when you're
00:46:06,00:46:09,getting the sheep into shepherd yeah you'd shepherd them with your big old
00:46:09,00:46:12,hood and but you would then use the big stick as a
00:46:12,00:46:16,seat so you like a tripod so you'd place your bum on it and they would just do
00:46:16,00:46:19,their knitting all day long would they yeah
00:46:19,00:46:23,oh that's nice with their recently shorn sheep's wool presumably yeah
00:46:23,00:46:27,exactly do with it lovely yeah these the banner people it's
00:46:27,00:46:30,weird that they say it's to then escape predators
00:46:30,00:46:34,because they also paint their bodies in black and white stripes that do resemble
00:46:34,00:46:38,quite closely a zebra it came with them and i was offering tips
00:46:38,00:46:41,i feel like don't don't disguise yourself as a zebra
00:46:41,00:46:45,yeah that's true one of the other ceremonies that they do is when they're
00:46:45,00:46:49,just about to get married uh and that is a bull-weeping ceremony
00:46:49,00:46:54,so you line up a load of cows in a row and everyone has to run
00:46:54,00:46:58,and jump over the backs of four cows without falling
00:46:58,00:47:01,and if you can do that then you're allowed to get married whoa four cows
00:47:01,00:47:06,it's not for you know like it's not like evil keneval jumping over four at once
00:47:06,00:47:10,yeah jump over one like slight hurdles okay yeah yeah
00:47:10,00:47:15,well i think i'd like to see james jump over four at once
00:47:15,00:47:21,i'm really uh becoming focused on james doing his son i'm actually very
00:47:21,00:47:26,scared of cows so perfect yeah what else are you scared of james
00:47:26,00:47:34,oh commitment i'll make sure your wife doesn't listen to this episode then
00:47:34,00:47:37,when we were filming wild boys we came across a lot of
00:47:37,00:47:41,rite of passages for boys to become a man and they're a lot were quite
00:47:41,00:47:46,entertaining and one sent my friend chris ponies to the hospital
00:47:46,00:47:51,the satari moe tribe uh hope i'm pronouncing that right in brazil
00:47:51,00:47:58,they will go out in the jungle and gather up bullet ants which are one of the
00:47:58,00:48:02,worst stings in the uh insect kingdom it's like 30
00:48:02,00:48:06,times worse than a bee sting and they'll gather up all the bullet ants
00:48:06,00:48:11,and they'll weave them into a glove of leaves with their
00:48:11,00:48:15,stingers sticking out and to become a man you have to put
00:48:15,00:48:19,your hand in the glove of bullet ants for 10 minutes
00:48:19,00:48:25,and take it and steve olimpanius both did it and
00:48:25,00:48:28,there was most excruciating pain that that was it
00:48:28,00:48:32,they've endured yeah and that's a high bar for them in fact
00:48:32,00:48:36,wow yes more than that's good to know because i think we might have mentioned
00:48:36,00:48:39,bullet ants before and you know they're this extreme pain animal and sometimes
00:48:39,00:48:43,i think are they that painful or are they just kind of they've gained this
00:48:43,00:48:48,reputation but you can verify steve says hurts a lot
00:48:48,00:48:52,yeah dude yeah um yeah ponies had to go to the hospital
00:48:52,00:48:55,because he had an allergic reaction anytime he gets stung by anything he
00:48:55,00:48:58,has to go to the hospital um i was looking up just i was just
00:48:58,00:49:03,googling around with the word stilt and i discovered that one of the greatest
00:49:03,00:49:06,early day basketball players had the nickname the stilt which was
00:49:06,00:49:12,wilt the stilt chamberlain which i i had no idea about yeah so wilt chamberlain
00:49:12,00:49:15,very famously scored a hundred points in a single game
00:49:15,00:49:20,he did free throws in that match underarm which we know is a better way of doing
00:49:20,00:49:24,three throws but we also know that basketball players think they look too
00:49:24,00:49:26,wimpy when they're doing it so they do it in the
00:49:26,00:49:30,overarm way instead he also is responsible for the fact
00:49:30,00:49:34,that when you take a shot at the foul line so ana i know
00:49:34,00:49:38,it's going to be hard to describe but this is a thing when you're
00:49:38,00:49:41,fouled you go when you get two shots in the basket in the key
00:49:41,00:49:45,and then then ana has just written a book about sport
00:49:45,00:49:48,it's called a lot of old balls the qi book of sport
00:49:48,00:49:52,it's available now in all good bug shops and she knows everything about wilt
00:49:52,00:49:54,chamberlain so you know all about this you shot yourself in the foot there down
00:49:54,00:49:58,if you didn't want us to mention it better better than in the mouth ana
00:49:58,00:50:04,so um where do you want it so yeah so um he's responsible for a major rule change
00:50:04,00:50:08,within basketball as well which is the fact that when he used to shoot at the
00:50:08,00:50:11,foul line he's six for eleven he would jump and
00:50:11,00:50:15,dunk it and that's not allowed anymore so they said you have to remain behind
00:50:15,00:50:17,the foul line but the stilt thing is really
00:50:17,00:50:21,interesting in his name wilt the stilt chamberlain because
00:50:21,00:50:25,everyone called him it it was the nickname that was used in every paper
00:50:25,00:50:29,and magazine and he hated it it was given to him in the early days and when
00:50:29,00:50:32,people were on his team were playing on a opposing team their their coaches
00:50:32,00:50:36,would be like don't call him the stilt he'll go nuts he's he's really upset
00:50:36,00:50:38,why didn't he hate it what's wrong with the stilt it's not they called him wilt
00:50:38,00:50:42,the asshole he won't yeah i don't he will calm down
00:50:42,00:50:47,dickhouse chamberlain he well he could have been called that he
00:50:47,00:50:52,supposedly that's another story on yeah apparently 20 000 women were bedded by
00:50:52,00:50:58,wilt the stilt um he's sure they were but he loved the name the dipper or dippy
00:50:58,00:51:03,and he got it because as i said he was ginormous six foot 11 and it's got
00:51:03,00:51:07,nothing to do with basketball it was one day he kept walking into doorways
00:51:07,00:51:11,because he's so tall and one doorway cracked him in the eyes
00:51:11,00:51:14,he got a black eye and they started calling him dippy because
00:51:14,00:51:18,they needed to remind him to dip down anytime he was heading out of doorway
00:51:18,00:51:22,and that's the name he loved but he was wilt the stilt to the end well i had to
00:51:22,00:51:27,say wilt the stilt it's a little snappier yeah yeah yeah it is
00:51:27,00:51:31,and cool and you can't make your own nicknames guys so
00:51:31,00:51:34,get over that yeah well big dick james harkin
00:51:34,00:51:44,says different it's like a walking stick full of bagels
00:51:44,00:51:48,i think the tallest stilt walk in history it certainly claims to be
00:51:48,00:51:51,speaking of people who make their own nicknames a guy called roi maloy
00:51:51,00:51:58,which bit is the nickname in roi maloy yeah i think
00:51:58,00:52:02,it's not even a good one i just think he wasn't born roi maloy
00:52:02,00:52:06,i think that might be a you know to make his name rhyme maybe it doesn't even
00:52:06,00:52:09,qualify as a nickname all right he's like a nom de plume
00:52:09,00:52:15,a nom de plume exactly thank you so he's set a bunch of world records for world
00:52:15,00:52:19,records and in 2008 he set the unverified world
00:52:19,00:52:22,record for the tallest stilts walk ever but i was looking up i
00:52:22,00:52:26,again i i know i keep making wild claims but i think we can break this one too
00:52:26,00:52:30,um johnny you could definitely do this surely you've done something similar to
00:52:30,00:52:36,this because it was 17 meter high stilts which is high that's like
00:52:36,00:52:39,five stories yeah there you go for all the yanks
00:52:39,00:52:43,there you go for the yanks um and he had to mount them by going up to the fifth
00:52:43,00:52:47,story of a building and lean the stilts next to the building and then he mounts
00:52:47,00:52:50,them from there wow but then it's a little bit like
00:52:50,00:52:54,if you're teaching a baby to walk he's got his helpers you can just see their
00:52:54,00:52:58,hands in the video and he's clinging onto their hands and then he just let's go
00:52:58,00:53:01,for a second does a really quick bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop one two three
00:53:01,00:53:05,four five on the spot on the stilts and then falls back into their arms again
00:53:05,00:53:08,and says that's the tallest stilts walk in history
00:53:08,00:53:12,i don't think that counts i don't think it counts either i think you've got to get
00:53:12,00:53:15,from a to b and they need to be in different places
00:53:15,00:53:20,did they hand him his penis after you're now a man
00:53:20,00:53:25,17 meter penis have you not ever walked on stilts johnny it seems like the kind
00:53:25,00:53:29,of thing that jackass would have done some kind of still walking stunts i can
00:53:29,00:53:34,barely walk on my own two feet which really helped me in stunts
00:53:34,00:53:40,but steve o was a clown when we initially hired him he worked at a carnival
00:53:40,00:53:44,a circus inside of a swap meet in florida it was bleak
00:53:44,00:53:51,so he did a lot of stunt walking and we we did one or two things with stilts but
00:53:51,00:53:55,they're nice to look at but you need a little blunt force trauma
00:53:55,00:54:00,to to make something watchable sure well you can still walk into a into a wall if
00:54:00,00:54:03,you want yeah but yeah do you know i'm
00:54:03,00:54:06,something interesting i haven't actually got the research on this i just this is
00:54:06,00:54:10,something i remember is that with stilt walking
00:54:10,00:54:13,there was a person who had cerebral palsy and found that their walking was
00:54:13,00:54:16,better when they were on stilts it helped to improve them
00:54:16,00:54:20,in some respects with their gait and how they're walking and michael j fox
00:54:20,00:54:23,also talks about that when he goes ice skating it really
00:54:23,00:54:27,causes the tremors that he has to sort of mellow down and rest a bit
00:54:27,00:54:31,interesting interesting i wonder the medical benefits of i'm not suggesting
00:54:31,00:54:35,that everyone be just ice skating and on stilts if there no ice skating on
00:54:35,00:54:39,stilts i love it there you go that's how you get the blunt trauma
00:54:39,00:54:42,yeah yeah harkin stunt there we go yeah
