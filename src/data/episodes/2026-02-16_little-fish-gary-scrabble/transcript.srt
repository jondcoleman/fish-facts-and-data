00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,460
 Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of Little Fish, the show when we look at your amazing

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,880
 facts that you've been sending to podcast@QI.com and he has whittled them away to the very,

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,980
 very cream of the crop and then we pick out the plums, mix all our metaphors and just chat about facts.

5
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,680
 So who's got a fact? I've got one to kick off. Yeah, this is a fun one. This comes from Daniel

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:44,440
 Hamer and it's about the island of Kiribas. Yeah. Oh yeah. Islander Islands. It's Islands. The Islands.

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,800
 Apologies. It's starting with an apology now. I'm sorry to the people on the other islands of

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,160
 Kiribas apart from the big one, which is the one I was thinking of. Okay. Daniel's Fact is the word for

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:03,400
 dog in Kiribas is Kamea, right? Okay. And that is because it's a bastardisation of English derived

10
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,880
 from the time dogs were introduced to the English and locals heard the English calling to the dogs. Kamea!

11
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:16,200
 Kamea! Really? Yeah, that's interesting. Is that true? No, Kamea. That's a different breed. Well,

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,680
 I just I looked up the language a little bit and it's called Gilbertese as well. Yeah, because it's

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,920
 the Gilbert Islands, but it's Kiribas is how you write it. Gilbert. It's so strange. Yeah, they were

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:34,680
 called Les Il-Gilbert and Kiribas kind of derived from Gilbert, Kiribas. So you can sort of see how it

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,880
 happens. But previously they were known to Western visitors as the King's Mill Islands. Okay. After the

16
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:47,240
 bread. After the bread. Wow. Yeah. Very nice. I go on here. Go on, Dan. This was sent in by

17
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,240
 Arthur Wallapot, who has added in brackets an internet name. Thank you for the clarification.

18
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,800
 Arthur Wallapot, who says that there is a species of Chinese ground spider whose technical name is

19
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:08,440
 Hot Wheels Sisyphus. Okay, so Hot Wheels has in the little toy cars. Yeah, is it? Yeah, and Sisyphus

20
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,280
 has in the Greek guy who pushed the boulder up there. Exactly, yeah. And yeah, it was discovered in China

21
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,800
 and just the nature of how the spider moved reminded them of Hot Wheels basically. And so they gave

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,720
 them this name. I wonder which will stand the test of time for longer. The story of Sisyphus,

23
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,320
 the ancient 2000 year old tale of the guy being punished for all eternity or the Hot Wheels

24
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,040
 bread. Hot Wheels, the ones where you pull them backwards 10 times and then let go and they go

25
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,760
 really fast. Maybe. I don't know. Yeah, I'm not sure. They probably are within the Hot Wheels world.

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,960
 They are also just small cars and you get those big plastic loops that you can send them around.

27
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,120
 With the loops. Yeah, exactly. Sisyphus had to push his boulder around the loop the loop.

28
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,080
 That was probably level two if he ever got to it, which he never did. Because I think that's worse

29
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,320
 in a way, because when you get to the top of the loop the loop you have this amazingly satisfying

30
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,240
 moment where you can roll all the way back down the other side. Yeah. But if he never quite

31
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,960
 reached there is even worse than I've been to the hill where he allegedly pushed the boulder.

32
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,040
 How do you? Yeah, it's in Greece. And what do you think? Could you have? Do you love it?

33
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:19,720
 No, I couldn't. It's not that it's not that high. It's just outside of a city whose name I can't

34
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,000
 remember near the Peloponese. Okay. And it's as you're in the town you can see this big hill and

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,600
 the locals say that's where he pushed it. Did you say allegedly because Sisyphus is famously

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:39,720
 litigious? He'll see you and then tomorrow he'll see you again. I suppose that didn't mean

37
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,400
 allegedly. I meant according to legend. According to legendarily. Yeah. Hey, this is interesting.

38
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,360
 Hot Wheels. Do you know who invented Hot Wheels? Someone who's famous for making

39
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,760
 maxi-sized cars. No, right. Someone who's famous for toys. Okay, okay. We can get this. A

40
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:04,120
 famous toy person. I don't know. Rubik. Lovely. I'm excited to know that you know who the inventor

41
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,440
 Rubik cubes are as your first go to. How many other toy makers? I don't know. I don't know. Ed,

42
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:21,560
 would yo-yo. Gary Scrabble. What's the name? Melissa, who did Barbie? There we go. She was called

43
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,680
 Ruth Handler. Ruth Handler. Hot Wheels is invented by a husband, is a door Elliot Handler. He created

44
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,480
 Hot Wheels. He created creepy crawlers. He created chatty Kathy. These were all massive in their day.

45
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,680
 Sure. Yeah. They were. Absolutely. And I'm sure someone is right now stripped of mining the

46
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,440
 intellectual property to drive desperately turn out another Barbie-level movie. Sun Chatty Kathy.

47
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,120
 That is happening. Chatty Kathy was one of the pioneers of pulling back a string

48
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,360
 and having a voice to come out. Yeah. Someone who's just like the doll being a pie. This is a funny idea.

49
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,240
 That's all right. Yeah. Very cool history. Okay. I've got a fact here from Mira Brown.

50
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:04,360
 A Mira wrote in from Canada and they said that Jack Daniels has become a bellweather of Canada

51
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,960
 US relations. Okay. So there have been- if you've been following the news, Donald Trump has been

52
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,160
 calling Canada the 51st state and been pointing lots of tariffs on. And so there's been a lot of

53
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:22,840
 buy cuts in Canada of American goods and especially of alcohol and especially of Jack Daniels.

54
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:32,040
 And I want you to guess what the percentage drop in sales in Canada of Jack Daniels has been

55
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,640
 in the last month or so. And because I know you two are going to mess up this quiz like you always

56
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,360
 doing bet like a billion percent or something. I'm going to put a prize on the line. So I've been to

57
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,880
 the shop and bought some whiskey. Oh, wow. So the winner. Probably whiskey or Jack Daniels.

58
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:55,000
 I put good whiskey. So I'm so annoyed because I do the emails and I did not pay any attention.

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,080
 So what percentage of sales down since Trump and Canada got into. By the way James,

60
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,440
 this is an amazing incentive structure you've put all the time in here. It's fantastic. I

61
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,560
 should know this because I have been to the Jack Daniels distillery as I've probably mentioned

62
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,760
 before. I've been to Tennessee in the last month. No, during like geopolitically calmer times.

63
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,800
 Right. But they call you up when there's been a change in sales numbers. 2008. I'm probably on the

64
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:30,600
 mailing list. Who's going to go first? Okay. I will say 72% drop. Drop. Okay. I'm going to say

65
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:37,960
 whiskey on the line. 0.5%. Not even 1%. 0.5%. Wow. Oh, wow. You don't like whiskey there,

66
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,480
 I suppose. Well, I still could be closer to Andy's. Yeah. Yeah. If you're anything under what,

67
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:52,680
 36% yeah. I'm afraid. Done. The answer is 62%. Oh, so Andy's there. You get your whiskey.

68
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:59,160
 There you go. Very nice. Now, oh, this is lovely. It's really nice, isn't it? Open it up. Yeah.

69
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,000
 What is it? It is to do with my facts that I'm about to tell you. Oh, yeah. This is like

70
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,240
 inception. This is amazing. It's called Uncle Nearest. Uncle Nearest.

71
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,760
 Uncle Nearest. Oh, and it's from Tennessee. Lovely. Yes. So it is named after nearest green.

72
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:20,840
 And nearest green was born into slavery and emancipated after civil war. And he was the guy who

73
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:29,400
 taught distilling to Jack Daniel of Jack Daniels fame. And the company Uncle Nearest Incorporated

74
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,400
 created this whiskey. We're not advertised by these guys. I just went to shop and got it.

75
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:41,720
 They created this whiskey in his honor. And Uncle Nearest Whiskey, their master blender is Victoria

76
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:48,120
 Edie Butler, a descendant of nearest green. And the first known African American female whiskey

77
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,560
 master blender. Cool. That's terrific. There you go. Thank you very much, James. Beautiful. I'm

78
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,360
 actually getting to the end of a bottle of American whiskey right now. Yeah. Yeah. I currently

79
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,600
 don't drink. So this is perfect. Oh, and that's perfect. Yeah. James, you've just given me a prize.

80
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,760
 And I'm afraid I'm about to not return the favour because this is the fact you won't like basically.

81
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,040
 But it's that. And this fact comes from Jay Bagley. The majority of the world's citric acid,

82
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,640
 which is added to so much of our food, is derived from industrial vats of black mold in China.

83
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:23,080
 I know James, you're not a fungus person. I'm allergic to black mold. Oh.

84
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,080
 As in, I did an allergy test and there was like two or three things and that was one of the main ones.

85
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:33,080
 I think everyone's. I don't think it's good for anyone. I thrive on it. Okay. Well,

86
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,200
 this stuff is safe. So I'm sure you guys have heard of citric acid. Yeah. It's in lemons.

87
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,280
 It's in lemons. It's often 8% of the dry weight of a citrus fruit, just to give you an idea of

88
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:50,120
 what's going on inside the lemons. But citric acid is incredibly useful for all sorts of purposes

89
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,400
 and all sorts of foods. And it's in so much stuff. It's in ketchup. It's in fizzy drinks. It's in

90
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,360
 tubal vitamins. It cleans your cattle sometimes. If you know there's lime scale things,

91
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,240
 you drop in your cattle, they can be they can be citric acid. It's used to improve the solubility

92
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,600
 of brown heroin. I knew I knew it for some time. You are all the drink at the moment, but you

93
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:18,680
 unfortunately. And if you can guess the percentage of citric acid. And basically, so you can't

94
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,760
 get it in fruit, but it's a real pain to extract it from fruit. And the world makes two million

95
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,800
 tons of it. Does does that mean heroin contains vitamin C? Yes. I think it probably does.

96
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,000
 Okay. As I keep telling my doctor, how much would you have to take to get your recommended

97
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,560
 daily allowance? Well, the good thing is it's more ash. So, you know, even if you only have a

98
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,200
 little bit, you know, you'll be at you'll be at a level soon enough. But basically, there's this

99
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,120
 fungus called aspergillus nigia, which causes black mold on grapes and apricots. And that is

100
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,000
 the more that you can synthesize and use to grow and create citric acid. And it's really safe.

101
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,480
 It's approved and everything. But genuinely, two million tons a year, if every person,

102
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,840
 if we were sharing it equally between us, that's 250 grams, give or take per person per year,

103
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,160
 and that we're getting through. Is that a lot? It will probably be a lot more in one go.

104
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,640
 Yeah. That's probably a reason we don't do that. What percentage is it in a citrus fruit,

105
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:21,080
 did you say? About eight. Okay. And it was 250 grams. Yeah. So, multiplied by 12 and a half times of

106
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,080
 that would be about three kilograms, just over three kilograms each of dried citrus fruits.

107
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,120
 Dried citrus fruits. That's very important. You could directly leave those leavens in the sun.

108
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:39,080
 Yeah. Very good. Very good. Nice. I go on here from John McComb, who writes that Disney has a

109
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:44,760
 now closed airport where the runway plays when you wish upon a star, when a plane lands, and goes

110
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:51,080
 over it at 45 miles an hour. That's incredible. Which Disney? We're talking Florida here. Florida.

111
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:58,600
 Yeah. So this was built in 1970 or 1971. No one's actually too sure. And the idea would be

112
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,760
 probably they just did it in December, January. That's probably a spill over a month to the new year.

113
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:11,240
 That's true. So yeah, so this was built and it was largely used for the official Disney plane

114
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,680
 called Mickey Mouse 1. When Walt Disney was alive, he had Mickey Mouse 1, the original plane.

115
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,520
 Like Air Force 1. Like Air Force 1. And it was so that he could go scouting for locations

116
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,400
 for possible future Disneyland properties. It was so that he could continue his meetings.

117
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,280
 Okay. Just quick pitch. Yeah. Quick pitch. The president is visiting Disneyland, right?

118
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,000
 Yeah. But then there's some kind of attack, some baddies attack, and the president has to flee

119
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,200
 on Mickey Mouse 1. Yes. Yeah. Uh-huh. And what then like a load of Walt Disney characters in all

120
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,680
 of their outfits, accidentally get into Air Force 1. That's it. That's it. That's it. And they've

121
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,240
 got the nuclear football and all of that. Yeah. And Goofy's trying to work it out. Yeah.

122
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,640
 And he had some foreign president going, who's running this country Mickey Mouse?

123
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,840
 Which is a famous thing you would say. Yeah. We'll have a script edit, of course. Of course.

124
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,240
 But you've done all the main work, I feel. So anyway, yeah. So it's not used. It's not used

125
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,480
 largely because they've built stuff too near to it. There's a monorail that means that if a plane

126
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,600
 did come in, it would possibly crash into it. So it's largely used as a parking area now. So it's

127
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,240
 still there and the strip with the music is still there. So if cars go over it, you can still get

128
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,920
 when you wish upon a star. Because I thought from the email that it was in a whole abandoned

129
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,160
 Disney park that just wasn't in use anymore and had kind of been overgrown, I was getting a bit

130
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:37,560
 sort of excited about that concept. Interesting. Cool fact. Here is a fact. This one is from

131
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:46,680
 Maxine Iglich. And Maxine says that Slovenia harnesses the power of ASMR to attract tourists.

132
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:53,880
 So Maxine was on the Slovenia official website for visa information. And they stumbled upon this

133
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:00,520
 page called the Sounds of Slovenia. And it's amazing. It's just a load of embedded audio clips

134
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:08,200
 of the sounds of Slovenia. They have bobbin lace making, big foot, Dan. I love it.

135
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:15,240
 A train, Sandy. Great. Yeah. No golf, unfortunately. But yeah, it's just a place where you can hear

136
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,960
 what Slovenia is like. That's great. I've actually been to Slovenia. I didn't hear a single bobbin

137
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:25,400
 lace being made. No, I have two have been there and I didn't see a single big foot. No.

138
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:31,240
 As far as I can see, big foot isn't a thing that's associated with Slovenia. No. I'm not trying to

139
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,200
 think of what my sound of Slovenia was. And I think it was the crunch as the higher car we had rented

140
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,080
 scraped along the side of an underground parking garage. And what would turn out to be an incredibly

141
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:49,080
 expensive moment for me. They do have that. It just says crunch crunch. This is going to be

142
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:57,080
 600 euros. So I was looking at Bigfoot in Slovenia to see what they're talking about. And it doesn't

143
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:04,360
 seem to exist, but there is a thing as in so many places. Imagine James solved Bigfoot. There he is.

144
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,560
 No, actually, that's the one place you'd hide if you were Bigfoot. You'd go to a country

145
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,160
 which didn't have a Bigfoot myth. That's perfect. Yeah. They have a thing called Leshi,

146
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,280
 which is like Slavic in general, but they have it in Slovenia. And I was reading the Wikipedia of

147
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:25,000
 this sort of Bigfoot like thing that lives in Slovenia. And apparently it has green eyes or white eyes

148
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,920
 or blue eyes. It has no eyebrows, although sometimes it's some stories it has eyebrows.

149
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:37,000
 In some stories, it's described like a giant, but some stories it's described as a small person. And

150
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 sometimes he's of average height. And he wears a wide-brimmed hat or a pointed cap or has no headwear.

151
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,200
 This dad is nodding along like this as I thought. Well, there's, I mean, there are species. It's not

152
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,600
 just one of them. So they're going to have different fashions. Some will suit a hat, some won't.

153
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:59,720
 You know, when I went to Slovenia last, one thing that was quite interesting, as we stayed in

154
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,560
 there like a hotel in the village, I was with my wife. And the bed had a bundling board in it.

155
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:11,160
 What's a bundle of bread? I'll tell you, you won't know these, but with not with your number of

156
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,360
 children. But it's a board you put down the middle of a bed to prevent any... hanky-panky.

157
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,560
 Yeah, between a man and a woman sharing a bed. So the idea is like in rural America, they would like

158
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,760
 allow a couple to sleep together before they were married, but to make sure that they didn't do

159
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,920
 anything naughty, they would put this board in between. And I went to this hotel and it had a board.

160
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:37,080
 Did you bring down a reception? Could we borrow a drill, please? No, small bit is fine.

161
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:49,640
 This is a great one. It's from Nathan Sheer and it's that the Duke of Wellington was two hours late

162
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,920
 to his own funeral. Okay. What does the thing you say about people sometimes, isn't it? He'd be

163
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,880
 late to his own funeral. Yeah, we did a fact, Elizabeth Taylor actively organised to be late to her

164
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:06,680
 own funeral. Yeah. And she was two or three different outfits. Did she? Yeah, so really. I've

165
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:13,080
 forgotten that. Anyway, basically 1852. This was the last, I'd say, mega funeral for many years,

166
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,600
 until probably I mean Queen Victoria, 1901 or maybe Winston Churchill, 1965. It was a big deal,

167
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,480
 because it was obviously a big deal. And basically, they made this mad steam punk carriage to

168
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,560
 transport him through the city. It was modeled after ancient descriptions of Alexander the Great's

169
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:39,000
 funeral carriage. Wow. I know. It was eight metres long, five metres high. It weighed 12 tons. It

170
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,120
 took six iron foundries to make this thing, like weeks and weeks, a dozen horses to pull. Unfortunately,

171
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:53,640
 what this all meant was that when it got stuck, it was a complete bastard to free. It took 60

172
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,520
 policemen when one wheel got stuck to lift this thing up and get it back on the road. And the

173
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,760
 horses were absolutely exhausted. A group of sailors had to help give it a push at one point.

174
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,400
 What were they doing there? I suppose, what were they doing there? They were just watching.

175
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,000
 There were reps of all the armed forces there, and so I suppose you'd have a team of sailors

176
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 following the thing. But there were 1.5 million people on the route, the funeral route.

177
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,080
 Wow. And think of the year, 1852, like the population was way lower at the time. Do you know what

178
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:31,560
 the biggest funeral of all time was? Gandhi. Very close. Jesus, never. Probably closer than

179
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,760
 Gandhi, I think. Unfortunately, someone you've never heard of, so that's a problem. It's Anna.

180
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:46,040
 Anna. Did you just get it? I'm not Anna. She never takes back, so I thought it was normal.

181
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:52,440
 You've been on three dots for six months. It's Anna. I've forgotten her name, basically, is an Indian

182
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,240
 politician. I think you might have been deputy prime minister or something like that. I met someone

183
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:07,640
 recently. She's Indian, and she had at her wedding. 50,000 people. What? Catered? It was catered.

184
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,840
 Yeah. And you were on the invite to the evening, weren't you? I'm sorry. 50,000 number one.

185
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,000
 Can I have a, no, no plus one? That's no problem. That's no problem. I've come a long time. It's fine.

186
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,800
 Yes, I think she, she had political connections, and her family were in politics. And when you have

187
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,480
 a big politicians, even their children get married, it's traditional, but basically you invite everyone

188
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,560
 from the province or whatever it is. Yes, right. I'm just, I just googled the biggest funeral,

189
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:46,760
 and it was CN and Adurai in 1969 and 15 million people attended. Oh, wow. He was the chief minister

190
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,720
 of Tamil Nadu. Blimey. Did you know him? Well, no, let me neither.

191
00:18:51,720 --> 00:19:00,280
 Okay, that is enough of your facts as great as they are, and they were great. They're brilliant.

192
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:07,320
 Really enjoyed them. It is time to give custodianship over to some of our facts. So anyone who

193
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,840
 is a member of our Patreon at the top level, which is friend of the podcast becomes a custodian

194
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,680
 of a fact. And so, damn, why don't you kick us off with a new custodian? Yeah, okay. This is for

195
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:25,560
 Paul Kingham. Paul, we're on episode 29 of the podcast, and you are now the custodian of the fact

196
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:34,120
 that in the 19th century, you could be committed to an asylum for novel reading. Very good. So this was,

197
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,080
 this was records from West Virginia asylum in Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital,

198
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,080
 and other reasons we were told about in that episode for admission included being kicked in the

199
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:53,320
 head by a horse, bad whiskey, and imaginary female trouble was another one. Imaginary female trouble.

200
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,600
 Is it imaginary trouble from females, or is it imaginary female causing the trouble? Very good.

201
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,040
 I'd probably both, I would imagine. Yeah, either of them's going to get you lots. Yeah, absolutely. I can't

202
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:10,520
 hear the phrase kicked in the head by a horse without thinking of Brian Blessed. Do you know this Andy?

203
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:16,920
 It was the first time that I met Brian and James met him as well. He arrived to do museum

204
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,520
 curiosity, and we went to pick him up in the main reception, and he was sitting there with a giant

205
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:28,680
 blue head like the whole front of his face knows. It was his own head. He didn't have a giant blue

206
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,400
 head by his side. No, it was his own blue head, and he could see us clearly looking a bit worried,

207
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,440
 and said, "Don't be alarmed, old boy! Got kicked in the face by a horse!" And it happened that

208
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,120
 morning. Wow. Yeah, he was in his field, got kicked in the face by a horse, and then thought,

209
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,120
 better go do museum curiosity and came along. Was he impaired? I think. It was hard to tell.

210
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:58,280
 The horse is fucked. Never record that. Oh, fantastic. Okay, go on Andy, give us another one.

211
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,760
 This one goes out to Hannah Wilson. Congratulations, Hannah, because your fact, this is, I'd say,

212
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,440
 a hall of fame, is that the Greenland shark lives in cold water and can only swim at one mile an hour.

213
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:15,880
 Its main prey seals swim at two miles an hour. That was one of mine. I remember reading that

214
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,160
 and trying to calculate the speed at which the prey could escape. Does it sneak up?

215
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,320
 Yeah, I had to wait till they're sleeping, basically. Okay, here's another one. This one goes out to

216
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:34,360
 Ian Wolfe, an old friend of the podcast himself, and his fact is now that the head of the International

217
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:40,600
 Chess Federation believes that chess was brought to earth by aliens. That's right. This sounds

218
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:48,280
 like a damn thing, but it's not. It was mine. Obviously, I'm a big chess, not a big aliens fan, but I love

219
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:55,720
 my chess. He said that the aliens gave us two things, chess and sweet corn. With the gun to my head,

220
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,640
 I don't know which I would give up. Neither has neither plays a massive role in my life.

221
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:07,960
 I teach in my daughter how to play chess at the moment. I'm trying. Basically, she takes the horses

222
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:15,080
 and plays Rapunzel with them. You've got a tower for her to be up with the rug.

223
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,400
 Yeah, that's true. Yeah. You just need to work a bishop into the Rapunzel story.

224
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,440
 Yeah, because we have the King and Queen, King Fredric and Queen Aryan. Yeah, perfect.

225
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:31,400
 I'm not sure where Ponds come in. Yeah. Okay, down another one. Yep. This is a fact going out to

226
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,480
 Monique Julia to attract new members. The Japanese Yakuza crime syndicate has its own website

227
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:43,800
 and theme tune. I want to say I'm a big fan of the Yakuza. Well, we've talked about them a lot,

228
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:50,040
 haven't we, over the years. Friends of the podcast? No. Okay. They feature the fair bit. We've done

229
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:55,320
 their tattoos and their pinky thing as well. You have to lose half a little finger. And Halloween,

230
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,960
 they're very active during Halloween with kids and giving out sweets. That's true. Yeah. But they

231
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,600
 can't do the Adam's family theme tune because they can't click their fingers. Well, they've got a

232
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:10,920
 theme tune change. So they need to be very strong. Very strong. Don't even know what that means.

233
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,720
 Here's another one. This goes out to Kate Matthews. Congratulations, Kate. Your fact for now and

234
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,880
 forever is that the first BBC radio presenter with a northern accent was given the job to make it

235
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,240
 more difficult for the Nazis to impersonate news readers. Really? I remember exactly where we were

236
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,960
 when you said that fact. We were doing a Soho gig. I think it was one of our first Soho gigs.

237
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,360
 Oh, I think it was, was it not Aces? Is it Aces? You're right. It was Aces and Aces. That's right.

238
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,280
 It was a live show regardless. I think it was that first live show. Our first live show, really.

239
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,640
 It must be episode 30. Wow. Yes. It was called Wilfred Pickles, wasn't it? That's right. And the British

240
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,560
 authorities knew that crossover between Nazis and Northerners is zero. The Venn diagrams are completely

241
00:23:53,560 --> 00:24:03,080
 separate. Well, let's see how that Doughton by election goes next week. But I'm trusting. Yeah.

242
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,840
 That's why I know Nazis have ever been able to replicate this podcast. That's right. They managed

243
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:18,520
 to get you three to a T. But okay, here is one that is now under the custodianship of Kerry Harvey.

244
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:25,640
 And Kerry, your fact is in China, if you want to empty a building of people, you just have to play

245
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,480
 the song going home by Kenny G. Yeah. It is because it's just the song they play when it's home time.

246
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,720
 People know it. And so if you're in a shopping center or something, they start playing it. You hear

247
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,960
 it. You're like, oh, they must be time to close. Yeah. They play it if a train has reached its

248
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,880
 terminating point in the underground. So you know, to get off at schools, they play it at the end

249
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,120
 at the end of the day. I think they still do it because it was 10 years ago, obviously.

250
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,920
 What's going on? I hope Kenny G still has the cultural cash aid that he did then. I make Kenny G

251
00:24:52,920 --> 00:25:00,840
 as a kid in Hong Kong. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. That's big. He was hitting on someone. So I wasn't a welcome

252
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,720
 presence in the moment. How old for you? It was in a health club. I was about nine. You get an

253
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:14,360
 article for anything? I did. Yeah. Please, please, fuck off. I'm trying to hit on this lady. Go home.

254
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:26,440
 That is exactly the last of you. Scram kid. That's so funny. Dan. Dan, give us one more.

255
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,440
 Okay. This one goes out to Lindy Stevens, the two leading paleontologists of the 19th century

256
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:38,040
 used to destroy their fossil sites after excavating them so that their rivals couldn't excavate them.

257
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:44,680
 This was the bone wars. Basically, they hated each other so much that they just wanted to stop any

258
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,720
 other finds being being discovered or old, or dirt they'd been over. And there was a big scoundrel

259
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,360
 when one of them got a stegosaurus the wrong way round, wasn't it? Well, put the plates on the inside.

260
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,400
 Incredible. I think it could live at all. I might be getting that wrong. Maybe it's a deplodicus that

261
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,880
 had it that got the wrong way. I think there was a famous incident at one point. I think it was

262
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,720
 associated with one of these guys. Yes. That's right. Right. Episode number 30. If you want to go back

263
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,760
 and listen to it, find out more. Andy, give us one last one. All right. This one goes out to Henry

264
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:26,120
 Smith. And it's the fact that in the fuller language, a computer crash is a hookie, which means a cow

265
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:32,840
 falling over, but not dying. Wow. Okay. And this was about. This was about Mozilla Firefox and translating

266
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,880
 into lots of languages. So there are small languages where you need to come up with new metaphors

267
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,960
 for what's just happened to your computer. Because they're going to translate it into all these

268
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,680
 languages. Yeah. So they need to say what has happened. Where is the fuller language? Do you know?

269
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:53,480
 I think it stretches across lots of different countries in West and Central Africa. So it's a bit

270
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:01,160
 of everywhere. And there are a couple of other ones which are a timeout, which is your fish has

271
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:07,160
 gone away. It's a timeout. Like when your request has timed out, you have to be active. Your fish has

272
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:13,080
 gone away. And an aspect ratio is a rebuked from elders when a fishing net is wrongly woven.

273
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:20,120
 I think we can all relate to. Okay. Well, Henry, hope you enjoy that fact and hope you enjoy them too.

274
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:26,920
 Lindy, Kerry, Kate, Monique, Ian, Hannah and Paul, you have gotten your facts. And if you two are

275
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:32,520
