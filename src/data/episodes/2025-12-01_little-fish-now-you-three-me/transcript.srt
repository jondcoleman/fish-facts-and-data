00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,880
 Hi and welcome to an episode, episode number 5 in fact of little fish, little fish is

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,280
 the show where you send in your best bites and we rip them to pieces all and hopefully

3
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,760
 most of this week we tell you how great they are and we've done a little bit more research

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,840
 on each one of them so we can tell you a little bit more if we found some. So let's have

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,300
 no further ado. And he give us a fact. Alright, Izzy Turner writes in with a fact about

6
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,600
 the St Anne's Church in Cork City. Cork City. Beautiful city. Yeah, it makes it sound like

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,000
 a factory town like, well called a Cork City, son. We make all the cork, but it's not

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,140
 that's not it. Can't grow cork in Ireland, wrong climate. So what's the, right, there's

9
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,040
 not about the estomology of the name Cork. And it is expect, but there will be a cork

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,580
 city somewhere. Yeah, Portugal. What? Tunisia is a huge cork growing. My understanding

11
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,620
 is Portugal is the world's largest exporter of cork. Interesting. And the reason I think

12
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:21,020
 that is because I've been to Cork City as in a city that makes corks and I bought a cork

13
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:27,460
 bow tie from that city. And if I ever have to wear a bow tie, I still wear the one that's

14
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,760
 made out of cork. I'm believe in James. I don't know why. What? Something about what he

15
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,780
 said. And you know what, with a cork bow tie, if you're ever on a, on a boat and accidentally

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,760
 fall overboard, that's the floats. Well, there you go. But it'll float so much that your

17
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,080
 neck will be out of the water. But unfortunately, your head will be somehow. Yeah, it's just,

18
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,360
 I'm googling cork productions that now. Yeah, and it's so sure that Tunisia has a higher

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,320
 cork production than Portugal. Okay, I googled it and I don't want to, I don't want to

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,220
 talk about this anymore. Is he's fact is about St Anne's Church in Cork City and all four

21
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,960
 clocks on the faces of the clock tower display a different time to each other. Amazing. And

22
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,760
 the clock is known as the four faced liar. So none of them's right. I think they're all

23
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,120
 roughly right. But they're all different to each other. Oh, so it's not like a London

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:26,240
 Paris. No, it's all like three, 15, three, 19, three, 24. It's like, yeah. Question. So I have

25
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,240
 two people I know. One of them's my wife and the other ones are Toshinsky, who regularly

26
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,920
 have their clocks set to the wrong time so that they're never late for things. Oh, I do

27
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,000
 that too. Yeah. You do that. Do you do that, Andy? My Cassio naturally runs fast due to

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,360
 my body heat. But what? I don't remember that as part of Einstein's. That's because

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,360
 you know, it's a quartz watch. It's got a wafer of quartz inside a wafer. Of course.

30
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,400
 If you run the electric current through it, it vibrates a certain number of times per

31
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,520
 second. And under warmer temperatures, it vibrates more. Does it? And that means that

32
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,360
 your clock, your watch runs slightly first. So on a hot day, your Cassio will gain. I can't

33
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,200
 tell if you're telling the truth. I think it's possible. How much time? Like I'll set

34
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,360
 mine to maybe 10 minutes faster. Yeah, you won't arrive. Suddenly going to be arriving

35
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,760
 10 minutes early for things on a warmer day. You're running like microseconds ahead, aren't

36
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,960
 you? Yeah, but that's how I plan my time. I'm very busy, Dan. I have to do it to the microseconds.

37
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,680
 So anyway, I looked up this clock, basically. The St. Anne's Church in Cork City. And there's

38
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,600
 a tourist website I found, which claims that this was the first four-faced clock until

39
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,600
 Big Ben was built. Rubbish. I just can't believe it. I can't believe that we didn't have

40
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,160
 the technology of clocks with four sides on. I know, think back. You'll think about cathedral

41
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,680
 clocks and things, aren't you? But they're often on the front of a building. Thinking like,

42
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,800
 what's that tower in Warsaw? That's about clocks on it. Oh, yes, it has. But maybe only

43
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,640
 two. I don't know. I just think that's very interesting. Anyway, I have one related fact.

44
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,160
 Can I crowbar in an extra audience first? Matt Ireland wrote in. Actually, we were talking

45
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,520
 recently about people with place name surnames. Oh, yeah. Matt Ireland, he writes in with,

46
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,840
 in Bechels in Suffolk, the church tower only has three clocks on its four sides. The reason

47
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,320
 was when it was built, the people of Suffolk didn't want the people of Norfolk to know the

48
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,960
 time of day. That's so good. Getting our time for free. Those cheap skates. That's very good.

49
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,320
 It's funny. I think that Cork City is where they make cocks in Mat Island as the entire

50
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,400
 island where they make welcome mats. Would you know what Cork Island? I've just quickly looked

51
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,560
 it up on the sly. What they are, big producers of for the world. Oh, the city of Cork. Yeah,

52
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:51,680
 the city. That's where the county Cork. Yeah, Ireland. No, I don't know. It is Viagra. Oh, yes,

53
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,280
 the Viagra factory is down there. Okay. Because I remember there's a story that locals

54
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,520
 in the town were standing downwind of the Viagra factory. Charlie in the chocolate factory.

55
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,840
 He walks past the factory. He smells the amazing smells of the chocolate every day and he walks

56
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,560
 slowly. I don't know. Would you do that and slowly start bending over and you wouldn't get

57
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,480
 a golden ticket and you know, chocolate. I'm not sure what you would get. Five golden Viagra

58
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:33,720
 pills. The lucky openers will receive a permanent erection. Willie Wonker more like. Oh, my God. Yeah,

59
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:41,960
 carry up Willie Wanker. Okay. Jamie Thompson says, dear fishmongers. It's giving us the name

60
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,160
 fishmongers there. Nice. I thought you might like this if you don't already know about it and

61
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,240
 he sent me a link to the Pentagon pizza theory. I'm sure we all have heard of this before. Yeah.

62
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,880
 This is the idea that if something is going down on a mass scale with the government in America

63
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,200
 and the Pentagon need to get involved, they're going to have to put in long hours and so they're

64
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,680
 going to have to order in food. And it's been noted that there are certain times when there are

65
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,920
 huge orders of pizza for the Pentagon for these late night sessions. So the idea is that if orders

66
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,360
 are of spiking at any kind of pizza place near the White House or Pentagon, it means something is

67
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,560
 about to happen. Something's going on. And can you leverage that? Like, can you sort of short stocks

68
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,560
 or whatever? There are websites that will look at the different pizza parlors and see how

69
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,880
 busy they are. Really? Yeah, the pizza meter. It happened quite recently. I can't remember what it

70
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,080
 was for. Maybe it's Israel. I thought there was this whole rumor that went around because suddenly

71
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,560
 Donald Trump disappeared for a weekend. Everyone's like, is he ill? When he died. When he died,

72
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,880
 yeah, exactly. And so they were more afraid. They were finishing putting the final touches

73
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,280
 to the Robo Trump. Yeah, yeah. But it kept on making sense when it spoke. Some people knew.

74
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,200
 Come on, we don't want to have to make an apology or one billion pound fine.

75
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:05,720
 If you were trying to persuade people, you weren't a super villain. Would you sue for one billion dollars?

76
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,200
 Yeah, very true. That's a great theory. Yeah, wonderful. It is a theory. It's not, it's what it has

77
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:21,160
 the word theory at the end. I love it. Okay. I got another one here from Matt Bromhead. Matt says,

78
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,640
 my fact this week is that Patsy Klein, the first female artist to be inducted into the country

79
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,840
 Music Hall of Fame, used to give out her home phone number to fans in case they wanted to call her,

80
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:38,360
 which she did. We kind of spoke about this recently with Amy Gladhill about Laurel and Hardy.

81
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,400
 Which is that Stan Laurel used to give out his phone number and people would call him and

82
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,960
 he would just answer at home at someone called from the final artist. Okay. Actually, but yeah,

83
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:54,120
 he did do that after Hardy died. Yeah. And so Patsy Klein is great. Patsy, do you know her stuff?

84
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,320
 I don't really see anybody good. And she, she died very young. She was 30 years old. It was a plane

85
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,400
 crash. So she didn't have much time to carve out a full career. But I've got a couple of albums in

86
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,320
 my, in my music app. A church, a courtroom, then goodbye is one of her songs. Sounds sad. Yeah.

87
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:18,360
 That's, yeah, that's, that happens less and less these days. But what, oh, phone number's been given out.

88
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:26,680
 Oh, people dying and playing crashes. Yeah. Yes, that. Okay. Okay. Here's one from Tom Hayes. Tom says,

89
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,920
 "Form a lip dam leader, Ming Campbell wants beat OJ Simpson in a 100 meter race." Amazing.

90
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,360
 And it's true. That's what I can say. Ming Campbell was an amazing runner in his time.

91
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,160
 And so for international listeners, the lip dams are a big deal. Political party in the UK.

92
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,680
 Yep. And for non-American listeners, OJ Simpson is a murderer.

93
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:56,360
 Well, that lawsuit fell his ding in a way. But was he a runner as well?

94
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:04,040
 OJ Simpson was a football player and American football player. And he was also extremely fast.

95
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,800
 Like a lot of them are. But Ming Campbell was a runner who kept in the Scottish men's team at the

96
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:16,600
 1966 Commonwealth Games in Jamaica. He was known according to Tom Hayes as the fastest white man

97
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:25,080
 on the planet. Wow. And I think he probably was for some of the time. He was at the 1964 Olympics,

98
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,400
 but lost in the second round. And the British relay team came last in that Olympics. But he gave

99
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:38,200
 up athletics in 1968 just before the next Olympics at Mexico City. And the year earlier, he'd finished

100
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,800
 seconds of Tommy Smith in an indoor race in Sacramento. So do you know who Tommy Smith is?

101
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,720
 Yeah, but for anyone who doesn't. So in the 1966, Dan wasn't paying attention otherwise,

102
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,520
 he would have jumped in. I don't know who Tommy Smith is. No idea. In the '68 Olympics, he was the guy

103
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,720
 who stood on the podium and did the black power salute. Oh, remember that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,960
 And Ming Campbell should have been in that race by all accounts, but he gave up his career

105
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:12,680
 the year earlier to become a politician and a lawyer. So in another reality, Campbell decides not

106
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:20,840
 to become a politician. Beats Tommy Smith in the final of the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. And then

107
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,400
 Tommy Smith's never able to do his historic salute. Wow. What a sliding doors moment.

108
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,040
 I would love to see the movie of this event. Is it still sliding doors, though?

109
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,040
 Is it still still sliding doors? So it's going as Paltrow and the

110
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,240
 politician from the Lib Dems. Is it going as Paltrow playing Ming Campbell? Yes. Great. Yeah.

111
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,160
 Good. Who else is in that movie? I can't even remember if it's going as Paltrow.

112
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,840
 It feels like it's going as Paltrow. Yeah. It's certainly John Hanna, I believe.

113
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,760
 Wow. So is John Hanna playing Tommy Smith? He's going to be a challenging casting.

114
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,040
 Work will need to be receded quite a bit for this film to get made, I would say.

115
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,280
 Well, great. That was really good. And I went into newspaper archives and looked at the stories

116
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:11,960
 for when Ming Campbell was around doing these races. And yeah, he was basically all the Scottish

117
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,680
 newspapers were saying that he's the next fastest man in the world and the Sassanax need to believe it.

118
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,680
 Because, like, will he get into the British team or not? Because maybe they'll

119
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,680
 English, you'll just put all the English runners in and stuff. How funny. It's really interesting

120
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,720
 when you look back. Yeah, because it would have been, it would have been a way to headline and

121
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,080
 that great sprinted as I was to go into politics. Well, he'll never go anywhere.

122
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,320
 Actually, he's going to be the leader of the Lib Dems. One day when he's extremely old.

123
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,880
 Yeah. Still running. Still running. Brilliant.

124
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:50,280
 Okay, here's one from Jake Clements, who writes, "My wife Katie has been taking a

125
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,160
 course in landscape gardening and came across a particular type of Bramble and hasn't stopped

126
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,400
 giggling at the Latin name. It's called a Cockburnianus."

127
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:09,320
 Now, I would pronounce that Coburnianus because it's named after the Coburn family, but Coburn

128
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:16,680
 is spelled Cockburn. And yeah, I tried to find out more about it. There was a blog that said,

129
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,840
 "I've been trying to find out who among the Coburn family was being honored by William

130
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,720
 Botting Hensley when he named this newly discovered species, but without success."

131
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,920
 But I think I've worked out who it probably was. I think it was probably Henry Coburn who served

132
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:39,800
 in China for 25 years as British Consul General because this is a, it's a Bramble that's found in China.

133
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,960
 Well, that's great. So I pretty certain it's that person, not 100% certain, but yeah.

134
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,280
 Has the name sort of limited the Bramble's popularity?

135
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,000
 You know what, Bramble's, I think, don't have as much popularity as you might imagine.

136
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,120
 Oh, you go to any garden centre and there'll be an extensive Bramble section.

137
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,440
 You're like a rose or a dailyer. I think another Bramble.

138
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,120
 I have Bramble's in my garden. Do you? Do you grow, are they blackberry?

139
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,200
 They have, I think it's blackberries. Yeah, some kind of berries on there.

140
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,640
 Do you know what, I don't know what a Bramble is. I've just realised my whole life I've

141
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,440
 been casually referring to Bramble's. Oh, well they are. What is a Bramble?

142
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,600
 Well, to me it was always just a spiky bush, but I guess there's some kind of other

143
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,760
 yeah, tentacles. Don't write it, don't write it. And apologies to my wife for last year's

144
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:37,160
 anniversary flowers. I see now that that was not romantic. What year is the Bramble anniversary?

145
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:46,360
 It's the last year, always. The Cuckberry Anus years. The Cuckberry Anus years is an amazing name for

146
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,000
 an American sitcom from the 1980s, isn't it? That's the final Adrian Moll book.

147
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:59,400
 My turn. This is from Drew Ferguson. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature,

148
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,840
 they have a conservation list. The least weasel is currently considered to be of least concern.

149
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,480
 What about the most weasel? So just hanging out in there. Andy mentioned this on a podcast recently.

150
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,560
 Did I? Yeah. I can't remember what it was, but it's definitely something I've edited recently.

151
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,320
 Have you edited it out? No. Oh, dang. Oh, sorry. Maybe it just came to me in the moment,

152
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,160
 and I forgot my dear mark to it. I think you might have said that someone sent it in.

153
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,360
 Oh, there you go. Who sent it in? Drew Ferguson. Well, thank you, Drew.

154
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,280
 Double mention for you. Well, actually, I don't think you mentioned his name the first time.

155
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,880
 Single mention for you, Drew, but your fact has been on twice. Really good. Here's one from Soam

156
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,280
 Mojjee Brackets. NB email is so old, the fact may have changed. I think that's some commentary from

157
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,640
 you, Andy. Yep. So this person said, after staying up late on Wednesday to watch,

158
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,240
 done or which Wednesday it was, could have been any Wednesday in the last five years.

159
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,080
 To watch United, and he's talking about Man United, Manchester United, lose a way to Grimsby Town,

160
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,200
 12/11 on penalties, going to work the next morning was probably the worst thing that's ever happened

161
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,800
 to me. Anywho, it turns out that after this result, Grimsby Town, currently in the fourth division

162
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,960
 of English football, are now unbeaten against Manchester United for nearly 100 years last losing in

163
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:23,880
 1946. Wow. In that time, they have only played three matches with Grimsby winning two and drawing one.

164
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:32,040
 So nice facts, if you like football. If you don't like football, imagine what the headlines might

165
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:39,320
 have been for Grimsby beating Man United. So Grimsby is a very famous area for making fish.

166
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:47,560
 Yes. Or fishing. What might they have gone for? I saw this in a tweet by Martin Samuel the journalist.

167
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,800
 So can you guess what the headlines were when Grimsby beat Man United in this amazing game?

168
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,600
 And they're a big fishing town. Yeah. It feels like a clue. It was a clue.

169
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,160
 Coddle mighty. Very close. Same pun. Slightly different phrase.

170
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,160
 Cod, cod. Where is your cod now? I'm going to give it you. Active cod.

171
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,880
 Active cod is very good. And the other one was something you might say about a football team when

172
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,760
 they've been beaten. They're in a bad place. Very good, but no. They think it's all over now.

173
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:26,440
 It is it is trout. They think it's all over. It is trout. Final answer. The answer is battered.

174
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:34,120
 Anyway, I did some googling about other football teams who've got good records against Man United.

175
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:41,320
 MK Don's have never lost against Manchester United in their entire history, which admittedly is very

176
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,440
 short because they're a franchise who kind of took over another football team, but they've had one

177
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:53,400
 win 4-0 and South N United have never lost against Man United. They've had one win of 1-0.

178
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,440
 If you beat them once, you just like, well, we'll never play Man United again.

179
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,440
 Yeah, that was like when I used to play chess and my brother got better than me. I beat him once.

180
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:08,200
 They said, right, that's it. That's so childish. That was a child. Four nils is a battering.

181
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,480
 Very good. Unfortunately, that was M. K. Don's who did that. Milton Keynes is not a very famous

182
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,480
 fishing cat. Milton Keynes, they really sent them round about the houses. Very good.

183
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:25,400
 Okay, I'll do one here. This is from Phil P. Phil P says, 1918 in the UK, there was a Chinese

184
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,400
 magician who became quite famous named Cheng Ling Su. He was quite old. Spoke no English on stage,

185
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,480
 though. He got shot trying to perform the bullet catch trick, shocking as it was. His dying words

186
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:44,280
 shocked the audience even more when he said, lower the curtain, something went wrong. And so he had

187
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,360
 been playing this character. It's a very famous character within the world of magic, William

188
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:56,360
 Ellsworth Robinson. That was his real name. That was his real name. He basically created a character

189
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:03,080
 that was an old Chinese magician who would do amazing tricks on stage. But if anyone has seen

190
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:10,520
 the movie The Prestige, it's used as an example of how a magician's act extends beyond. Yeah, I

191
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:16,760
 know Andy does. Sorry, the listener doesn't see this, but Andy just rolled his eyes in such a way.

192
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,880
 It's a ridiculous film. He's got a big old Nolan issue. I once asked my wife to read me out the plot

193
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,360
 of The Prestige during a long car journey so that I could be annoyed about it. We were stuck in

194
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,360
 traffic and I was driving. No, I didn't know. I had a traffic. I needed an edge.

195
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:39,560
 You know what I, and I runically love, is the, now you see me movies? I've watched it like 10 times

196
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:47,240
 in the last month. Okay, that's, that's the trick that they pull on you. I actually really,

197
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,520
 really love that. I think it's magicians who do a con. Yeah, usually. The four magicians who

198
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,000
 are brought together and they don't know why, but there's a big magic idea for them to pull off

199
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,640
 this ultimate thing. But they don't know who they're working for. And they slowly have to complete

200
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,920
 this. And then I think, because I've seen, are there two of them? There's two of them. There's two.

201
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:10,680
 Well, third one comes out, came out a couple of weeks ago, but actually when we're recording this

202
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,440
 comes out on Friday. Is the, is the third one called Now You Three Me? No, it's called Now You Don't,

203
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,600
 so that's a terrible. I think my main problem with those films is the names because now you see me,

204
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,880
 which is a good title or a magic film. Yeah, it should have just been called Now You Don't,

205
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,360
 the second one. Absolutely. But instead it was called Now You See Me Too. Yeah. That's a bad title.

206
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,720
 Yeah. And then the third one is called Now You Don't, when that should have been the second. It

207
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,560
 makes no sense. It should have been. Now you see me, then Now You Don't, then Now You Three Me.

208
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:44,120
 We'll think of something for the fourth film. Yeah. Unless this is a cleverly planned misdirection.

209
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,200
 The second title, the third title, is all going to make sense in the fourth. That'll be it.

210
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,760
 I can't believe you've watched them so much over the last four. That's, that's mad. They were just

211
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,360
 good to have in the background while I needed to do other stuff, you know. It's a good

212
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:04,120
 mask tonight. Well, he else and he's just got something about him. Okay. Well, on that note,

213
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:11,160
 I think we've come to the end of your facts. So we're going to go to some of our old facts and

214
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:17,960
 we're going to dish them out to people who are members of the brand of the podcast here on Patreon.

215
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:26,120
 So drumroll, please, everyone. Well, that was okay, Andy, but I might add it in post. Let's hear

216
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:33,400
 the first person who is a friend of the podcast. Yeah. Okay. Here is a fact and Luke Ladroire.

217
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:40,440
 Luke Ladroire, it's a brilliant name. I'm sorry if I'm saying it wrong, but anyway, Luke is your fact

218
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,880
 and it's that a computer game has been invented that takes more than a lifetime to complete.

219
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,120
 This was a James Harkin. Yeah, and the idea was that you could play the game and then you could

220
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:59,160
 pass your high score onto your descendants. You could then continue the game. And it was the idea,

221
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,960
 I mean, quite a long time ago, we did this fact. It was the idea of like digital currency and

222
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,920
 how that will go when you die because we know what happens to your money when you die, but what

223
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:17,400
 happens to your digital self? We could have invented crypto bro. We could have done because this

224
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:24,680
 would be 2014. Was that where was crypto? It's probably been invented, but imagine if during that

225
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,320
 show, we'd researched it and found out there's a thing called Bitcoin and told all of our listeners

226
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,680
 about it and everyone bought one Bitcoin. Yeah. All of our listeners, we could be selling

227
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:42,360
 friend of the podcast for 50 grand. Did we ever mention this guy who someone who bought

228
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:51,080
 in something like 2010? I think Bitcoin had been invented a while ago. He bought a couple of pizzas

229
00:21:51,080 --> 00:22:00,440
 for something like 10,000 Bitcoin. He would have been a billionaire several times over today if he

230
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:07,640
 just not done that. And now Papa Jones is who they are. Anyway, Luke, that's your fact now to

231
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,800
 safeguard the shepherd and keep forever. In fact, why not play the game? Yeah, you'll have to go

232
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,000
 back to episode number seven to find out what it was. Dan, can you give us another one? Yep,

233
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,320
 this one is for Jakob and the fact is that 2013 was the first year since 1933 that there hasn't been

234
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,320
 a sighting of the Loch Ness monster. Oh, do you know what's happened since that? There's been

235
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:39,560
 plenty of sightings. Well, interestingly, it was the very nature of releasing a headline like that,

236
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:45,240
 which this was in the papers at the time that spurred people on to claim and send in photos and say

237
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,680
 that this is not the fact that basically they had lots of sightings while cameras were really

238
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:56,440
 shit for about 50 years. And suddenly everyone had a phone and cameras got really good and then

239
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,920
 they stopped being sightings and then Photoshop was invented and suddenly there were lots of sightings

240
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:06,280
 again. It's been tough. There is a theory when you can't pass off a leaf floating on the water.

241
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:12,920
 There is a theory that what if it's not that those photos were always blurry, but what if say the

242
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:19,480
 Loch Ness monster and Bigfoot themselves are blurry? So that's one of the counter-arguments to

243
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:25,640
 that. And it's a devastating counter-argument. What if they're all former members of the IRA and

244
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,400
 they have to be blurred every time they're on screen? And their voices have to be done by

245
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:37,480
 out-of-work actors. That's an excellent theory. Okay, well, Jakob, congratulations. No guessing whose

246
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,760
 fact that was when it was originally said. That was mine. Okay, I've got one from Anna here which is

247
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:49,560
 now under the custodian ship of Mark Osborne. Mark, your fact is that the French government forced

248
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:56,440
 Madame Tussaud to make models of her friends decapitated heads. Oh, a bit of a macabre one.

249
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:05,320
 That is a macabre, more like. Very good. I want you guys to know that I would do that for you.

250
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,960
 You would make models of her decapitated heads for the people whose heads have been decapitated.

251
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,040
 It was for their enemies. I just want you to know that I would make models of your decapitated heads.

252
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,800
 Would you? If I was forced to by the government. Right. I just want you guys to know that I would

253
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,320
 do that for you. I'm sorry, I've thought you'd react better to it. I'm wondering in what genre of

254
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,440
 model, like her puppet head, like a wax work. We've already got puppets of the four of us.

255
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,920
 It's a job done, mate. It's a job done. Do you want that to be your model in perpetuity, though?

256
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:40,200
 Yeah. I mean, you can't. I'm finished. It looks more like Dan and Dan looks like Dan.

257
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:48,120
 Why don't we just get Don Music from Sesame Street? Look it up. No, but I would do that for you guys.

258
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,920
 Thank you. I do appreciate that, but I feel like you don't have the requisite training

259
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:59,240
 on modeling heads and possibly the heads that you make of me, Dan and Anna, might not be exactly

260
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,440
 true to life. Yeah. That's a fair point. Why are you doing it? What's in what situation you're

261
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,120
 mentioning? The government is forcing me. I don't know. I think, so was it, why was she being forced

262
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,880
 to make models of her friend's head? Was it that they wanted to commemorate the friends? No,

263
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,360
 no. No, no. They've been decapitated. There are enemies of the revolution. Oh, sort of like,

264
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,720
 look here are the enemies of the revolution. Yeah. And here's what they suffered. Yeah.

265
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,200
 Madame Tussaud was friends with those people, but instead she wasn't killed because she hadn't

266
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,960
 done anything really bad, but they forced her to make the head switch. It wasn't like Dupier,

267
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,640
 your next door neighbor. It was prominent people. Yeah, well, you guys are prominent people.

268
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,800
 You're prominent in the podcast world. Andy, before you dig yourself any deeper into this Madame

269
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:48,520
 Tussaud shaped hole, why do you tell us about the next custodian of a fact? Okay. Hello, Todd Norbury.

270
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:55,000
 You are getting a fact, which I would say is one of my faves of all time. During the Normandy

271
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,880
 landings, the Allied forces deployed dogs by parachute. Oh, remember the days when we used to have

272
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,400
 parachuting animals in every episode? It was a happy time in my life. I love this fact so much,

273
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,240
 is that in fact, it might have been the first feat to touch the ground in the Normandy landings

274
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,280
 with dog feet. Really? Wow. Because there were there were German shepherds and they were

275
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:21,960
 like to trick the Germans into thinking that they were on their side because they could speak German.

276
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:29,000
 They could say surrender in the German language. I was about to say in the local language,

277
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,480
 but of course the local language was French, which was the whole problem in many ways.

278
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,600
 You're not upset? Are we saying that the whole problem of the Second World War was that

279
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,120
 French people were living in France? No. I'm saying. Because that's sure what it sounded like.

280
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:50,440
 I'm saying the presence of the German army in France was one of the problems of the Second World War.

281
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,320
 Oh, that was a problem. That was a big problem. That was. We're not one of those podcasts.

282
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,040
 You can find them elsewhere on the podcast or they do it. They're a plenty now. Anyway,

283
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,360
 these were German shepherds and they were parachuted in to help with the Normandy landings and

284
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,520
 be the kind of first dogs on the ground, kind of what they did now. The manager had been barking

285
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,640
 orders. Brilliant. It's so nice when you get a second bite at the cherry 11 years later.

286
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:21,080
 Dad, give us another one. Okay. I go on here. This is an interesting one. This is an interesting

287
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,600
 fact to be a custodian of because it's been 11 years and sometimes facts that we've said

288
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,480
 have been looked into more and we discover that are not strictly as true as we thought they were

289
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:40,200
 when we first set them. So this is a fact that is going to ARJG and the fact is that the music track

290
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:47,400
 on the anti-piracy advert used on all DVDs was itself pirated. Lovely fact. Great fact. You know

291
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:53,560
 that it would be sort of you wouldn't steal a handbag. You wouldn't steal a car. It was this big ad

292
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:59,160
 and the story was at the time that this had been itself pirated. I believe I got it from an Australian

293
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,760
 scientist who's been on no such thing as a fish. Dr Carl. Dr Carl. Dr Carl got it from one of his

294
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:10,040
 books. I think it was that there are slightly disputed versions of events. Some people say the music

295
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,240
 was used without permission. That has been a bit disputed because there was a different

296
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,400
 there was a different anti-piracy ad which definitely did use stolen music. So that did happen.

297
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:27,240
 And also there were questions about whether they'd licensed the typeface. Yes. I mean it was kind of

298
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,440
 it was kind of a nightmare. Oh we know for sure as they caused an absolute massive

299
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:41,160
 upsurge in people stealing handbags. Okay here is another fact. This one is under the

300
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:49,960
 custodiaship of Luisa Viviano and Luisa your fact is oh it's one from Alex Bell. It's his first

301
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,480
 ever fact on the podcast and it is that one of the last things that NASA had to do before launching

302
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:03,240
 space shuttles was removed there inflatable owls. Nice. So that was Alex Bell's fact it is now under

303
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,040
 your custodian ship Luisa. Congratulations fantastic. And if they use these inflatable owls to

304
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:13,960
 scare away other smaller birds didn't they? Yeah I think it was like hawks as well. I think it was

305
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:21,000
 yeah it was flying animals and it worked. And I guess mice. Possibly. I mean I don't know how big.

306
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,680
 burglars who are afraid of owls. It's also when you get downstairs to the space shuttle in the morning

307
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,280
 and it's gone and you feel like such an idiot and you realise it's been burgl. And you spend a

308
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,920
 while looking like oh maybe I parked it in the next space along and it's just not I've had that

309
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:42,680
 situation. It's a kicker. Okay we're going to have two more I think so Andy when and you give us

310
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:48,440
 one now. I'll do one. This one goes out to Craig Taylor. Congratulations Craig because your fact

311
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,080
 is this zinger is that according to the government of the Czech Republic there are three symbols of

312
00:29:53,080 --> 00:30:02,760
 Easter Easter eggs the Easter lamb and whipping. Being whipped. Yeah and that was because whipping was

313
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,560
 like a tradition wasn't it? Yes that they did like young boys would go around whipping young girls

314
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:13,400
 or something. It was a different time. It was a different time. But yeah I mean that was one of

315
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,720
 those facts where I didn't know for sure because I'm not Czech and I didn't have anyone in the

316
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:23,000
 Czech Republic to check with. So to speak. But that's why you said according to the government because

317
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,040
 it was on the government website. Yeah that's right. So yeah I mean was the country still the Czech

318
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,760
 Republic then or had it become Czechia? I do believe that the government has recently said

319
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:38,760
 if you don't really want to call it Czechia we don't mind. That's a Bosch rebrand isn't it? That's

320
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:44,920
 embarrassing. Yes. I just I think that's really interesting that we've now been going so long

321
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:52,040
 that that's changed. Wasn't there another country was isn't it? One of those two inside South Africa

322
00:30:52,040 --> 00:31:01,000
 Swaziland. Yeah. Oh Eswatini. Eswatini. Yeah yeah. Which used to be Swaziland. There's no Eswatini.

323
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,840
 It's because of Esports isn't it? Yeah yeah yeah they're like getting in that brand. But Turkey has

324
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:13,240
 changed its name to Turkey but spelled differently. Has it? Yeah. I didn't know that. I don't know.

325
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,040
 Oh you've not been spelling it the old fashioned way of your how embarrassing. Oh no. Oh no.

326
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:23,720
 Is it sort of Turkey? Yeah. It's Turkey. Yeah. Oh no and I've been going out spelling it Turkey.

327
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,280
 Yeah. Oh no. Oh god we've been eating Turkey at Christmas. Oh you're still allowed to spell that

328
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:38,680
 the old way. Oh no. We've been eating Turkey at Christmas. Okay one last fact before we wrap up for

329
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:45,480
 today Daniel Schreiber. Yeah this comes from Anna Toshinsky and Matt G.S. this now belongs to you

330
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:52,600
 at Earl's Court tube station in 1911. A one-legged man was employed to ride the escalator. His name was

331
00:31:52,600 --> 00:32:00,680
 bumper Harris. That was also a classic at the time. Classic classic fact. Yeah. Bumper Harris. And he

332
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:06,520
 was hired. He was hired wasn't he to show that it was safe. Even if you were one-legged. Yeah it was

333
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,560
 not a scary thing to because there must have been someone who was the first ever person to go on an

334
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:16,840
 escalator. Yeah they wanted to they could know it wouldn't eat them. And there are descriptions of

335
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,840
 people. I think I said this at the time on the podcast at Stratford International Mall. I was constantly

336
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,680
 as I was going down the escalators. There would be people on there who clearly and they're like in

337
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:32,200
 their 70s were going on for the very first time and not knowing and and almost falling on you

338
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,800
 and stopping at the bottom not knowing to move. It was wild. I got to watch what the bumper Harris

339
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,840
 world was experiencing. So for hours on end used to sit there laughing at you. That was old people.

340
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:51,080
 Get a few tins of beer. Sitting in your camp chair. I reckon there'll still be a couple of

341
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,680
 billion people who've not had a chance to go on an escalator yet on Earth a life today I would say.

342
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:00,040
 Absolutely. I mean so many people lack electricity you know just one of the very few like diesel powered

343
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:07,000
 escalators I'm guessing. Yeah sorry there are no nuclear ones that I know of. Well if you

344
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:15,720
 make a distributor of nuclear powered escalators that do write into podcast@QI.com and indeed

345
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,560
 if you want to write in with anything do write into podcast@QI.com. If you want to speak to the rest

346
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,360
