1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 We're going to go to the next room to take a look at what we're going to do.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,960
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,640
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,640
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,440
 I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,040
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,760
 last seven days and in a particular order, here we go, starting with you, James.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,680
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1921, the news of the world offered a free tea tray

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,680
 to any mother on the birth of her 10th child.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,680
 Why was it doing that?

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,720
 Well, the reason was it had just been the war and also there was contraception, widespreadly

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,800
 available now, which there wasn't before, and the newspapers had a bit of a kind of moral

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,120
 crisis about the being not enough children in the UK and so they wanted to encourage children.

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,840
 The daily express, for instance, had a Britain's largest family competition at the same time.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,640
 But the idea of the news of the world was that a woman would genuinely be induced to think,

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,160
 "Actually, I won't stop at three.

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,440
 I'll go all the way up to 10 children because once I get to 10, I'll get a tea tray."

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,440
 It's interesting, isn't it?

19
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,440
 What stage?

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,760
 After how many children do you go?

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,280
 I might as well carry on for the tea tray now.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,280
 I have a theory that the unless tea trays have massively depreciated in value, the cost

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,280
 of rearing a child would not be offset by the value of the tea tray.

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,120
 I think that's pretty solid theory, actually.

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
 Do you think that's solid economics?

26
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,360
 Well, how often they made, I wonder how many tea trays they had to give away.

27
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,920
 Do you think they just no one actually went for it because in the end, it's only a tea

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,920
 tray and when the news of the world shut down, what they had to clear out of their offices

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
 were 50,000 tea trays.

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,000
 That's a good point though, when did that deal expire?

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,840
 If they're running the competition for a year, say it, only applies to people who realistically

32
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,160
 got nine children and can get pregnant within the next three months.

33
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,680
 Maybe it was running all the way until the news of the world closed last year or the year

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
 before.

35
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
 Maybe that's what sent them down.

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,160
 Some have finally claimed the tea tray.

37
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,520
 No, it was massive phone hacking.

38
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,520
 Yeah, let's be clear.

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,640
 We should, for overseas listeners, news of the world was a massive newspaper here.

40
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,520
 It came out every Sunday and they got caught for a big hacking scandal of people's mobile

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,280
 phones and so Rupert Muradalk had to shut it down.

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,800
 There was so much pressure.

43
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,240
 I was looking into things that had been given away for free.

44
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,960
 Here's one free thing that was given away that I'm very annoyed to learn because I've found

45
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,320
 out it's no longer going.

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:43,480
 But Etti had had a promotion whereby if it rained while you were in Abu Dhabi, you would

47
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,720
 get a free trip off the back of it.

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,360
 It had a guarantee sunshine or your next holiday free.

49
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,080
 You're going to Abu Dhabi soon, aren't you?

50
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,560
 Yeah, I'm going in about two weeks.

51
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,440
 Well, maybe if you say Etti had enough time, you said, "Well, you get a free trip, I do love

52
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
 Etti had."

53
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
 So, who was the company?

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
 Etti had.

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
 Right.

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
 What do they do?

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
 They're an airline.

58
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
 They're an airline.

59
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
 They're the best out there.

60
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
 Actually, they've been voted number one airline.

61
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
 Actually, I think they're awful.

62
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,960
 Good luck getting that free trip down.

63
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,920
 Have you guys had a newspaper insurance?

64
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
 No.

65
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,200
 If you subscribed and you got a medical condition, the newspaper would pay you some money and

66
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,000
 they would print massive columns full of people who had won money or been given money.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,920
 So, in 1922, if you've got appendicitis and you're subscribed to the Express, you get

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,640
 a tenor, which is quite a lot of money.

69
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
 Wow.

70
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
 Yeah.

71
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
 When?

72
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
 How long ago?

73
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
 This is the 20s.

74
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
 And a tenor of today's money or...

75
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
 No.

76
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
 Back then.

77
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
 No, no, no.

78
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
 How much today's money was?

79
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,840
 Same travel to the future, they were so rich in those days.

80
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
 Amazing.

81
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,200
 Actually, one of the earliest newspapers was called "Ikabod Dorks Newsletter."

82
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
 I think this...

83
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
 Your works?

84
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,200
 That's one of these things I wrote down, but completely fine.

85
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,120
 It's DAWK, so there's nothing funny about that at all, actually.

86
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,920
 You can't get many "Ikabods" these days.

87
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,160
 I think it's a very nice name.

88
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,560
 I think so as well.

89
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,120
 If you're about to have your tenor child, why not call it "Ikabod"?

90
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,120
 People send you a free no such thing as a fish mug.

91
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
 We'll genuinely do it.

92
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
 We can promise that, right?

93
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
 Yeah, we can promise that.

94
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
 Okay.

95
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,120
 We need evidence.

96
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,120
 We need a birth certificate.

97
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
 Yeah.

98
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
 The price of rearing the baby.

99
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,120
 Do you think that's going to be offset by the price of a no such thing as a fish mug?

100
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
 They are extremely valuable.

101
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
 There's always one of them in the world at the moment.

102
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
 There's one in the world, yeah.

103
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
 I should finish this off.

104
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,480
 So Mr. Dorks Newsletter was one of the first newspapers, and it came with a blank space

105
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,200
 in every edition so that you could buy it, and then the blank space was for you to write

106
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,200
 your own personal news, because then you'd send it to your friends and relatives.

107
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
 That's a really good idea.

108
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
 Yeah, it's such a good idea.

109
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
 Because people would share newspapers.

110
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,200
 It used to be that one newspaper, people estimate it would be read by about 20 to 30 people.

111
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
 Yeah.

112
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
 Yeah.

113
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
 Because often it was read out loud as well, isn't it?

114
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,200
 I missed those days, because I didn't actually live in the 19th century, but I would, if I had,

115
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,200
 miss those days when there would be a literate person, and then people who couldn't read

116
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,200
 as well, or people who just wanted to hear the newspaper read out.

117
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,200
 And they all crowd around and clamor to have the news read out in the 19th century, and then

118
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
 someone would read it out.

119
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
 Wouldn't that be great?

120
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,200
 I can't imagine sitting down in the 19th century with your grandfather on his chair, and he opens

121
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,200
 up the newspaper, says, "Gather round everyone, gather round."

122
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,200
 It's how he's star in three-in-a-bed rom.

123
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
 Yeah, true.

124
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,200
 This is the thing about the news of the world, is that it was a crime newspaper for the first

125
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
 few decades.

126
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
 Yeah.

127
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,200
 Are they specialised in gruesome murders, and also in Vickers court in impropriety and things

128
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
 like that?

129
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,200
 Yeah, the news of the world was always trashy and scandalous.

130
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,200
 It wasn't because I thought maybe you'd read back into its history, and you'd find out that

131
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,200
 it used to be a well-respected paper, but it was always, yeah, really gossipy and full of

132
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
 lured things and murders.

133
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,200
 And at the very start of the 20th century, the editor of the Palma Gazette, I think, a more

134
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:58,200
 paper who was called Frederick Greenwood, went up to the editor of the news of the world and said,

135
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,200
 "He'd looked at the paper once, and then he'd immediately put it in his waste paper basket."

136
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,200
 And then he thought, "If I leave it there, the cook may read it, so I burned it."

137
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,200
 There was a bloke who a couple years ago found a first edition of the news of the world,

138
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
 which was in 1843.

139
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,200
 He was called William March, age 72, and he found it in his attic.

140
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,200
 He said, "I was just clearing stuff out, and I just found it there.

141
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
 I was going to dump it, but then I saw the date.

142
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,200
 It cost just three pence, and it's just eight pages.

143
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,200
 I have looked through it, and it is a bit boring."

144
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:37,200
 They used to be newspapers or magazines, which were exclusively for Lonely Hearts Adverts,

145
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
 all the way through the 19th century.

146
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,200
 So the first one was called Matrimonial News, and then it was followed in rapid succession by

147
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,200
 the marriage gazette, matrimonial times, matrimonial record, matrimonial herald,

148
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,200
 aristocratic matrimonial, marriage envoy, marriage advertiser,

149
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,200
 matrimonial chronicle, matrimonial world, matrimonial courier,

150
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,200
 honeymoon, matrimonial intelligence here, and matrimonial register.

151
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,200
 Ironically, all bought by people who weren't married.

152
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
 Exactly!

153
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
 What a misnomer!

154
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,200
 Why aren't there some desperate singleton gazettes?

155
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,200
 Okay, time for fact number two, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

156
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:25,200
 My fact is that Belgian fishermen go fishing on horseback, and they drown in their thousands.

157
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
 Do they?

158
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
 No, they don't.

159
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,200
 They fish just on the coast, and they're fishing for shrimp.

160
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,200
 Okay, so they're not on like big boats on horseback.

161
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,200
 I'll be honest, I thought in the river rather than on the coast,

162
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
 I'm even surprised that it's on the coast.

163
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, and they have really, really strong horses,

164
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
 because the horses are up to the top of their legs and more so,

165
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
 and obviously that's quite hard to wade through that,

166
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
 especially if you're a horse, and you've got more legs.

167
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,200
 And then once you're dealing with the vast weight of shrimps on top of that?

168
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

169
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,200
 And so they pull a net behind them, and they also pull a chain in front of the net,

170
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
 and the chain stirs up the shrimps, and it frightens them a bit,

171
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
 and it means they flee into the net.

172
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
 Oh, yeah.

173
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
 And then you have, yeah.

174
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
 And not many people do this anymore, unfortunately,

175
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,200
 i.e. 12 households do it still,

176
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
 because it's not very profitable anymore.

177
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,200
 And are they using rods or spears?

178
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
 No, they're using neither.

179
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
 Why would it be rods or spears?

180
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,200
 Oh, I thought they would be looking at the fish, swimming past them,

181
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
 and they would...

182
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
 Or they would sit there with a rod, just fishing.

183
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
 Have you ever tried to spear a shrimp?

184
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,200
 You've got a really good aim.

185
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
 That's true, yeah.

186
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
 You know, all skewed kebabs.

187
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
 That's how they make them, yeah.

188
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
 It's really annoying, because you have to wait for them to line up

189
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,200
 in just the right order, and then to spear them.

190
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
 So some of the ways of catching fish?

191
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
 Yeah.

192
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
 And there's some good ones in America.

193
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
 They had a thing called telephoning.

194
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
 What you would do is you would take a telephone off the wall.

195
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
 They had like a magnetic coil in there,

196
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,200
 and you would kind of ramp that up, and so it got electric.

197
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
 And then you would put the wires in the water,

198
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,200
 stun all of the fish, and then just grab them.

199
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
 And then what people would do was then get the phone,

200
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
 put it back on the wall, and ring their friends up to say,

201
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
 "Guess what I've done today."

202
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
 No.

203
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,200
 Another one is called catfisting.

204
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
 What?

205
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
 No.

206
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,200
 Yeah, catfisting, and that is exactly what it sounds like.

207
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
 I don't think you can be exactly what it is.

208
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,200
 You put your fist into the water, and the catfish kind of grabs onto it,

209
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,200
 and then you pull your fist out, and the catfish is on your hand,

210
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
 so you're using your fist as bait.

211
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,200
 I had the opposite in my head, in that you fist a cat.

212
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,200
 You put that under the water, and the cat catches a fish.

213
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,200
 So I was really close.

214
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
 You were so close, Dad, yeah.

215
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
 But cats love fish.

216
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
 Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

217
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,200
 So they're kind of jointly hating it, and loving it at the same time.

218
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
 It's a roller coaster of emotions.

219
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
 That's also noodling, isn't it?

220
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
 And I think that's really dangerous, because it often involves diving

221
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,200
 to quite low depths, because the catfish live in holes,

222
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,200
 and you dive to low depths, and I think people drown or they get.

223
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
 I think it's got a high injury rate.

224
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,200
 Well, it's a good thing that cats have nine lives, in that case.

225
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,200
 You can catch eight catfish.

226
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,200
 I have a couple of things on Belgium, and I really like this.

227
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,200
 Now, I think, like how you're saying, there's only about 12 families left

228
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
 that do this kind of thing.

229
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,200
 I don't know if this is a national sport, but it's certainly been documented.

230
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
 It's called "Shit Yourself Rich."

231
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
 And it's a really cool idea.

232
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,200
 The sport involves, you divide a field up into an imaginary grid,

233
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,200
 and everyone starts having a bet where the cow in that field will have a poo,

234
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
 and whoever gets it right then gets the money.

235
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,200
 So it's basically a lot of Belgians watching a cow in a field waiting for it to poo,

236
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,200
 with money riding on the spot that it's going to go in.

237
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
 I have a feeling that might have happened in Britain as well.

238
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
 I've heard about it a few times, yeah.

239
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
 And it's just basically a lottery kind of thing, isn't it?

240
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
 Yeah.

241
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,200
 Also, I've read that Belgium is the largest exporter of billiard balls.

242
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
 It's quite cool.

243
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
 80% of the world's billiard balls are made in Belgium.

244
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
 Really?

245
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
 Wow!

246
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
 Really odd.

247
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,200
 It reminds me of that fact that most of the world's false teeth come from Lichtenstein.

248
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
 Really?

249
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,200
 I was reading an adventure book for boys that was written in 1890,

250
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,200
 and it recommends goose fishing.

251
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,200
 Oh, I think you mean goose fishing, isn't it?

252
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,200
 Yeah, so you use goose fishermen, they're called,

253
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,200
 and it recommends that you just tie a fishing line and hook to a goose's leg,

254
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
 and then you drive the goose into the water, and that works as a fisherman.

255
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,200
 And it just swims along, and it's got bait on the end.

256
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
 And as soon as the goose feels a fish pulling on his leg,

257
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,200
 it gets a bit distressed because the fish is trying to pull it underwater,

258
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
 and it swims back to the shore, and it brings the fish with it,

259
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
 and then you unhook it, and there you go.

260
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
 You haven't had to do anything.

261
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
 Wow.

262
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
 That's pretty ingenious.

263
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,200
 Do you know, it's really hard for us to tell how fast fish swim.

264
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
 What?

265
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
 Well, it's really, how do you know what the fastest fish is?

266
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,200
 How can you measure speed of fish?

267
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
 I guess it's hard to see them under the water,

268
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
 and then you'd have to be going at the same speed as them,

269
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
 otherwise they're just, you know, two miles away,

270
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,200
 and you're still sitting your boat, you don't know where they are.

271
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
 Yeah.

272
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,200
 So what they do do is this is a thing that's been set up

273
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
 amongst professional fishermen is that when they've caught something,

274
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
 they start measuring how fast the reel goes out,

275
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
 so the speed of the reel, and then they log that time.

276
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,200
 So they found, so far, in any of these experiments,

277
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
 that the fastest fish is the sailfish,

278
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,200
 and it took out a 300 feet of line, a fishing line, in three seconds.

279
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,200
 So it went from zero to 60 in 2.6 seconds.

280
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
 That is incredible.

281
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,200
 Although I guess these fish, they've just been caught, haven't they?

282
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,200
 And they're trying to escape, so it's not like a normal fish would go that fast, maybe.

283
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
 Yeah, so maybe we could improve human 100 meter times by...

284
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,200
 The guy shooting the gun to start, start pointing it out.

285
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
 That's the way to do it.

286
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
 But yeah, that's interesting.

287
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
 I had no idea.

288
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
 I assumed that we just knew what the fastest fish was.

289
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
 Yeah, I would assume we'd tag them.

290
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,200
 Well, they are swimming faster fish in response to human fishing.

291
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
 So... Yeah, sensible.

292
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,200
 Well, the fish... If you are chasing a fish with a net,

293
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,200
 which sometimes happens, you've got a, you know,

294
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
 trying to out swim a net, basically.

295
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,200
 The slower fish will be caught, and then the faster fish will survive,

296
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
 and then they're more likely to breed.

297
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,200
 So we might actually change fish physiology just by fishing for them.

298
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,200
 Might they get stronger because the stronger ones manage to wriggle out of the nets,

299
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,200
 and the weaker ones get caught, and then eventually you've got massively fast,

300
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
 super strong fish.

301
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
 Eventually the fish will be catching us.

302
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
 No, they'll be fishing for humans.

303
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,200
 We'll just see these rods coming out of the water, onto the land, dragging us in.

304
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,200
 The dystopia I see before me.

305
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
 You see a cat?

306
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,200
 Just the adorable cat, and you go over to pet it,

307
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,200
 and then you see it's got a fin poking out at the end of it.

308
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:49,200
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

309
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,200
 My fact this week is that 68% of mountains don't have pointy peaks.

310
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
 So what does that mean?

311
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,200
 Does it mean like, like, table mountain, it has a flat top?

312
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,200
 Yeah, yeah, so I guess any time you draw a mountain,

313
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,200
 if we were drawing a mountain, we would give it a pointy peak, right?

314
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
 And so this is why this fact really surprised me.

315
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
 I just assumed that it's going to have a pointy peak.

316
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,200
 Some guys at Princeton University, Paul Elson and Morgan Tingley,

317
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,200
 decided that they wanted to do a survey and see how many mountains do, in fact, have pointy peaks.

318
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,200
 So they did a, they took satellite data from 182 mountain ranges around the world,

319
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,200
 and they looked at it, and they discovered that 68% of these mountains didn't have a pointy peak.

320
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
 So that's a sort of...

321
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,200
 So I think the definition of pointy peak is important here,

322
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
 because I wasn't that surprised at first, because I thought, well, no mountain peaks.

323
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,200
 Because every time you climb a mountain, you're not kind of balancing the little kind of pointy.

324
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,200
 I always pierce my foot and top step.

325
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,200
 So it's actually more interesting, even than it sounds, I think,

326
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:56,200
 because the guys who did the study define pointy peak or define a pyramid-shaped mountain,

327
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,200
 as just a mountain whose area steadily decreases as it goes up, right?

328
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,200
 So as a mountain whose sides just steadily move towards each other,

329
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,200
 so it doesn't mean that the peak has to be as sharp as a needle.

330
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
 So it could be a ziggurat's wrap and the pyramid?

331
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,200
 Exactly, it could be a ziggurat.

332
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
 It's like a pyramid with a flat top.

333
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
 Yeah, okay.

334
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
 Yeah, so you could have a flat top, exactly.

335
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:24,200
 And what they found is, I think, that actually mountains often have an hourglass shape,

336
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,200
 so their area would start off big, and then it would get smaller as it went up,

337
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,200
 but then it would increase again, and then sometimes they'd be inverted pyramids,

338
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
 where I think...

339
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
 Is that incredible?

340
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
 This is amazing.

341
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
 That is rubbish.

342
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,200
 Well, that's much less cool than it sounds though, right?

343
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
 Because it's not like an upside-down pyramid.

344
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
 It's not like it's an excited point on the ground.

345
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
 Yeah, and where it gets way outward.

346
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:52,200
 It's where it gets less and less steep, so it doesn't consistently go up like pyramids.

347
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
 Oh, that's interesting.

348
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
 Yeah.

349
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
 Okay.

350
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
 But yeah, and there are...

351
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,200
 So they found those inverse ones that you're talking about,

352
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,200
 which is 6% in the survey, were these type.

353
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
 So that's where the land area increases to the top.

354
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:12,200
 23% had this hourglass shape, and then 39% had a diamond form, which is really cool.

355
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,200
 So that's less land area at the top and the bottom, so more in the middle.

356
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
 But where are these mountains that are shaped like diamonds?

357
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,200
 They start at a point on the ground, then they spread out to this massive thing in the middle,

358
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
 then they shape...

359
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,200
 They don't have much publicity because no one can climb them.

360
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,200
 So one of the things about this study, or one of the things that makes it relevant

361
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,200
 and not incredibly dubious, they're all mounted to diamond plates.

362
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,200
 But the interesting thing is that as climate change happens,

363
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,200
 as the planet gets warmer, animals which live in a particular band on a mountain

364
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,200
 are going to be pushed upwards because they're going to be pushed

365
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
 and where there's the same temperature.

366
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,200
 So some species will benefit where they actually have more surface area higher up,

367
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,200
 but some of them will, a lot more of them, I think, will suffer as a result

368
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,200
 because you get much smaller habitat for the species to live on.

369
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,200
 They have to hope that they evolve wings and are able to take off from the top,

370
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,200
 won't they? Is that pushed higher and higher up?

371
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
 They'll be a period where they're just waiting for that to happen.

372
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
 I imagine.

373
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
 That's exactly how you fully should work.

374
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
 Yes.

375
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,200
 Where are they going to go when they've grown these wings?

376
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
 They'll just live up in the air.

377
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
 I see.

378
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
 I've got birds to live in a cloud.

379
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,200
 If you'd like to subscribe to Anna's Extreme Optimism magazine,

380
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,200
 have you guys been to the top of mountains?

381
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
 Some of them.

382
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,200
 I just want to do a quick survey of how many of you have done.

383
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,200
 I just want to do a tiny survey.

384
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
 I've only been up one mountain.

385
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
 I've been up to Ben Nevis.

386
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
 Okay, so Ben Nevis is the top light.

387
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
 It's a scree-like.

388
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
 What was that mean?

389
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
 The same as Garpa Mike.

390
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
 Loose rocks.

391
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
 Loose rocks.

392
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
 And then there's kind of a table thing that you stand on,

393
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,200
 so people can take your photo so that it's like, yeah, I got to the top.

394
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
 And you're at the top of the top.

395
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
 Yeah.

396
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
 The only mountain I've been on, which is Mount Cosiosco in Australia.

397
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
 Do you mean Cosicosco?

398
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
 That's an interesting misconception of how that is said.

399
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
 It's actually Mount Cosiosco.

400
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,200
 Please write in to tell me how correct I got that.

401
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
 They have that as well.

402
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,200
 They have a little platform that you stand on top of.

403
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
 Have they artificially added to the height of the mountain?

404
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
 Yes.

405
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
 In a way, yes.

406
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
 Definitely.

407
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
 Just on mountains.

408
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
 Yeah.

409
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,200
 I assume that we had climbed pretty much every mountain, partly because of the song.

410
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
 Yeah.

411
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
 She was telling people to climb every mountain.

412
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,200
 Well, the message has not got across because the chairman of the Mount Everest Foundation Committee,

413
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,200
 Lindsey Griffin, said a few years ago, there are far more unclimbed peaks than climbed ones.

414
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
 So many more.

415
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
 Highest pint in Bhutan, you're not allowed to climb up.

416
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
 Really?

417
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,200
 Also, there was a thing about Kantchenchunga, which was when people go up there,

418
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,200
 you're supposed to, there's like a local tradition when you're not supposed to stand on the absolute summit.

419
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,200
 So you're supposed to stop like two steps before or something.

420
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
 And the first people who did it definitely did that.

421
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,200
 And I wonder if everyone who's gone up has kind of stopped just before,

422
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
 and whether it's never been climbed.

423
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
 It probably has, really.

424
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:11,200
 The far highest mountains on Earth, Everest, K2, Kantchenchunga and Lotsi were first scaled in 1953,

425
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,200
 1954, 1955, and 1956, respectively.

426
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
 Wow.

427
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
 Why did we keep that up?

428
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
 Yeah.

429
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
 Damn it.

430
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,200
 We could have counted down all the way to the lowest mountain in the world.

431
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
 That would have been amazing.

432
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,200
 And this suspense would gradually decline and decline and decline.

433
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
 Eventually you're just climbing a little hill.

434
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
 Yeah.

435
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
 2,550.

436
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
 Yeah.

437
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,200
 This is the thing that would take so long because there are so many thousands of peaks.

438
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,200
 Yeah.

439
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
 I'm surprised that Chimborazu is not seen to be.

440
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
 Okay.

441
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,200
 So Mount Chimborazu, there's an Ecuador, is the highest point on Earth.

442
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,200
 It's 2.4 kilometers higher than Mount Everest because of the shape of the Earth.

443
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
 Further from the center of the Earth.

444
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
 Exactly.

445
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
 Because Earth bulges a bit around the equator.

446
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
 Exactly.

447
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:04,200
 So it is by a long mile, well, 2.4 miles, that would be a long mile.

448
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,200
 That is the highest spot on Earth.

449
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,200
 And I'm surprised that that's not seen as more of a, because there must be with altitude and with the thinness of air.

450
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
 That must be more of a challenge to get to the top.

451
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,200
 In the 19th century they did think it was the highest for ages they did.

452
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,200
 And it was when like Nepal was kind of Westerners couldn't really go there.

453
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,200
 And so everyone thought that Chimborazu was the highest.

454
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
 For quite a long time.

455
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
 Wow.

456
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
 That's really interesting.

457
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
 Yeah.

458
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
 So it had its day in the sun down.

459
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
 Yeah.

460
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
 Don't feel bad for it.

461
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,200
 I've discovered a really interesting lady as a result of looking into this stuff about mountains.

462
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
 Her name is Elizabeth Hawley.

463
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
 She's in her 90s.

464
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,200
 She has lived for over 50 years in the Himalayas.

465
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,200
 And she has become the ultimate person for verifying summits that have been made by explorers.

466
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
 She put together the Himalayan database.

467
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,200
 And she's someone who's cracked down on whether or not people are lying about getting to the top.

468
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,200
 Because she has an in with all the Sherpas who tell her the truth about what's going on.

469
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,200
 Yeah. So she's sussed out a lot of fraud.

470
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,200
 And she verified the first ever blind ascent to Everest.

471
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
 And she's been living there 60 years.

472
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:14,200
 And she every explorer, if they want to take it seriously, apparently track her down and tell her about their plans

473
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,200
 so that it can be verified in this database that she's been keeping for 60 years.

474
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,200
 I wonder if she has a guy called Morris Wilson on her list.

475
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,200
 He was a guy in the 1930s who thought that mysticism and prayer would help him to climb Everest.

476
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
 That didn't work.

477
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,200
 And so what he decided to do was to fly a plane and crash it just below the top of Everest

478
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
 and then walk up the last few feet.

479
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
 How far did he get with that?

480
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,200
 Well, the first time he got as far as Bradford.

481
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
 [laughter]

482
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
 Well, he crashed into a field.

483
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
 And so then the air ministry banned him from flying.

484
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
 But he just did it anyway.

485
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
 And he managed to get as far as Tarjeeling.

486
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,200
 And actually, he did fly his plane to Everest and he did crash it.

487
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,200
 It seems like he died before, well, he definitely died.

488
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
 When was this?

489
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
 1930s.

490
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,200
 Did he ever get out plan for getting out of the plane before it crashed into the mountain?

491
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
 I think so.

492
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,200
 I think he would kind of just jump out with a parachute or something.

493
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,200
 But then kind of thought, well, I'll just walk up to the top then, that'll be fine.

494
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,200
 And then the way down, I mean, how hard can it be to go down?

495
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,200
 Where is the largest mountain so far as we know in the universe or the solar system, let's say?

496
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
 Mars.

497
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
 It was.

498
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
 It's been taken over now.

499
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
 Olympic mons in Mars.

500
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
 Olympic.

501
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
 Yeah, exactly.

502
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
 It's been taken over.

503
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,200
 So it's now a rear-sylvia on an asteroid called four-vester.

504
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
 And it's about half the size of the moon.

505
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,200
 So it's traveling, hurtling through the universe, the tallest mountain.

506
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
 Wow.

507
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
 Yeah.

508
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
 It's now awesome.

509
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
 That's very cool.

510
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
 I hope it doesn't impale us on its sharp point.

511
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
 Do we know what kind of shape it is?

512
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,200
 I mean, the odds are actually 68% that it doesn't have a sharp point.

513
00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:00,200
 It's probably a diamond or an oblate's ferroid or a rhombus mountain.

514
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
 OK, it is time for a final fact of the show.

515
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
 And that is Anna.

516
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:12,200
 My fact is that the oldest your mum joke appears on a 3500-year-old Babylonian tablet.

517
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
 And it's an absolute cracker.

518
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,200
 Is it your mum's so old she appears on a 3500-year-old Babylonian tablet?

519
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,200
 So what is the joke itself?

520
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,200
 Well, there's a minor problem in that we don't have the first half of it.

521
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,200
 Does it not begin with your mum?

522
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
 It doesn't.

523
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
 Your mum features actually a little bit later.

524
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
 As a punchline.

525
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,200
 Yeah, so we have a missing part.

526
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,200
 And then we have the words of your mother is by the one who has sex with her.

527
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
 Who is it?

528
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
 Wow.

529
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,200
 It sounds like a mixture between the first ever your mum a joke and the first ever knock-knock joke.

530
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,200
 And then you have your mother is by the one that has sex with her.

531
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
 Who?

532
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,200
 So are they known to be full of jokes, Kuneiform tablets?

533
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,200
 Hilarious, yeah, everything in Kuneiform was a joke.

534
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,200
 No, but there is this tablet that was found in the 70s, I think,

535
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,200
 but has only recently been analysed, which is full of these riddles and these jokes,

536
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
 which are quite difficult.

537
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,200
 If anyone can understand the humour in them, then write in.

538
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,200
 The other one reads, the defloured girl did not become pregnant, the undefloured girl became pregnant.

539
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
 What is it?

540
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,200
 And the answer is auxiliary forces.

541
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
 See, that kills.

542
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,200
 I should open with that one.

543
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
 I'm obviously missing something here.

544
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
 That's too high-brow for me, clearly.

545
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,200
 Do you know there's your mum joking the Bible?

546
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
 It's a book of kings.

547
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
 And I'll read it out.

548
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,200
 When Joram saw Jehu, he said,

549
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
 "Is it peace, Jehu?"

550
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
 And he answered,

551
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,200
 "What peace, so long as the harlot trees of your mother, Jezebel and her witchcraft are so many."

552
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
 Whoa!

553
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
 That is a good one.

554
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
 Yeah.

555
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
 And then from this side of the table.

556
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,200
 We're more into our Babylonian your mum's jokes.

557
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,200
 It's not really your mum's joke, it's your mum insult, I suppose.

558
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
 Yeah, yeah.

559
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
 It's a fine line, isn't it?

560
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,200
 There's an ancient Egyptian joke, so I'm going to test this material on you guys now.

561
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,200
 Yeah, yeah.

562
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
 How do you entertain a bored Pharaoh?

563
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
 I don't know.

564
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,200
 How do you entertain a bored Pharaoh?

565
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
 Is it with a pyramid of um, for a russia?

566
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,200
 Yes, but it's a pyramid that's shaped like a parallelogram.

567
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,200
 Like most mountains in the world, as we know.

568
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,200
 No, it's, you sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the Nile

569
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,200
 and urge the Pharaoh to go catch a fish.

570
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,200
 Oh, that's the way I tell him.

571
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
 How do we know about that joke?

572
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,200
 Was that just an extremely long, horrific thing that we've worked it out from?

573
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,200
 No, it's writing, wasn't in hieroglyphics, it was in what?

574
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
 I had this question.

575
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
 I had this question.

576
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
 Oh, yeah, of course, sorry.

577
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
 Yeah.

578
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
 Sorry, ancient Egyptians.

579
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
 Okay, one more ancient Egyptian joke.

580
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
 One more ancient Egyptian joke.

581
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,200
 Man is even more eager to copulate than a donkey.

582
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
 His purse is what restrains him.

583
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
 Oh, it's a prostitution joke.

584
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
 Yeah, no.

585
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,200
 Okay, I'm not, I'm dying, yeah.

586
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,200
 Shakespeare has a young mum joke as well.

587
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
 Does he?

588
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,200
 Yeah, yeah, it's in Titus Andronicus, which is not a very funny play.

589
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,200
 It's pretty serious and people get eaten in pies and things like that.

590
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
 It's incredibly gory.

591
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
 It's one of the early tragedies.

592
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,200
 And I think there's a body count of about 11 by the end.

593
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
 It's so unpleasant.

594
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,200
 But there's a bit where someone says, "I have undone your mother."

595
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,200
 And then the other person says, "Villain, I have done thy mother."

596
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
 And that is a proper your mum joke.

597
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
 That is.

598
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,200
 Yeah, that's straight down the line.

599
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,200
 Someone also said that he has the first knock-knock joke,

600
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
 which is a native of Beth.

601
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,200
 Yeah, but it's very hard to see the joke in it.

602
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
 So I'm skeptical.

603
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
 Does it have the word knock?

604
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
 It has the word knock in it.

605
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
 That's pretty much.

606
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
 It has the word knock-knock.

607
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,200
 It has it over and over again as a scene with the porter.

608
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
 Yes.

609
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
 It's the comic relief in the middle of the play.

610
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
 Oh, yeah.

611
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,200
 So it's more like the comedy comes just from the words knock-knock-knock,

612
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
 doesn't it?

613
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
 The joke hadn't really developed further than that.

614
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
 So he hadn't got to who's there.

615
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
 Who's there?

616
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
 Who reached that?

617
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
 You know, everything starts somewhere, doesn't it?

618
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
 Yeah, sure.

619
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,200
 I was going through a long time ago on "Museum Accuriosity,"

620
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
 the radio show we make.

621
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,200
 Jimmy Carr came on and he gave us his donation to the museum

622
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
 was a book that contained all the jokes in the world.

623
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
 So we did a lot of research on jokes.

624
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
 Well, James did.

625
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
 And I went through the scripts.

626
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
 And I've stolen all his research.

627
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,200
 So I'd like to read you out some of the best bits of research.

628
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
 I'll pretend that I've never heard it before.

629
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
 Yeah, exactly.

630
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
 So who's one that James found?

631
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,200
 So Bob Monkowski, a very famous comedian in Britain,

632
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
 passed away.

633
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,200
 He wanted to write the ultimate joke and he told us to Dennis Norden,

634
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
 another massive name in British comedy history.

635
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,200
 And Norden kept checking back on him every few years to say

636
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
 how far have you got with the ultimate joke?

637
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
 And years and years down the line.

638
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
 He did say, not very far.

639
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
 I do have the opening line though.

640
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
 I know what that is.

641
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
 And the opening line for the world's ultimate joke

642
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
 was a man walks into a chemist.

643
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
 That's as far as he got.

644
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,200
 So we never know if he made it any further than that.

645
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
 I can see that works because halfway through

646
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
 you think it's going to be bar and then suddenly chemist.

647
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
 Yes.

648
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
 It does work.

649
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
 I'm already laughing.

650
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
 Yeah.

651
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,200
 On the inside.

652
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,200
 But I am off balance enough to really laugh at something

653
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
 in the next line.

654
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
 Yeah, exactly.

655
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
 Yeah, yeah.

656
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
 Here's another one.

657
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
 James found.

658
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
 So a German psychologist found that we laughed more

659
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
 in the 1950s than we do now.

660
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,200
 So in the 1950s we used to laugh for 18 minutes a day.

661
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,200
 And these days we laugh for six minutes a day.

662
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
 And then James added in the notes, by the way,

663
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
 if you don't find this interesting,

664
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
 this might get a laugh.

665
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
 The psychologist was called Dr. Michael Titz.

666
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,200
 18 minutes a day.

667
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,200
 There's a lot of time to spend laughing.

668
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
 Yeah.

669
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,200
 I spent 4040 minutes that day laughing at the name Titz.

670
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
 Exactly.

671
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,200
 James brought the average for the whole year.

672
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,200
 Has anyone seen the jokes written by computers?

673
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
 No.

674
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
 So there's a website.

675
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
 I don't know what the site's called.

676
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,200
 Jokingcomputer, I think, but it's a-b-d-n-dot-ac.uk/jokingcomputer.

677
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
 And the computer comes up with jokes,

678
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,200
 which are terrible puns that don't really work.

679
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,200
 How is a tender food different from an additional support?

680
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
 One is a sore meat.

681
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
 The other is a more seat.

682
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,200
 It does work as a joke.

683
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
 Kind of does.

684
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,200
 Well, you would never say this is too sore this meat.

685
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
 That's true.

686
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,200
 I wouldn't say I'm in a restaurant.

687
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,200
 You'd probably get kicked out.

688
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
 This is one that I don't really understand.

689
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,200
 What do you call an aquatics with a saint's John?

690
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
 A sweet mane.

691
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
 Okay.

692
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,200
 So there's a button where you can press why is this a joke?

693
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,200
 And it says swimming is a kind of aquatics.

694
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
 Do you agree or disagree?

695
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
 And I agree with that.

696
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
 Okay.

697
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,200
 And it says, "Main" sounds like the end of swimming.

698
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
 Almost.

699
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
 I put disagree with that.

700
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,200
 And then a saint's John can be a part of a mane.

701
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
 I really don't understand that at all.

702
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
 Is it a town in the state of Maine?

703
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,200
 Oh, that's possible.

704
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
 Yeah.

705
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
 Anyway, it didn't really work for me.

706
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
 That's where it falls down.

707
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,200
 Someone needs to explain to that computer that if you tell a joke

708
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
 and then you immediately need to explain it,

709
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
 it's not a good joke.

710
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
 It needs to remove that button immediately.

711
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
 That's true.

712
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,200
 Although I think by me disagreeing with those things

713
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
 it helps it to make jokes in the future.

714
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
 Oh, that's so good of you.

715
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
 You've done it a lot of it.

716
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
 Well, I like to do my bit.

717
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,200
 I was looking into, there's a famous joke that St Gregory made

718
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,200
 where he saw, he was in Rome and he saw some angle boys

719
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
 as in angles and Anglo-Saxons.

720
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
 Okay.

721
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,200
 And he said non-angly said angely, not angles, but angels.

722
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
 Oh, yeah.

723
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,200
 Because they were so fair-head and so pretty looking and all of this.

724
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
 And supposedly he said, "Well, let's go and convert England

725
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,200
 or let's go and convert England to Catholic Roman Christianity."

726
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,200
 So this got me on to reading about things that were sins

727
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
 in the 8th to 11th centuries.

728
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,200
 And there were big sins that you could commit.

729
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,200
 It was a sin in the 8th century to see your wife naked.

730
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
 Really?

731
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
 Yep.

732
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
 There was an archbishop of Canterbury called Theodore

733
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,200
 and he had a penitential, which is basically a huge list of sins

734
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
 and punishments for sins.

735
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
 So lots of them are sex related, so sex would be behind,

736
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,200
 not allowed, or all sex really bad, the worst of all sins.

737
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
 It's all sex.

738
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,200
 But, right, if you have sex with a nun, you have to go on a fast for four years.

739
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,200
 If your wife cheats on you and you divorce her and you remarry,

740
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,200
 you then have to do a hard penance of seven years for remarrying somebody else.

741
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,200
 But even if you forgive your wife, you either have to not have sex with her

742
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,200
 until her penance is over, or you have to do penance for two years

743
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,200
 because you're having sex with someone who's an adulteress.

744
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,200
 Do you think, so whenever someone's wife or husband cheated on them,

745
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,200
 did they have to open up this vast law book and work out exactly the course they'd take

746
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
 to avoid being arrested?

747
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
 Wait a minute.

748
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,200
 So, when you cheast on me, did you do it from behind?

749
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,200
 Because that's subsection 8b.

750
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,200
 As she's speaking of the angles, they had some good jokes.

751
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,200
 The oldest Anglo-Saxon joke, I think, might be the best old joke I've come across.

752
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
 Oh, yeah.

753
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
 Okay.

754
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,200
 You're building it up a bit there, Anna.

755
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
 That's a real error, isn't it?

756
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
 Yeah.

757
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,200
 So, the oldest Anglo-Saxon joke is, what hangs the demands thigh

758
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,200
 and wants to poke the hole that it's often poked before?

759
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
 A penis.

760
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,200
 A penis.

761
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
 A penis.

762
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
 I would've said a key.

763
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
 It's a key.

764
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
 Oh, nice.

765
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,200
 That's why I keep needing to ring the emergency locksmith.

766
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,200
 Can you grade me another one that looks exactly like this?

767
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,200
 Yes, it is a child, actually.

768
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
 Okay.

769
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,200
 That's it.

770
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
 That's all of our facts.

771
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
