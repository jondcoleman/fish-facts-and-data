00:00:00,00:00:11,We're going to go to the next room to take a look at what we're going to do.
00:00:11,00:00:15,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:15,00:00:18,coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:18,00:00:19,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:19,00:00:23,"I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray."
00:00:23,00:00:27,And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the
00:00:27,00:00:32,"last seven days and in a particular order, here we go, starting with you, James."
00:00:32,00:00:37,"Okay, my fact this week is that in 1921, the news of the world offered a free tea tray"
00:00:37,00:00:41,to any mother on the birth of her 10th child.
00:00:41,00:00:43,Why was it doing that?
00:00:43,00:00:49,"Well, the reason was it had just been the war and also there was contraception, widespreadly"
00:00:49,00:00:54,"available now, which there wasn't before, and the newspapers had a bit of a kind of moral"
00:00:54,00:01:00,crisis about the being not enough children in the UK and so they wanted to encourage children.
00:01:00,00:01:04,"The daily express, for instance, had a Britain's largest family competition at the same time."
00:01:04,00:01:10,"But the idea of the news of the world was that a woman would genuinely be induced to think,"
00:01:10,00:01:12,"""Actually, I won't stop at three."
00:01:12,00:01:16,"I'll go all the way up to 10 children because once I get to 10, I'll get a tea tray."""
00:01:16,00:01:18,"It's interesting, isn't it?"
00:01:18,00:01:19,What stage?
00:01:19,00:01:20,After how many children do you go?
00:01:20,00:01:23,I might as well carry on for the tea tray now.
00:01:23,00:01:29,"I have a theory that the unless tea trays have massively depreciated in value, the cost"
00:01:29,00:01:35,of rearing a child would not be offset by the value of the tea tray.
00:01:35,00:01:37,"I think that's pretty solid theory, actually."
00:01:37,00:01:38,Do you think that's solid economics?
00:01:38,00:01:41,"Well, how often they made, I wonder how many tea trays they had to give away."
00:01:41,00:01:44,"Do you think they just no one actually went for it because in the end, it's only a tea"
00:01:44,00:01:47,"tray and when the news of the world shut down, what they had to clear out of their offices"
00:01:47,00:01:48,"were 50,000 tea trays."
00:01:48,00:01:53,"That's a good point though, when did that deal expire?"
00:01:53,00:01:56,"If they're running the competition for a year, say it, only applies to people who realistically"
00:01:56,00:02:01,got nine children and can get pregnant within the next three months.
00:02:01,00:02:05,Maybe it was running all the way until the news of the world closed last year or the year
00:02:05,00:02:06,before.
00:02:06,00:02:07,Maybe that's what sent them down.
00:02:07,00:02:10,Some have finally claimed the tea tray.
00:02:10,00:02:12,"No, it was massive phone hacking."
00:02:12,00:02:13,"Yeah, let's be clear."
00:02:13,00:02:17,"We should, for overseas listeners, news of the world was a massive newspaper here."
00:02:17,00:02:23,It came out every Sunday and they got caught for a big hacking scandal of people's mobile
00:02:23,00:02:26,phones and so Rupert Muradalk had to shut it down.
00:02:26,00:02:27,There was so much pressure.
00:02:27,00:02:31,I was looking into things that had been given away for free.
00:02:31,00:02:34,Here's one free thing that was given away that I'm very annoyed to learn because I've found
00:02:34,00:02:36,out it's no longer going.
00:02:36,00:02:43,"But Etti had had a promotion whereby if it rained while you were in Abu Dhabi, you would"
00:02:43,00:02:45,get a free trip off the back of it.
00:02:45,00:02:49,It had a guarantee sunshine or your next holiday free.
00:02:49,00:02:51,"You're going to Abu Dhabi soon, aren't you?"
00:02:51,00:02:52,"Yeah, I'm going in about two weeks."
00:02:52,00:02:56,"Well, maybe if you say Etti had enough time, you said, ""Well, you get a free trip, I do love"
00:02:56,00:02:57,"Etti had."""
00:02:57,00:02:58,"So, who was the company?"
00:02:58,00:02:59,Etti had.
00:02:59,00:03:00,Right.
00:03:00,00:03:01,What do they do?
00:03:01,00:03:02,They're an airline.
00:03:02,00:03:03,They're an airline.
00:03:03,00:03:04,They're the best out there.
00:03:04,00:03:05,"Actually, they've been voted number one airline."
00:03:05,00:03:06,"Actually, I think they're awful."
00:03:06,00:03:10,Good luck getting that free trip down.
00:03:10,00:03:12,Have you guys had a newspaper insurance?
00:03:12,00:03:13,No.
00:03:13,00:03:19,"If you subscribed and you got a medical condition, the newspaper would pay you some money and"
00:03:19,00:03:25,they would print massive columns full of people who had won money or been given money.
00:03:25,00:03:29,"So, in 1922, if you've got appendicitis and you're subscribed to the Express, you get"
00:03:29,00:03:31,"a tenor, which is quite a lot of money."
00:03:31,00:03:32,Wow.
00:03:32,00:03:33,Yeah.
00:03:33,00:03:34,When?
00:03:34,00:03:35,How long ago?
00:03:35,00:03:36,This is the 20s.
00:03:36,00:03:37,And a tenor of today's money or...
00:03:37,00:03:38,No.
00:03:38,00:03:39,Back then.
00:03:39,00:03:40,"No, no, no."
00:03:40,00:03:41,How much today's money was?
00:03:41,00:03:44,"Same travel to the future, they were so rich in those days."
00:03:44,00:03:45,Amazing.
00:03:45,00:03:51,"Actually, one of the earliest newspapers was called ""Ikabod Dorks Newsletter."""
00:03:51,00:03:52,I think this...
00:03:52,00:03:53,Your works?
00:03:53,00:03:57,"That's one of these things I wrote down, but completely fine."
00:03:57,00:04:01,"It's DAWK, so there's nothing funny about that at all, actually."
00:04:01,00:04:02,"You can't get many ""Ikabods"" these days."
00:04:02,00:04:04,I think it's a very nice name.
00:04:04,00:04:05,I think so as well.
00:04:05,00:04:09,"If you're about to have your tenor child, why not call it ""Ikabod""?"
00:04:09,00:04:12,People send you a free no such thing as a fish mug.
00:04:12,00:04:13,We'll genuinely do it.
00:04:13,00:04:14,"We can promise that, right?"
00:04:14,00:04:15,"Yeah, we can promise that."
00:04:15,00:04:16,Okay.
00:04:16,00:04:17,We need evidence.
00:04:17,00:04:18,We need a birth certificate.
00:04:18,00:04:19,Yeah.
00:04:19,00:04:20,The price of rearing the baby.
00:04:20,00:04:22,Do you think that's going to be offset by the price of a no such thing as a fish mug?
00:04:22,00:04:23,They are extremely valuable.
00:04:23,00:04:25,There's always one of them in the world at the moment.
00:04:25,00:04:26,"There's one in the world, yeah."
00:04:26,00:04:27,I should finish this off.
00:04:27,00:04:32,"So Mr. Dorks Newsletter was one of the first newspapers, and it came with a blank space"
00:04:32,00:04:36,"in every edition so that you could buy it, and then the blank space was for you to write"
00:04:36,00:04:39,"your own personal news, because then you'd send it to your friends and relatives."
00:04:39,00:04:40,That's a really good idea.
00:04:40,00:04:41,"Yeah, it's such a good idea."
00:04:41,00:04:43,Because people would share newspapers.
00:04:43,00:04:47,"It used to be that one newspaper, people estimate it would be read by about 20 to 30 people."
00:04:47,00:04:48,Yeah.
00:04:48,00:04:49,Yeah.
00:04:49,00:04:50,"Because often it was read out loud as well, isn't it?"
00:04:50,00:04:55,"I missed those days, because I didn't actually live in the 19th century, but I would, if I had,"
00:04:55,00:05:00,"miss those days when there would be a literate person, and then people who couldn't read"
00:05:00,00:05:03,"as well, or people who just wanted to hear the newspaper read out."
00:05:03,00:05:07,"And they all crowd around and clamor to have the news read out in the 19th century, and then"
00:05:07,00:05:08,someone would read it out.
00:05:08,00:05:09,Wouldn't that be great?
00:05:09,00:05:14,"I can't imagine sitting down in the 19th century with your grandfather on his chair, and he opens"
00:05:14,00:05:17,"up the newspaper, says, ""Gather round everyone, gather round."""
00:05:17,00:05:20,It's how he's star in three-in-a-bed rom.
00:05:20,00:05:21,"Yeah, true."
00:05:21,00:05:26,"This is the thing about the news of the world, is that it was a crime newspaper for the first"
00:05:26,00:05:27,few decades.
00:05:27,00:05:28,Yeah.
00:05:28,00:05:33,"Are they specialised in gruesome murders, and also in Vickers court in impropriety and things"
00:05:33,00:05:34,like that?
00:05:34,00:05:37,"Yeah, the news of the world was always trashy and scandalous."
00:05:37,00:05:40,"It wasn't because I thought maybe you'd read back into its history, and you'd find out that"
00:05:40,00:05:44,"it used to be a well-respected paper, but it was always, yeah, really gossipy and full of"
00:05:44,00:05:46,lured things and murders.
00:05:46,00:05:51,"And at the very start of the 20th century, the editor of the Palma Gazette, I think, a more"
00:05:51,00:05:58,"paper who was called Frederick Greenwood, went up to the editor of the news of the world and said,"
00:05:58,00:06:02,"""He'd looked at the paper once, and then he'd immediately put it in his waste paper basket."""
00:06:02,00:06:07,"And then he thought, ""If I leave it there, the cook may read it, so I burned it."""
00:06:07,00:06:12,"There was a bloke who a couple years ago found a first edition of the news of the world,"
00:06:12,00:06:13,which was in 1843.
00:06:13,00:06:18,"He was called William March, age 72, and he found it in his attic."
00:06:18,00:06:21,"He said, ""I was just clearing stuff out, and I just found it there."
00:06:21,00:06:23,"I was going to dump it, but then I saw the date."
00:06:23,00:06:26,"It cost just three pence, and it's just eight pages."
00:06:26,00:06:30,"I have looked through it, and it is a bit boring."""
00:06:30,00:06:37,"They used to be newspapers or magazines, which were exclusively for Lonely Hearts Adverts,"
00:06:37,00:06:39,all the way through the 19th century.
00:06:39,00:06:44,"So the first one was called Matrimonial News, and then it was followed in rapid succession by"
00:06:44,00:06:48,"the marriage gazette, matrimonial times, matrimonial record, matrimonial herald,"
00:06:48,00:06:52,"aristocratic matrimonial, marriage envoy, marriage advertiser,"
00:06:52,00:06:55,"matrimonial chronicle, matrimonial world, matrimonial courier,"
00:06:55,00:06:59,"honeymoon, matrimonial intelligence here, and matrimonial register."
00:06:59,00:07:02,"Ironically, all bought by people who weren't married."
00:07:02,00:07:03,Exactly!
00:07:03,00:07:04,What a misnomer!
00:07:04,00:07:08,Why aren't there some desperate singleton gazettes?
00:07:12,00:07:17,"Okay, time for fact number two, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:07:17,00:07:25,"My fact is that Belgian fishermen go fishing on horseback, and they drown in their thousands."
00:07:25,00:07:26,Do they?
00:07:26,00:07:27,"No, they don't."
00:07:27,00:07:30,"They fish just on the coast, and they're fishing for shrimp."
00:07:30,00:07:33,"Okay, so they're not on like big boats on horseback."
00:07:33,00:07:36,"I'll be honest, I thought in the river rather than on the coast,"
00:07:36,00:07:38,I'm even surprised that it's on the coast.
00:07:38,00:07:40,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, and they have really, really strong horses,"
00:07:40,00:07:42,"because the horses are up to the top of their legs and more so,"
00:07:42,00:07:44,"and obviously that's quite hard to wade through that,"
00:07:44,00:07:46,"especially if you're a horse, and you've got more legs."
00:07:46,00:07:49,And then once you're dealing with the vast weight of shrimps on top of that?
00:07:49,00:07:51,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:51,00:07:54,"And so they pull a net behind them, and they also pull a chain in front of the net,"
00:07:54,00:07:56,"and the chain stirs up the shrimps, and it frightens them a bit,"
00:07:56,00:07:58,and it means they flee into the net.
00:07:58,00:07:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:59,00:08:00,"And then you have, yeah."
00:08:00,00:08:02,"And not many people do this anymore, unfortunately,"
00:08:02,00:08:06,"i.e. 12 households do it still,"
00:08:06,00:08:08,because it's not very profitable anymore.
00:08:08,00:08:11,And are they using rods or spears?
00:08:11,00:08:13,"No, they're using neither."
00:08:13,00:08:15,Why would it be rods or spears?
00:08:15,00:08:18,"Oh, I thought they would be looking at the fish, swimming past them,"
00:08:18,00:08:19,and they would...
00:08:19,00:08:21,"Or they would sit there with a rod, just fishing."
00:08:21,00:08:23,Have you ever tried to spear a shrimp?
00:08:23,00:08:26,You've got a really good aim.
00:08:26,00:08:27,"That's true, yeah."
00:08:27,00:08:29,"You know, all skewed kebabs."
00:08:29,00:08:31,"That's how they make them, yeah."
00:08:31,00:08:33,"It's really annoying, because you have to wait for them to line up"
00:08:33,00:08:36,"in just the right order, and then to spear them."
00:08:36,00:08:38,So some of the ways of catching fish?
00:08:38,00:08:39,Yeah.
00:08:39,00:08:40,And there's some good ones in America.
00:08:40,00:08:42,They had a thing called telephoning.
00:08:42,00:08:44,What you would do is you would take a telephone off the wall.
00:08:44,00:08:46,"They had like a magnetic coil in there,"
00:08:46,00:08:49,"and you would kind of ramp that up, and so it got electric."
00:08:49,00:08:51,"And then you would put the wires in the water,"
00:08:51,00:08:54,"stun all of the fish, and then just grab them."
00:08:54,00:08:56,"And then what people would do was then get the phone,"
00:08:56,00:08:58,"put it back on the wall, and ring their friends up to say,"
00:08:58,00:08:59,"""Guess what I've done today."""
00:08:59,00:09:00,No.
00:09:00,00:09:03,Another one is called catfisting.
00:09:03,00:09:04,What?
00:09:04,00:09:05,No.
00:09:05,00:09:08,"Yeah, catfisting, and that is exactly what it sounds like."
00:09:08,00:09:10,I don't think you can be exactly what it is.
00:09:10,00:09:14,"You put your fist into the water, and the catfish kind of grabs onto it,"
00:09:14,00:09:17,"and then you pull your fist out, and the catfish is on your hand,"
00:09:17,00:09:19,so you're using your fist as bait.
00:09:19,00:09:22,"I had the opposite in my head, in that you fist a cat."
00:09:22,00:09:26,"You put that under the water, and the cat catches a fish."
00:09:26,00:09:29,So I was really close.
00:09:29,00:09:31,"You were so close, Dad, yeah."
00:09:31,00:09:32,But cats love fish.
00:09:32,00:09:34,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking."
00:09:34,00:09:37,"So they're kind of jointly hating it, and loving it at the same time."
00:09:37,00:09:39,It's a roller coaster of emotions.
00:09:39,00:09:40,"That's also noodling, isn't it?"
00:09:40,00:09:43,"And I think that's really dangerous, because it often involves diving"
00:09:43,00:09:47,"to quite low depths, because the catfish live in holes,"
00:09:47,00:09:51,"and you dive to low depths, and I think people drown or they get."
00:09:51,00:09:53,I think it's got a high injury rate.
00:09:53,00:09:57,"Well, it's a good thing that cats have nine lives, in that case."
00:09:57,00:10:00,You can catch eight catfish.
00:10:00,00:10:03,"I have a couple of things on Belgium, and I really like this."
00:10:03,00:10:06,"Now, I think, like how you're saying, there's only about 12 families left"
00:10:06,00:10:07,that do this kind of thing.
00:10:07,00:10:11,"I don't know if this is a national sport, but it's certainly been documented."
00:10:11,00:10:13,"It's called ""Shit Yourself Rich."""
00:10:13,00:10:15,And it's a really cool idea.
00:10:15,00:10:19,"The sport involves, you divide a field up into an imaginary grid,"
00:10:19,00:10:24,"and everyone starts having a bet where the cow in that field will have a poo,"
00:10:24,00:10:26,and whoever gets it right then gets the money.
00:10:26,00:10:31,"So it's basically a lot of Belgians watching a cow in a field waiting for it to poo,"
00:10:31,00:10:34,with money riding on the spot that it's going to go in.
00:10:34,00:10:36,I have a feeling that might have happened in Britain as well.
00:10:36,00:10:38,"I've heard about it a few times, yeah."
00:10:38,00:10:40,"And it's just basically a lottery kind of thing, isn't it?"
00:10:40,00:10:41,Yeah.
00:10:41,00:10:44,"Also, I've read that Belgium is the largest exporter of billiard balls."
00:10:44,00:10:46,It's quite cool.
00:10:46,00:10:48,80% of the world's billiard balls are made in Belgium.
00:10:48,00:10:49,Really?
00:10:49,00:10:50,Wow!
00:10:50,00:10:51,Really odd.
00:10:51,00:10:56,It reminds me of that fact that most of the world's false teeth come from Lichtenstein.
00:10:56,00:10:57,Really?
00:10:57,00:11:03,"I was reading an adventure book for boys that was written in 1890,"
00:11:03,00:11:07,and it recommends goose fishing.
00:11:07,00:11:10,"Oh, I think you mean goose fishing, isn't it?"
00:11:10,00:11:14,"Yeah, so you use goose fishermen, they're called,"
00:11:14,00:11:17,"and it recommends that you just tie a fishing line and hook to a goose's leg,"
00:11:17,00:11:21,"and then you drive the goose into the water, and that works as a fisherman."
00:11:21,00:11:24,"And it just swims along, and it's got bait on the end."
00:11:24,00:11:26,"And as soon as the goose feels a fish pulling on his leg,"
00:11:26,00:11:29,"it gets a bit distressed because the fish is trying to pull it underwater,"
00:11:29,00:11:31,"and it swims back to the shore, and it brings the fish with it,"
00:11:31,00:11:33,"and then you unhook it, and there you go."
00:11:33,00:11:34,You haven't had to do anything.
00:11:34,00:11:35,Wow.
00:11:35,00:11:36,That's pretty ingenious.
00:11:36,00:11:40,"Do you know, it's really hard for us to tell how fast fish swim."
00:11:40,00:11:41,What?
00:11:41,00:11:44,"Well, it's really, how do you know what the fastest fish is?"
00:11:44,00:11:47,How can you measure speed of fish?
00:11:47,00:11:49,"I guess it's hard to see them under the water,"
00:11:49,00:11:51,"and then you'd have to be going at the same speed as them,"
00:11:51,00:11:53,"otherwise they're just, you know, two miles away,"
00:11:53,00:11:56,"and you're still sitting your boat, you don't know where they are."
00:11:56,00:11:57,Yeah.
00:11:57,00:12:01,So what they do do is this is a thing that's been set up
00:12:01,00:12:04,"amongst professional fishermen is that when they've caught something,"
00:12:04,00:12:07,"they start measuring how fast the reel goes out,"
00:12:07,00:12:11,"so the speed of the reel, and then they log that time."
00:12:11,00:12:14,"So they found, so far, in any of these experiments,"
00:12:14,00:12:16,"that the fastest fish is the sailfish,"
00:12:16,00:12:21,"and it took out a 300 feet of line, a fishing line, in three seconds."
00:12:21,00:12:25,So it went from zero to 60 in 2.6 seconds.
00:12:25,00:12:26,That is incredible.
00:12:26,00:12:29,"Although I guess these fish, they've just been caught, haven't they?"
00:12:29,00:12:33,"And they're trying to escape, so it's not like a normal fish would go that fast, maybe."
00:12:33,00:12:37,"Yeah, so maybe we could improve human 100 meter times by..."
00:12:37,00:12:40,"The guy shooting the gun to start, start pointing it out."
00:12:40,00:12:42,That's the way to do it.
00:12:42,00:12:43,"But yeah, that's interesting."
00:12:43,00:12:44,I had no idea.
00:12:44,00:12:46,I assumed that we just knew what the fastest fish was.
00:12:46,00:12:48,"Yeah, I would assume we'd tag them."
00:12:48,00:12:52,"Well, they are swimming faster fish in response to human fishing."
00:12:52,00:12:54,"So... Yeah, sensible."
00:12:54,00:12:57,"Well, the fish... If you are chasing a fish with a net,"
00:12:57,00:13:00,"which sometimes happens, you've got a, you know,"
00:13:00,00:13:02,"trying to out swim a net, basically."
00:13:02,00:13:05,"The slower fish will be caught, and then the faster fish will survive,"
00:13:05,00:13:07,and then they're more likely to breed.
00:13:07,00:13:11,So we might actually change fish physiology just by fishing for them.
00:13:11,00:13:15,"Might they get stronger because the stronger ones manage to wriggle out of the nets,"
00:13:15,00:13:19,"and the weaker ones get caught, and then eventually you've got massively fast,"
00:13:19,00:13:21,super strong fish.
00:13:21,00:13:23,Eventually the fish will be catching us.
00:13:23,00:13:25,"No, they'll be fishing for humans."
00:13:25,00:13:30,"We'll just see these rods coming out of the water, onto the land, dragging us in."
00:13:30,00:13:34,The dystopia I see before me.
00:13:34,00:13:36,You see a cat?
00:13:36,00:13:39,"Just the adorable cat, and you go over to pet it,"
00:13:39,00:13:42,and then you see it's got a fin poking out at the end of it.
00:13:42,00:13:49,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:13:49,00:13:55,My fact this week is that 68% of mountains don't have pointy peaks.
00:13:55,00:13:57,So what does that mean?
00:13:57,00:14:00,"Does it mean like, like, table mountain, it has a flat top?"
00:14:00,00:14:03,"Yeah, yeah, so I guess any time you draw a mountain,"
00:14:03,00:14:06,"if we were drawing a mountain, we would give it a pointy peak, right?"
00:14:06,00:14:08,And so this is why this fact really surprised me.
00:14:08,00:14:10,I just assumed that it's going to have a pointy peak.
00:14:10,00:14:15,"Some guys at Princeton University, Paul Elson and Morgan Tingley,"
00:14:15,00:14:20,"decided that they wanted to do a survey and see how many mountains do, in fact, have pointy peaks."
00:14:20,00:14:25,"So they did a, they took satellite data from 182 mountain ranges around the world,"
00:14:25,00:14:30,"and they looked at it, and they discovered that 68% of these mountains didn't have a pointy peak."
00:14:30,00:14:31,So that's a sort of...
00:14:31,00:14:34,"So I think the definition of pointy peak is important here,"
00:14:34,00:14:37,"because I wasn't that surprised at first, because I thought, well, no mountain peaks."
00:14:37,00:14:42,"Because every time you climb a mountain, you're not kind of balancing the little kind of pointy."
00:14:42,00:14:46,I always pierce my foot and top step.
00:14:46,00:14:49,"So it's actually more interesting, even than it sounds, I think,"
00:14:49,00:14:56,"because the guys who did the study define pointy peak or define a pyramid-shaped mountain,"
00:14:56,00:15:00,"as just a mountain whose area steadily decreases as it goes up, right?"
00:15:00,00:15:04,"So as a mountain whose sides just steadily move towards each other,"
00:15:04,00:15:08,so it doesn't mean that the peak has to be as sharp as a needle.
00:15:08,00:15:10,So it could be a ziggurat's wrap and the pyramid?
00:15:10,00:15:13,"Exactly, it could be a ziggurat."
00:15:13,00:15:15,It's like a pyramid with a flat top.
00:15:15,00:15:16,"Yeah, okay."
00:15:16,00:15:18,"Yeah, so you could have a flat top, exactly."
00:15:18,00:15:24,"And what they found is, I think, that actually mountains often have an hourglass shape,"
00:15:24,00:15:28,"so their area would start off big, and then it would get smaller as it went up,"
00:15:28,00:15:33,"but then it would increase again, and then sometimes they'd be inverted pyramids,"
00:15:33,00:15:34,where I think...
00:15:34,00:15:35,Is that incredible?
00:15:35,00:15:36,This is amazing.
00:15:36,00:15:37,That is rubbish.
00:15:37,00:15:40,"Well, that's much less cool than it sounds though, right?"
00:15:40,00:15:42,Because it's not like an upside-down pyramid.
00:15:42,00:15:44,It's not like it's an excited point on the ground.
00:15:44,00:15:46,"Yeah, and where it gets way outward."
00:15:46,00:15:52,"It's where it gets less and less steep, so it doesn't consistently go up like pyramids."
00:15:52,00:15:53,"Oh, that's interesting."
00:15:53,00:15:54,Yeah.
00:15:54,00:15:55,Okay.
00:15:55,00:15:56,"But yeah, and there are..."
00:15:56,00:15:59,"So they found those inverse ones that you're talking about,"
00:15:59,00:16:03,"which is 6% in the survey, were these type."
00:16:03,00:16:05,So that's where the land area increases to the top.
00:16:05,00:16:12,"23% had this hourglass shape, and then 39% had a diamond form, which is really cool."
00:16:12,00:16:16,"So that's less land area at the top and the bottom, so more in the middle."
00:16:16,00:16:19,But where are these mountains that are shaped like diamonds?
00:16:19,00:16:23,"They start at a point on the ground, then they spread out to this massive thing in the middle,"
00:16:23,00:16:24,then they shape...
00:16:24,00:16:27,They don't have much publicity because no one can climb them.
00:16:27,00:16:32,"So one of the things about this study, or one of the things that makes it relevant"
00:16:32,00:16:37,"and not incredibly dubious, they're all mounted to diamond plates."
00:16:37,00:16:40,"But the interesting thing is that as climate change happens,"
00:16:40,00:16:44,"as the planet gets warmer, animals which live in a particular band on a mountain"
00:16:44,00:16:47,are going to be pushed upwards because they're going to be pushed
00:16:47,00:16:48,and where there's the same temperature.
00:16:48,00:16:53,"So some species will benefit where they actually have more surface area higher up,"
00:16:53,00:16:58,"but some of them will, a lot more of them, I think, will suffer as a result"
00:16:58,00:17:01,because you get much smaller habitat for the species to live on.
00:17:01,00:17:05,"They have to hope that they evolve wings and are able to take off from the top,"
00:17:05,00:17:07,won't they? Is that pushed higher and higher up?
00:17:07,00:17:09,They'll be a period where they're just waiting for that to happen.
00:17:09,00:17:10,I imagine.
00:17:10,00:17:11,That's exactly how you fully should work.
00:17:11,00:17:12,Yes.
00:17:12,00:17:14,Where are they going to go when they've grown these wings?
00:17:14,00:17:15,They'll just live up in the air.
00:17:15,00:17:16,I see.
00:17:16,00:17:18,I've got birds to live in a cloud.
00:17:18,00:17:21,"If you'd like to subscribe to Anna's Extreme Optimism magazine,"
00:17:21,00:17:25,have you guys been to the top of mountains?
00:17:25,00:17:26,Some of them.
00:17:26,00:17:31,I just want to do a quick survey of how many of you have done.
00:17:31,00:17:34,I just want to do a tiny survey.
00:17:34,00:17:36,I've only been up one mountain.
00:17:36,00:17:37,I've been up to Ben Nevis.
00:17:37,00:17:39,"Okay, so Ben Nevis is the top light."
00:17:39,00:17:41,It's a scree-like.
00:17:41,00:17:43,What was that mean?
00:17:43,00:17:44,The same as Garpa Mike.
00:17:44,00:17:46,Loose rocks.
00:17:46,00:17:47,Loose rocks.
00:17:47,00:17:49,"And then there's kind of a table thing that you stand on,"
00:17:49,00:17:53,"so people can take your photo so that it's like, yeah, I got to the top."
00:17:53,00:17:54,And you're at the top of the top.
00:17:54,00:17:55,Yeah.
00:17:55,00:17:58,"The only mountain I've been on, which is Mount Cosiosco in Australia."
00:17:58,00:17:59,Do you mean Cosicosco?
00:17:59,00:18:01,That's an interesting misconception of how that is said.
00:18:01,00:18:04,It's actually Mount Cosiosco.
00:18:04,00:18:08,Please write in to tell me how correct I got that.
00:18:08,00:18:09,They have that as well.
00:18:09,00:18:12,They have a little platform that you stand on top of.
00:18:12,00:18:15,Have they artificially added to the height of the mountain?
00:18:15,00:18:16,Yes.
00:18:16,00:18:18,"In a way, yes."
00:18:18,00:18:19,Definitely.
00:18:19,00:18:20,Just on mountains.
00:18:20,00:18:21,Yeah.
00:18:21,00:18:24,"I assume that we had climbed pretty much every mountain, partly because of the song."
00:18:24,00:18:25,Yeah.
00:18:25,00:18:27,She was telling people to climb every mountain.
00:18:27,00:18:33,"Well, the message has not got across because the chairman of the Mount Everest Foundation Committee,"
00:18:33,00:18:39,"Lindsey Griffin, said a few years ago, there are far more unclimbed peaks than climbed ones."
00:18:39,00:18:40,So many more.
00:18:40,00:18:43,"Highest pint in Bhutan, you're not allowed to climb up."
00:18:43,00:18:44,Really?
00:18:44,00:18:48,"Also, there was a thing about Kantchenchunga, which was when people go up there,"
00:18:48,00:18:53,"you're supposed to, there's like a local tradition when you're not supposed to stand on the absolute summit."
00:18:53,00:18:56,So you're supposed to stop like two steps before or something.
00:18:56,00:18:58,And the first people who did it definitely did that.
00:18:58,00:19:02,"And I wonder if everyone who's gone up has kind of stopped just before,"
00:19:02,00:19:03,and whether it's never been climbed.
00:19:03,00:19:04,"It probably has, really."
00:19:04,00:19:11,"The far highest mountains on Earth, Everest, K2, Kantchenchunga and Lotsi were first scaled in 1953,"
00:19:11,00:19:15,"1954, 1955, and 1956, respectively."
00:19:15,00:19:16,Wow.
00:19:16,00:19:17,Why did we keep that up?
00:19:17,00:19:18,Yeah.
00:19:18,00:19:19,Damn it.
00:19:19,00:19:22,We could have counted down all the way to the lowest mountain in the world.
00:19:22,00:19:23,That would have been amazing.
00:19:23,00:19:27,And this suspense would gradually decline and decline and decline.
00:19:27,00:19:29,Eventually you're just climbing a little hill.
00:19:29,00:19:30,Yeah.
00:19:30,00:19:31,"2,550."
00:19:31,00:19:32,Yeah.
00:19:32,00:19:37,This is the thing that would take so long because there are so many thousands of peaks.
00:19:37,00:19:40,Yeah.
00:19:40,00:19:41,I'm surprised that Chimborazu is not seen to be.
00:19:41,00:19:42,Okay.
00:19:42,00:19:47,"So Mount Chimborazu, there's an Ecuador, is the highest point on Earth."
00:19:47,00:19:51,It's 2.4 kilometers higher than Mount Everest because of the shape of the Earth.
00:19:51,00:19:53,Further from the center of the Earth.
00:19:53,00:19:54,Exactly.
00:19:54,00:19:55,Because Earth bulges a bit around the equator.
00:19:55,00:19:56,Exactly.
00:19:56,00:20:04,"So it is by a long mile, well, 2.4 miles, that would be a long mile."
00:20:04,00:20:07,That is the highest spot on Earth.
00:20:07,00:20:11,"And I'm surprised that that's not seen as more of a, because there must be with altitude and with the thinness of air."
00:20:11,00:20:13,That must be more of a challenge to get to the top.
00:20:13,00:20:17,In the 19th century they did think it was the highest for ages they did.
00:20:17,00:20:22,And it was when like Nepal was kind of Westerners couldn't really go there.
00:20:22,00:20:25,And so everyone thought that Chimborazu was the highest.
00:20:25,00:20:26,For quite a long time.
00:20:26,00:20:27,Wow.
00:20:27,00:20:28,That's really interesting.
00:20:28,00:20:29,Yeah.
00:20:29,00:20:30,So it had its day in the sun down.
00:20:30,00:20:31,Yeah.
00:20:31,00:20:32,Don't feel bad for it.
00:20:32,00:20:36,I've discovered a really interesting lady as a result of looking into this stuff about mountains.
00:20:36,00:20:38,Her name is Elizabeth Hawley.
00:20:38,00:20:39,She's in her 90s.
00:20:39,00:20:43,She has lived for over 50 years in the Himalayas.
00:20:43,00:20:49,And she has become the ultimate person for verifying summits that have been made by explorers.
00:20:49,00:20:51,She put together the Himalayan database.
00:20:51,00:20:55,And she's someone who's cracked down on whether or not people are lying about getting to the top.
00:20:55,00:20:59,Because she has an in with all the Sherpas who tell her the truth about what's going on.
00:20:59,00:21:02,Yeah. So she's sussed out a lot of fraud.
00:21:02,00:21:06,And she verified the first ever blind ascent to Everest.
00:21:06,00:21:08,And she's been living there 60 years.
00:21:08,00:21:14,"And she every explorer, if they want to take it seriously, apparently track her down and tell her about their plans"
00:21:14,00:21:18,so that it can be verified in this database that she's been keeping for 60 years.
00:21:18,00:21:22,I wonder if she has a guy called Morris Wilson on her list.
00:21:22,00:21:28,He was a guy in the 1930s who thought that mysticism and prayer would help him to climb Everest.
00:21:28,00:21:29,That didn't work.
00:21:29,00:21:34,And so what he decided to do was to fly a plane and crash it just below the top of Everest
00:21:34,00:21:36,and then walk up the last few feet.
00:21:36,00:21:38,How far did he get with that?
00:21:38,00:21:41,"Well, the first time he got as far as Bradford."
00:21:41,00:21:43,[laughter]
00:21:43,00:21:45,"Well, he crashed into a field."
00:21:45,00:21:47,And so then the air ministry banned him from flying.
00:21:47,00:21:49,But he just did it anyway.
00:21:49,00:21:51,And he managed to get as far as Tarjeeling.
00:21:51,00:21:56,"And actually, he did fly his plane to Everest and he did crash it."
00:21:56,00:21:59,"It seems like he died before, well, he definitely died."
00:21:59,00:22:01,When was this?
00:22:01,00:22:02,1930s.
00:22:02,00:22:06,Did he ever get out plan for getting out of the plane before it crashed into the mountain?
00:22:06,00:22:07,I think so.
00:22:07,00:22:10,I think he would kind of just jump out with a parachute or something.
00:22:10,00:22:13,"But then kind of thought, well, I'll just walk up to the top then, that'll be fine."
00:22:13,00:22:16,"And then the way down, I mean, how hard can it be to go down?"
00:22:16,00:22:22,"Where is the largest mountain so far as we know in the universe or the solar system, let's say?"
00:22:22,00:22:23,Mars.
00:22:23,00:22:24,It was.
00:22:24,00:22:25,It's been taken over now.
00:22:25,00:22:26,Olympic mons in Mars.
00:22:26,00:22:27,Olympic.
00:22:27,00:22:28,"Yeah, exactly."
00:22:28,00:22:29,It's been taken over.
00:22:29,00:22:34,So it's now a rear-sylvia on an asteroid called four-vester.
00:22:34,00:22:36,And it's about half the size of the moon.
00:22:36,00:22:39,"So it's traveling, hurtling through the universe, the tallest mountain."
00:22:39,00:22:40,Wow.
00:22:40,00:22:41,Yeah.
00:22:41,00:22:42,It's now awesome.
00:22:42,00:22:43,That's very cool.
00:22:43,00:22:45,I hope it doesn't impale us on its sharp point.
00:22:45,00:22:47,Do we know what kind of shape it is?
00:22:47,00:22:51,"I mean, the odds are actually 68% that it doesn't have a sharp point."
00:22:51,00:23:00,It's probably a diamond or an oblate's ferroid or a rhombus mountain.
00:23:00,00:23:03,"OK, it is time for a final fact of the show."
00:23:03,00:23:04,And that is Anna.
00:23:04,00:23:12,My fact is that the oldest your mum joke appears on a 3500-year-old Babylonian tablet.
00:23:12,00:23:14,And it's an absolute cracker.
00:23:14,00:23:20,Is it your mum's so old she appears on a 3500-year-old Babylonian tablet?
00:23:20,00:23:23,So what is the joke itself?
00:23:23,00:23:26,"Well, there's a minor problem in that we don't have the first half of it."
00:23:26,00:23:29,Does it not begin with your mum?
00:23:29,00:23:30,It doesn't.
00:23:30,00:23:31,Your mum features actually a little bit later.
00:23:31,00:23:32,As a punchline.
00:23:32,00:23:35,"Yeah, so we have a missing part."
00:23:35,00:23:40,And then we have the words of your mother is by the one who has sex with her.
00:23:40,00:23:41,Who is it?
00:23:41,00:23:42,Wow.
00:23:42,00:23:48,It sounds like a mixture between the first ever your mum a joke and the first ever knock-knock joke.
00:23:48,00:23:51,And then you have your mother is by the one that has sex with her.
00:23:51,00:23:52,Who?
00:23:52,00:23:57,"So are they known to be full of jokes, Kuneiform tablets?"
00:23:57,00:24:00,"Hilarious, yeah, everything in Kuneiform was a joke."
00:24:00,00:24:03,"No, but there is this tablet that was found in the 70s, I think,"
00:24:03,00:24:07,"but has only recently been analysed, which is full of these riddles and these jokes,"
00:24:07,00:24:08,which are quite difficult.
00:24:08,00:24:11,"If anyone can understand the humour in them, then write in."
00:24:11,00:24:17,"The other one reads, the defloured girl did not become pregnant, the undefloured girl became pregnant."
00:24:17,00:24:18,What is it?
00:24:18,00:24:23,And the answer is auxiliary forces.
00:24:23,00:24:25,"See, that kills."
00:24:25,00:24:28,I should open with that one.
00:24:28,00:24:30,I'm obviously missing something here.
00:24:30,00:24:32,"That's too high-brow for me, clearly."
00:24:32,00:24:35,Do you know there's your mum joking the Bible?
00:24:35,00:24:37,It's a book of kings.
00:24:37,00:24:39,And I'll read it out.
00:24:39,00:24:42,"When Joram saw Jehu, he said,"
00:24:42,00:24:44,"""Is it peace, Jehu?"""
00:24:44,00:24:45,"And he answered,"
00:24:45,00:24:50,"""What peace, so long as the harlot trees of your mother, Jezebel and her witchcraft are so many."""
00:24:50,00:24:51,Whoa!
00:24:51,00:24:52,That is a good one.
00:24:52,00:24:53,Yeah.
00:24:53,00:24:55,And then from this side of the table.
00:24:55,00:24:58,We're more into our Babylonian your mum's jokes.
00:24:58,00:25:02,"It's not really your mum's joke, it's your mum insult, I suppose."
00:25:02,00:25:03,"Yeah, yeah."
00:25:03,00:25:04,"It's a fine line, isn't it?"
00:25:04,00:25:08,"There's an ancient Egyptian joke, so I'm going to test this material on you guys now."
00:25:08,00:25:09,"Yeah, yeah."
00:25:09,00:25:11,How do you entertain a bored Pharaoh?
00:25:11,00:25:12,I don't know.
00:25:12,00:25:14,How do you entertain a bored Pharaoh?
00:25:14,00:25:16,"Is it with a pyramid of um, for a russia?"
00:25:16,00:25:19,"Yes, but it's a pyramid that's shaped like a parallelogram."
00:25:19,00:25:22,"Like most mountains in the world, as we know."
00:25:22,00:25:26,"No, it's, you sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the Nile"
00:25:26,00:25:29,and urge the Pharaoh to go catch a fish.
00:25:29,00:25:32,"Oh, that's the way I tell him."
00:25:32,00:25:33,How do we know about that joke?
00:25:33,00:25:37,"Was that just an extremely long, horrific thing that we've worked it out from?"
00:25:37,00:25:40,"No, it's writing, wasn't in hieroglyphics, it was in what?"
00:25:40,00:25:41,I had this question.
00:25:41,00:25:42,I had this question.
00:25:42,00:25:43,"Oh, yeah, of course, sorry."
00:25:43,00:25:44,Yeah.
00:25:44,00:25:45,"Sorry, ancient Egyptians."
00:25:45,00:25:46,"Okay, one more ancient Egyptian joke."
00:25:46,00:25:47,One more ancient Egyptian joke.
00:25:47,00:25:50,Man is even more eager to copulate than a donkey.
00:25:50,00:25:52,His purse is what restrains him.
00:25:52,00:25:54,"Oh, it's a prostitution joke."
00:25:54,00:25:55,"Yeah, no."
00:25:55,00:25:58,"Okay, I'm not, I'm dying, yeah."
00:25:58,00:26:01,Shakespeare has a young mum joke as well.
00:26:01,00:26:02,Does he?
00:26:02,00:26:05,"Yeah, yeah, it's in Titus Andronicus, which is not a very funny play."
00:26:05,00:26:09,It's pretty serious and people get eaten in pies and things like that.
00:26:09,00:26:10,It's incredibly gory.
00:26:10,00:26:11,It's one of the early tragedies.
00:26:11,00:26:14,And I think there's a body count of about 11 by the end.
00:26:14,00:26:15,It's so unpleasant.
00:26:15,00:26:19,"But there's a bit where someone says, ""I have undone your mother."""
00:26:19,00:26:23,"And then the other person says, ""Villain, I have done thy mother."""
00:26:23,00:26:25,And that is a proper your mum joke.
00:26:25,00:26:26,That is.
00:26:26,00:26:28,"Yeah, that's straight down the line."
00:26:28,00:26:31,"Someone also said that he has the first knock-knock joke,"
00:26:31,00:26:32,which is a native of Beth.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"Yeah, but it's very hard to see the joke in it."
00:26:35,00:26:36,So I'm skeptical.
00:26:36,00:26:37,Does it have the word knock?
00:26:37,00:26:38,It has the word knock in it.
00:26:38,00:26:39,That's pretty much.
00:26:39,00:26:40,It has the word knock-knock.
00:26:40,00:26:43,It has it over and over again as a scene with the porter.
00:26:43,00:26:44,Yes.
00:26:44,00:26:45,It's the comic relief in the middle of the play.
00:26:45,00:26:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:46,00:26:49,"So it's more like the comedy comes just from the words knock-knock-knock,"
00:26:49,00:26:50,doesn't it?
00:26:50,00:26:52,The joke hadn't really developed further than that.
00:26:52,00:26:53,So he hadn't got to who's there.
00:26:53,00:26:54,Who's there?
00:26:54,00:26:56,Who reached that?
00:26:56,00:26:58,"You know, everything starts somewhere, doesn't it?"
00:26:58,00:26:59,"Yeah, sure."
00:26:59,00:27:03,"I was going through a long time ago on ""Museum Accuriosity,"""
00:27:03,00:27:04,the radio show we make.
00:27:04,00:27:08,Jimmy Carr came on and he gave us his donation to the museum
00:27:08,00:27:10,was a book that contained all the jokes in the world.
00:27:10,00:27:12,So we did a lot of research on jokes.
00:27:12,00:27:13,"Well, James did."
00:27:13,00:27:14,And I went through the scripts.
00:27:14,00:27:15,And I've stolen all his research.
00:27:15,00:27:18,So I'd like to read you out some of the best bits of research.
00:27:18,00:27:20,I'll pretend that I've never heard it before.
00:27:20,00:27:21,"Yeah, exactly."
00:27:21,00:27:22,So who's one that James found?
00:27:22,00:27:26,"So Bob Monkowski, a very famous comedian in Britain,"
00:27:26,00:27:27,passed away.
00:27:27,00:27:30,"He wanted to write the ultimate joke and he told us to Dennis Norden,"
00:27:30,00:27:32,another massive name in British comedy history.
00:27:32,00:27:36,And Norden kept checking back on him every few years to say
00:27:36,00:27:38,how far have you got with the ultimate joke?
00:27:38,00:27:40,And years and years down the line.
00:27:40,00:27:42,"He did say, not very far."
00:27:42,00:27:43,I do have the opening line though.
00:27:43,00:27:44,I know what that is.
00:27:44,00:27:46,And the opening line for the world's ultimate joke
00:27:46,00:27:48,was a man walks into a chemist.
00:27:48,00:27:49,That's as far as he got.
00:27:49,00:27:52,So we never know if he made it any further than that.
00:27:52,00:27:54,I can see that works because halfway through
00:27:54,00:27:56,you think it's going to be bar and then suddenly chemist.
00:27:56,00:27:57,Yes.
00:27:57,00:27:58,It does work.
00:27:58,00:27:59,I'm already laughing.
00:27:59,00:28:00,Yeah.
00:28:00,00:28:01,On the inside.
00:28:01,00:28:04,But I am off balance enough to really laugh at something
00:28:04,00:28:05,in the next line.
00:28:05,00:28:06,"Yeah, exactly."
00:28:06,00:28:07,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:07,00:28:08,Here's another one.
00:28:08,00:28:09,James found.
00:28:09,00:28:11,So a German psychologist found that we laughed more
00:28:11,00:28:13,in the 1950s than we do now.
00:28:13,00:28:16,So in the 1950s we used to laugh for 18 minutes a day.
00:28:16,00:28:20,And these days we laugh for six minutes a day.
00:28:20,00:28:22,"And then James added in the notes, by the way,"
00:28:22,00:28:23,"if you don't find this interesting,"
00:28:23,00:28:24,this might get a laugh.
00:28:24,00:28:26,The psychologist was called Dr. Michael Titz.
00:28:26,00:28:29,18 minutes a day.
00:28:29,00:28:32,There's a lot of time to spend laughing.
00:28:32,00:28:33,Yeah.
00:28:33,00:28:36,I spent 4040 minutes that day laughing at the name Titz.
00:28:36,00:28:38,Exactly.
00:28:38,00:28:42,James brought the average for the whole year.
00:28:42,00:28:45,Has anyone seen the jokes written by computers?
00:28:45,00:28:46,No.
00:28:46,00:28:48,So there's a website.
00:28:48,00:28:50,I don't know what the site's called.
00:28:50,00:28:55,"Jokingcomputer, I think, but it's a-b-d-n-dot-ac.uk/jokingcomputer."
00:28:55,00:28:57,"And the computer comes up with jokes,"
00:28:57,00:29:00,which are terrible puns that don't really work.
00:29:00,00:29:04,How is a tender food different from an additional support?
00:29:04,00:29:06,One is a sore meat.
00:29:06,00:29:08,The other is a more seat.
00:29:08,00:29:11,It does work as a joke.
00:29:11,00:29:12,Kind of does.
00:29:12,00:29:16,"Well, you would never say this is too sore this meat."
00:29:16,00:29:17,That's true.
00:29:17,00:29:20,I wouldn't say I'm in a restaurant.
00:29:20,00:29:23,You'd probably get kicked out.
00:29:23,00:29:25,This is one that I don't really understand.
00:29:25,00:29:29,What do you call an aquatics with a saint's John?
00:29:29,00:29:31,A sweet mane.
00:29:31,00:29:32,Okay.
00:29:32,00:29:36,So there's a button where you can press why is this a joke?
00:29:36,00:29:40,And it says swimming is a kind of aquatics.
00:29:40,00:29:42,Do you agree or disagree?
00:29:42,00:29:43,And I agree with that.
00:29:43,00:29:44,Okay.
00:29:44,00:29:48,"And it says, ""Main"" sounds like the end of swimming."
00:29:48,00:29:49,Almost.
00:29:49,00:29:50,I put disagree with that.
00:29:50,00:29:54,And then a saint's John can be a part of a mane.
00:29:54,00:29:56,I really don't understand that at all.
00:29:56,00:29:58,Is it a town in the state of Maine?
00:29:58,00:29:59,"Oh, that's possible."
00:29:59,00:30:00,Yeah.
00:30:00,00:30:02,"Anyway, it didn't really work for me."
00:30:02,00:30:03,That's where it falls down.
00:30:03,00:30:06,Someone needs to explain to that computer that if you tell a joke
00:30:06,00:30:08,"and then you immediately need to explain it,"
00:30:08,00:30:09,it's not a good joke.
00:30:09,00:30:11,It needs to remove that button immediately.
00:30:11,00:30:12,That's true.
00:30:12,00:30:15,Although I think by me disagreeing with those things
00:30:15,00:30:17,it helps it to make jokes in the future.
00:30:17,00:30:19,"Oh, that's so good of you."
00:30:19,00:30:20,You've done it a lot of it.
00:30:20,00:30:22,"Well, I like to do my bit."
00:30:22,00:30:25,"I was looking into, there's a famous joke that St Gregory made"
00:30:25,00:30:29,"where he saw, he was in Rome and he saw some angle boys"
00:30:29,00:30:31,as in angles and Anglo-Saxons.
00:30:31,00:30:32,Okay.
00:30:32,00:30:35,"And he said non-angly said angely, not angles, but angels."
00:30:35,00:30:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:36,00:30:39,Because they were so fair-head and so pretty looking and all of this.
00:30:39,00:30:41,"And supposedly he said, ""Well, let's go and convert England"
00:30:41,00:30:45,"or let's go and convert England to Catholic Roman Christianity."""
00:30:45,00:30:49,So this got me on to reading about things that were sins
00:30:49,00:30:51,in the 8th to 11th centuries.
00:30:51,00:30:54,And there were big sins that you could commit.
00:30:54,00:30:57,It was a sin in the 8th century to see your wife naked.
00:30:57,00:30:58,Really?
00:30:58,00:30:59,Yep.
00:30:59,00:31:01,There was an archbishop of Canterbury called Theodore
00:31:01,00:31:04,"and he had a penitential, which is basically a huge list of sins"
00:31:04,00:31:05,and punishments for sins.
00:31:05,00:31:07,"So lots of them are sex related, so sex would be behind,"
00:31:07,00:31:10,"not allowed, or all sex really bad, the worst of all sins."
00:31:10,00:31:11,It's all sex.
00:31:11,00:31:17,"But, right, if you have sex with a nun, you have to go on a fast for four years."
00:31:17,00:31:23,"If your wife cheats on you and you divorce her and you remarry,"
00:31:23,00:31:27,you then have to do a hard penance of seven years for remarrying somebody else.
00:31:27,00:31:31,"But even if you forgive your wife, you either have to not have sex with her"
00:31:31,00:31:35,"until her penance is over, or you have to do penance for two years"
00:31:35,00:31:38,because you're having sex with someone who's an adulteress.
00:31:38,00:31:41,"Do you think, so whenever someone's wife or husband cheated on them,"
00:31:41,00:31:45,did they have to open up this vast law book and work out exactly the course they'd take
00:31:45,00:31:47,to avoid being arrested?
00:31:47,00:31:48,Wait a minute.
00:31:48,00:31:51,"So, when you cheast on me, did you do it from behind?"
00:31:51,00:31:54,Because that's subsection 8b.
00:31:54,00:31:58,"As she's speaking of the angles, they had some good jokes."
00:31:58,00:32:02,"The oldest Anglo-Saxon joke, I think, might be the best old joke I've come across."
00:32:02,00:32:03,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:03,00:32:04,Okay.
00:32:04,00:32:05,"You're building it up a bit there, Anna."
00:32:05,00:32:07,"That's a real error, isn't it?"
00:32:07,00:32:08,Yeah.
