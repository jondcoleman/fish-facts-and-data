WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 We're going to go to the next room to take a look at what we're going to do.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.960
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.640
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.640
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.440
 I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.040
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.760
 last seven days and in a particular order, here we go, starting with you, James.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.680
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1921, the news of the world offered a free tea tray

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.680
 to any mother on the birth of her 10th child.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.680
 Why was it doing that?

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.720
 Well, the reason was it had just been the war and also there was contraception, widespreadly

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.800
 available now, which there wasn't before, and the newspapers had a bit of a kind of moral

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.120
 crisis about the being not enough children in the UK and so they wanted to encourage children.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.840
 The daily express, for instance, had a Britain's largest family competition at the same time.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.640
 But the idea of the news of the world was that a woman would genuinely be induced to think,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.160
 "Actually, I won't stop at three.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.440
 I'll go all the way up to 10 children because once I get to 10, I'll get a tea tray."

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.440
 It's interesting, isn't it?

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.440
 What stage?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.760
 After how many children do you go?

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.280
 I might as well carry on for the tea tray now.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.280
 I have a theory that the unless tea trays have massively depreciated in value, the cost

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.280
 of rearing a child would not be offset by the value of the tea tray.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.120
 I think that's pretty solid theory, actually.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.120
 Do you think that's solid economics?

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.360
 Well, how often they made, I wonder how many tea trays they had to give away.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.920
 Do you think they just no one actually went for it because in the end, it's only a tea

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.920
 tray and when the news of the world shut down, what they had to clear out of their offices

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 were 50,000 tea trays.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.000
 That's a good point though, when did that deal expire?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.840
 If they're running the competition for a year, say it, only applies to people who realistically

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.160
 got nine children and can get pregnant within the next three months.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.680
 Maybe it was running all the way until the news of the world closed last year or the year

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.680
 before.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.680
 Maybe that's what sent them down.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.160
 Some have finally claimed the tea tray.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.520
 No, it was massive phone hacking.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.520
 Yeah, let's be clear.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.640
 We should, for overseas listeners, news of the world was a massive newspaper here.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.520
 It came out every Sunday and they got caught for a big hacking scandal of people's mobile

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.280
 phones and so Rupert Muradalk had to shut it down.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.800
 There was so much pressure.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.240
 I was looking into things that had been given away for free.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.960
 Here's one free thing that was given away that I'm very annoyed to learn because I've found

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.320
 out it's no longer going.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.480
 But Etti had had a promotion whereby if it rained while you were in Abu Dhabi, you would

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.720
 get a free trip off the back of it.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.360
 It had a guarantee sunshine or your next holiday free.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.080
 You're going to Abu Dhabi soon, aren't you?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.560
 Yeah, I'm going in about two weeks.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.440
 Well, maybe if you say Etti had enough time, you said, "Well, you get a free trip, I do love

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.440
 Etti had."

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.440
 So, who was the company?

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.440
 Etti had.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.440
 Right.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.440
 What do they do?

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.440
 They're an airline.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.440
 They're an airline.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.440
 They're the best out there.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.440
 Actually, they've been voted number one airline.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.440
 Actually, I think they're awful.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.960
 Good luck getting that free trip down.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.920
 Have you guys had a newspaper insurance?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920
 No.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.200
 If you subscribed and you got a medical condition, the newspaper would pay you some money and

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.000
 they would print massive columns full of people who had won money or been given money.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.920
 So, in 1922, if you've got appendicitis and you're subscribed to the Express, you get

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.640
 a tenor, which is quite a lot of money.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.640
 Wow.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.640
 Yeah.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.640
 When?

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.640
 How long ago?

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.640
 This is the 20s.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.640
 And a tenor of today's money or...

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.640
 No.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.640
 Back then.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.640
 No, no, no.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.640
 How much today's money was?

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.840
 Same travel to the future, they were so rich in those days.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840
 Amazing.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.200
 Actually, one of the earliest newspapers was called "Ikabod Dorks Newsletter."

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.200
 I think this...

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.200
 Your works?

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.200
 That's one of these things I wrote down, but completely fine.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.120
 It's DAWK, so there's nothing funny about that at all, actually.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.920
 You can't get many "Ikabods" these days.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.160
 I think it's a very nice name.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.560
 I think so as well.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.120
 If you're about to have your tenor child, why not call it "Ikabod"?

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.120
 People send you a free no such thing as a fish mug.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.120
 We'll genuinely do it.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.120
 We can promise that, right?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.120
 Yeah, we can promise that.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.120
 Okay.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.120
 We need evidence.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.120
 We need a birth certificate.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.120
 Yeah.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.120
 The price of rearing the baby.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.120
 Do you think that's going to be offset by the price of a no such thing as a fish mug?

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.120
 They are extremely valuable.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.120
 There's always one of them in the world at the moment.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.120
 There's one in the world, yeah.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.120
 I should finish this off.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.480
 So Mr. Dorks Newsletter was one of the first newspapers, and it came with a blank space

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.200
 in every edition so that you could buy it, and then the blank space was for you to write

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.200
 your own personal news, because then you'd send it to your friends and relatives.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.200
 That's a really good idea.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.200
 Yeah, it's such a good idea.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.200
 Because people would share newspapers.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.200
 It used to be that one newspaper, people estimate it would be read by about 20 to 30 people.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.200
 Yeah.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.200
 Yeah.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.200
 Because often it was read out loud as well, isn't it?

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.200
 I missed those days, because I didn't actually live in the 19th century, but I would, if I had,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.200
 miss those days when there would be a literate person, and then people who couldn't read

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.200
 as well, or people who just wanted to hear the newspaper read out.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.200
 And they all crowd around and clamor to have the news read out in the 19th century, and then

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.200
 someone would read it out.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.200
 Wouldn't that be great?

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.200
 I can't imagine sitting down in the 19th century with your grandfather on his chair, and he opens

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.200
 up the newspaper, says, "Gather round everyone, gather round."

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.200
 It's how he's star in three-in-a-bed rom.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.200
 Yeah, true.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.200
 This is the thing about the news of the world, is that it was a crime newspaper for the first

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.200
 few decades.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.200
 Yeah.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.200
 Are they specialised in gruesome murders, and also in Vickers court in impropriety and things

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.200
 like that?

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.200
 Yeah, the news of the world was always trashy and scandalous.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.200
 It wasn't because I thought maybe you'd read back into its history, and you'd find out that

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.200
 it used to be a well-respected paper, but it was always, yeah, really gossipy and full of

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.200
 lured things and murders.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.200
 And at the very start of the 20th century, the editor of the Palma Gazette, I think, a more

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:58.200
 paper who was called Frederick Greenwood, went up to the editor of the news of the world and said,

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.200
 "He'd looked at the paper once, and then he'd immediately put it in his waste paper basket."

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.200
 And then he thought, "If I leave it there, the cook may read it, so I burned it."

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.200
 There was a bloke who a couple years ago found a first edition of the news of the world,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.200
 which was in 1843.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.200
 He was called William March, age 72, and he found it in his attic.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.200
 He said, "I was just clearing stuff out, and I just found it there.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.200
 I was going to dump it, but then I saw the date.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.200
 It cost just three pence, and it's just eight pages.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.200
 I have looked through it, and it is a bit boring."

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:37.200
 They used to be newspapers or magazines, which were exclusively for Lonely Hearts Adverts,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.200
 all the way through the 19th century.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.200
 So the first one was called Matrimonial News, and then it was followed in rapid succession by

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.200
 the marriage gazette, matrimonial times, matrimonial record, matrimonial herald,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.200
 aristocratic matrimonial, marriage envoy, marriage advertiser,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.200
 matrimonial chronicle, matrimonial world, matrimonial courier,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.200
 honeymoon, matrimonial intelligence here, and matrimonial register.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.200
 Ironically, all bought by people who weren't married.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.200
 Exactly!

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.200
 What a misnomer!

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.200
 Why aren't there some desperate singleton gazettes?

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.200
 Okay, time for fact number two, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:25.200
 My fact is that Belgian fishermen go fishing on horseback, and they drown in their thousands.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.200
 Do they?

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.200
 No, they don't.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.200
 They fish just on the coast, and they're fishing for shrimp.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.200
 Okay, so they're not on like big boats on horseback.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.200
 I'll be honest, I thought in the river rather than on the coast,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.200
 I'm even surprised that it's on the coast.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, and they have really, really strong horses,

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.200
 because the horses are up to the top of their legs and more so,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.200
 and obviously that's quite hard to wade through that,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.200
 especially if you're a horse, and you've got more legs.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.200
 And then once you're dealing with the vast weight of shrimps on top of that?

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.200
 And so they pull a net behind them, and they also pull a chain in front of the net,

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.200
 and the chain stirs up the shrimps, and it frightens them a bit,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.200
 and it means they flee into the net.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.200
 And then you have, yeah.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.200
 And not many people do this anymore, unfortunately,

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.200
 i.e. 12 households do it still,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.200
 because it's not very profitable anymore.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.200
 And are they using rods or spears?

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.200
 No, they're using neither.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.200
 Why would it be rods or spears?

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.200
 Oh, I thought they would be looking at the fish, swimming past them,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200
 and they would...

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.200
 Or they would sit there with a rod, just fishing.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.200
 Have you ever tried to spear a shrimp?

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.200
 You've got a really good aim.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.200
 That's true, yeah.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.200
 You know, all skewed kebabs.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.200
 That's how they make them, yeah.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.200
 It's really annoying, because you have to wait for them to line up

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.200
 in just the right order, and then to spear them.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.200
 So some of the ways of catching fish?

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.200
 Yeah.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.200
 And there's some good ones in America.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.200
 They had a thing called telephoning.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.200
 What you would do is you would take a telephone off the wall.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.200
 They had like a magnetic coil in there,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.200
 and you would kind of ramp that up, and so it got electric.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.200
 And then you would put the wires in the water,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.200
 stun all of the fish, and then just grab them.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.200
 And then what people would do was then get the phone,

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.200
 put it back on the wall, and ring their friends up to say,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200
 "Guess what I've done today."

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.200
 No.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.200
 Another one is called catfisting.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.200
 What?

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.200
 No.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.200
 Yeah, catfisting, and that is exactly what it sounds like.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.200
 I don't think you can be exactly what it is.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.200
 You put your fist into the water, and the catfish kind of grabs onto it,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.200
 and then you pull your fist out, and the catfish is on your hand,

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.200
 so you're using your fist as bait.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.200
 I had the opposite in my head, in that you fist a cat.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.200
 You put that under the water, and the cat catches a fish.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.200
 So I was really close.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.200
 You were so close, Dad, yeah.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200
 But cats love fish.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.200
 Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.200
 So they're kind of jointly hating it, and loving it at the same time.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.200
 It's a roller coaster of emotions.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200
 That's also noodling, isn't it?

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.200
 And I think that's really dangerous, because it often involves diving

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.200
 to quite low depths, because the catfish live in holes,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.200
 and you dive to low depths, and I think people drown or they get.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.200
 I think it's got a high injury rate.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.200
 Well, it's a good thing that cats have nine lives, in that case.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.200
 You can catch eight catfish.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.200
 I have a couple of things on Belgium, and I really like this.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.200
 Now, I think, like how you're saying, there's only about 12 families left

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.200
 that do this kind of thing.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.200
 I don't know if this is a national sport, but it's certainly been documented.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.200
 It's called "Shit Yourself Rich."

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.200
 And it's a really cool idea.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.200
 The sport involves, you divide a field up into an imaginary grid,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.200
 and everyone starts having a bet where the cow in that field will have a poo,

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.200
 and whoever gets it right then gets the money.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.200
 So it's basically a lot of Belgians watching a cow in a field waiting for it to poo,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.200
 with money riding on the spot that it's going to go in.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.200
 I have a feeling that might have happened in Britain as well.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.200
 I've heard about it a few times, yeah.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.200
 And it's just basically a lottery kind of thing, isn't it?

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200
 Yeah.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.200
 Also, I've read that Belgium is the largest exporter of billiard balls.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.200
 It's quite cool.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.200
 80% of the world's billiard balls are made in Belgium.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.200
 Really?

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.200
 Wow!

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.200
 Really odd.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.200
 It reminds me of that fact that most of the world's false teeth come from Lichtenstein.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200
 Really?

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:03.200
 I was reading an adventure book for boys that was written in 1890,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.200
 and it recommends goose fishing.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.200
 Oh, I think you mean goose fishing, isn't it?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.200
 Yeah, so you use goose fishermen, they're called,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.200
 and it recommends that you just tie a fishing line and hook to a goose's leg,

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.200
 and then you drive the goose into the water, and that works as a fisherman.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.200
 And it just swims along, and it's got bait on the end.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.200
 And as soon as the goose feels a fish pulling on his leg,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.200
 it gets a bit distressed because the fish is trying to pull it underwater,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.200
 and it swims back to the shore, and it brings the fish with it,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.200
 and then you unhook it, and there you go.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.200
 You haven't had to do anything.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200
 Wow.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.200
 That's pretty ingenious.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.200
 Do you know, it's really hard for us to tell how fast fish swim.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.200
 What?

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.200
 Well, it's really, how do you know what the fastest fish is?

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.200
 How can you measure speed of fish?

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.200
 I guess it's hard to see them under the water,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.200
 and then you'd have to be going at the same speed as them,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.200
 otherwise they're just, you know, two miles away,

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.200
 and you're still sitting your boat, you don't know where they are.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.200
 Yeah.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.200
 So what they do do is this is a thing that's been set up

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.200
 amongst professional fishermen is that when they've caught something,

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.200
 they start measuring how fast the reel goes out,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.200
 so the speed of the reel, and then they log that time.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.200
 So they found, so far, in any of these experiments,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.200
 that the fastest fish is the sailfish,

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.200
 and it took out a 300 feet of line, a fishing line, in three seconds.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.200
 So it went from zero to 60 in 2.6 seconds.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.200
 That is incredible.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.200
 Although I guess these fish, they've just been caught, haven't they?

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.200
 And they're trying to escape, so it's not like a normal fish would go that fast, maybe.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.200
 Yeah, so maybe we could improve human 100 meter times by...

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.200
 The guy shooting the gun to start, start pointing it out.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.200
 That's the way to do it.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.200
 But yeah, that's interesting.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.200
 I had no idea.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.200
 I assumed that we just knew what the fastest fish was.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.200
 Yeah, I would assume we'd tag them.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.200
 Well, they are swimming faster fish in response to human fishing.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.200
 So... Yeah, sensible.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.200
 Well, the fish... If you are chasing a fish with a net,

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.200
 which sometimes happens, you've got a, you know,

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.200
 trying to out swim a net, basically.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.200
 The slower fish will be caught, and then the faster fish will survive,

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.200
 and then they're more likely to breed.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.200
 So we might actually change fish physiology just by fishing for them.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.200
 Might they get stronger because the stronger ones manage to wriggle out of the nets,

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.200
 and the weaker ones get caught, and then eventually you've got massively fast,

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.200
 super strong fish.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.200
 Eventually the fish will be catching us.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.200
 No, they'll be fishing for humans.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.200
 We'll just see these rods coming out of the water, onto the land, dragging us in.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.200
 The dystopia I see before me.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.200
 You see a cat?

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.200
 Just the adorable cat, and you go over to pet it,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.200
 and then you see it's got a fin poking out at the end of it.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:49.200
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:55.200
 My fact this week is that 68% of mountains don't have pointy peaks.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.200
 So what does that mean?

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.200
 Does it mean like, like, table mountain, it has a flat top?

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.200
 Yeah, yeah, so I guess any time you draw a mountain,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.200
 if we were drawing a mountain, we would give it a pointy peak, right?

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.200
 And so this is why this fact really surprised me.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.200
 I just assumed that it's going to have a pointy peak.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.200
 Some guys at Princeton University, Paul Elson and Morgan Tingley,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.200
 decided that they wanted to do a survey and see how many mountains do, in fact, have pointy peaks.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.200
 So they did a, they took satellite data from 182 mountain ranges around the world,

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.200
 and they looked at it, and they discovered that 68% of these mountains didn't have a pointy peak.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.200
 So that's a sort of...

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.200
 So I think the definition of pointy peak is important here,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.200
 because I wasn't that surprised at first, because I thought, well, no mountain peaks.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.200
 Because every time you climb a mountain, you're not kind of balancing the little kind of pointy.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.200
 I always pierce my foot and top step.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.200
 So it's actually more interesting, even than it sounds, I think,

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:56.200
 because the guys who did the study define pointy peak or define a pyramid-shaped mountain,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.200
 as just a mountain whose area steadily decreases as it goes up, right?

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.200
 So as a mountain whose sides just steadily move towards each other,

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:08.200
 so it doesn't mean that the peak has to be as sharp as a needle.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.200
 So it could be a ziggurat's wrap and the pyramid?

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.200
 Exactly, it could be a ziggurat.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.200
 It's like a pyramid with a flat top.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.200
 Yeah, okay.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.200
 Yeah, so you could have a flat top, exactly.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:24.200
 And what they found is, I think, that actually mountains often have an hourglass shape,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.200
 so their area would start off big, and then it would get smaller as it went up,

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:33.200
 but then it would increase again, and then sometimes they'd be inverted pyramids,

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.200
 where I think...

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.200
 Is that incredible?

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.200
 This is amazing.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.200
 That is rubbish.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.200
 Well, that's much less cool than it sounds though, right?

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.200
 Because it's not like an upside-down pyramid.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.200
 It's not like it's an excited point on the ground.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.200
 Yeah, and where it gets way outward.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:52.200
 It's where it gets less and less steep, so it doesn't consistently go up like pyramids.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.200
 Oh, that's interesting.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.200
 Yeah.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.200
 Okay.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.200
 But yeah, and there are...

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.200
 So they found those inverse ones that you're talking about,

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.200
 which is 6% in the survey, were these type.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.200
 So that's where the land area increases to the top.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:12.200
 23% had this hourglass shape, and then 39% had a diamond form, which is really cool.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.200
 So that's less land area at the top and the bottom, so more in the middle.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.200
 But where are these mountains that are shaped like diamonds?

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.200
 They start at a point on the ground, then they spread out to this massive thing in the middle,

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.200
 then they shape...

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.200
 They don't have much publicity because no one can climb them.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.200
 So one of the things about this study, or one of the things that makes it relevant

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:37.200
 and not incredibly dubious, they're all mounted to diamond plates.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.200
 But the interesting thing is that as climate change happens,

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.200
 as the planet gets warmer, animals which live in a particular band on a mountain

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.200
 are going to be pushed upwards because they're going to be pushed

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.200
 and where there's the same temperature.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.200
 So some species will benefit where they actually have more surface area higher up,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:58.200
 but some of them will, a lot more of them, I think, will suffer as a result

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.200
 because you get much smaller habitat for the species to live on.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.200
 They have to hope that they evolve wings and are able to take off from the top,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.200
 won't they? Is that pushed higher and higher up?

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.200
 They'll be a period where they're just waiting for that to happen.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.200
 I imagine.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.200
 That's exactly how you fully should work.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.200
 Yes.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.200
 Where are they going to go when they've grown these wings?

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.200
 They'll just live up in the air.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.200
 I see.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.200
 I've got birds to live in a cloud.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.200
 If you'd like to subscribe to Anna's Extreme Optimism magazine,

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.200
 have you guys been to the top of mountains?

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.200
 Some of them.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:31.200
 I just want to do a quick survey of how many of you have done.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.200
 I just want to do a tiny survey.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.200
 I've only been up one mountain.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.200
 I've been up to Ben Nevis.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.200
 Okay, so Ben Nevis is the top light.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.200
 It's a scree-like.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.200
 What was that mean?

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.200
 The same as Garpa Mike.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.200
 Loose rocks.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.200
 Loose rocks.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.200
 And then there's kind of a table thing that you stand on,

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.200
 so people can take your photo so that it's like, yeah, I got to the top.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.200
 And you're at the top of the top.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.200
 Yeah.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.200
 The only mountain I've been on, which is Mount Cosiosco in Australia.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.200
 Do you mean Cosicosco?

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.200
 That's an interesting misconception of how that is said.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.200
 It's actually Mount Cosiosco.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.200
 Please write in to tell me how correct I got that.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.200
 They have that as well.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.200
 They have a little platform that you stand on top of.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.200
 Have they artificially added to the height of the mountain?

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.200
 Yes.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.200
 In a way, yes.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.200
 Definitely.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.200
 Just on mountains.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.200
 Yeah.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.200
 I assume that we had climbed pretty much every mountain, partly because of the song.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.200
 Yeah.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.200
 She was telling people to climb every mountain.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:33.200
 Well, the message has not got across because the chairman of the Mount Everest Foundation Committee,

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:39.200
 Lindsey Griffin, said a few years ago, there are far more unclimbed peaks than climbed ones.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.200
 So many more.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.200
 Highest pint in Bhutan, you're not allowed to climb up.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.200
 Really?

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:48.200
 Also, there was a thing about Kantchenchunga, which was when people go up there,

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.200
 you're supposed to, there's like a local tradition when you're not supposed to stand on the absolute summit.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.200
 So you're supposed to stop like two steps before or something.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.200
 And the first people who did it definitely did that.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.200
 And I wonder if everyone who's gone up has kind of stopped just before,

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.200
 and whether it's never been climbed.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.200
 It probably has, really.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:11.200
 The far highest mountains on Earth, Everest, K2, Kantchenchunga and Lotsi were first scaled in 1953,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.200
 1954, 1955, and 1956, respectively.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.200
 Wow.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.200
 Why did we keep that up?

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.200
 Yeah.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.200
 Damn it.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.200
 We could have counted down all the way to the lowest mountain in the world.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.200
 That would have been amazing.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.200
 And this suspense would gradually decline and decline and decline.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.200
 Eventually you're just climbing a little hill.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.200
 Yeah.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.200
 2,550.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.200
 Yeah.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:37.200
 This is the thing that would take so long because there are so many thousands of peaks.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.200
 Yeah.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.200
 I'm surprised that Chimborazu is not seen to be.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.200
 Okay.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.200
 So Mount Chimborazu, there's an Ecuador, is the highest point on Earth.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.200
 It's 2.4 kilometers higher than Mount Everest because of the shape of the Earth.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.200
 Further from the center of the Earth.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.200
 Exactly.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.200
 Because Earth bulges a bit around the equator.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.200
 Exactly.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:04.200
 So it is by a long mile, well, 2.4 miles, that would be a long mile.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.200
 That is the highest spot on Earth.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.200
 And I'm surprised that that's not seen as more of a, because there must be with altitude and with the thinness of air.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.200
 That must be more of a challenge to get to the top.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.200
 In the 19th century they did think it was the highest for ages they did.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:22.200
 And it was when like Nepal was kind of Westerners couldn't really go there.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.200
 And so everyone thought that Chimborazu was the highest.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.200
 For quite a long time.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.200
 Wow.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.200
 That's really interesting.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.200
 Yeah.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.200
 So it had its day in the sun down.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.200
 Yeah.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.200
 Don't feel bad for it.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.200
 I've discovered a really interesting lady as a result of looking into this stuff about mountains.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.200
 Her name is Elizabeth Hawley.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.200
 She's in her 90s.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.200
 She has lived for over 50 years in the Himalayas.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:49.200
 And she has become the ultimate person for verifying summits that have been made by explorers.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.200
 She put together the Himalayan database.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.200
 And she's someone who's cracked down on whether or not people are lying about getting to the top.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.200
 Because she has an in with all the Sherpas who tell her the truth about what's going on.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.200
 Yeah. So she's sussed out a lot of fraud.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.200
 And she verified the first ever blind ascent to Everest.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.200
 And she's been living there 60 years.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:14.200
 And she every explorer, if they want to take it seriously, apparently track her down and tell her about their plans

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.200
 so that it can be verified in this database that she's been keeping for 60 years.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:22.200
 I wonder if she has a guy called Morris Wilson on her list.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:28.200
 He was a guy in the 1930s who thought that mysticism and prayer would help him to climb Everest.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.200
 That didn't work.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.200
 And so what he decided to do was to fly a plane and crash it just below the top of Everest

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.200
 and then walk up the last few feet.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.200
 How far did he get with that?

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.200
 Well, the first time he got as far as Bradford.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.200
 [laughter]

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.200
 Well, he crashed into a field.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.200
 And so then the air ministry banned him from flying.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.200
 But he just did it anyway.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.200
 And he managed to get as far as Tarjeeling.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:56.200
 And actually, he did fly his plane to Everest and he did crash it.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.200
 It seems like he died before, well, he definitely died.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.200
 When was this?

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.200
 1930s.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.200
 Did he ever get out plan for getting out of the plane before it crashed into the mountain?

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.200
 I think so.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.200
 I think he would kind of just jump out with a parachute or something.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.200
 But then kind of thought, well, I'll just walk up to the top then, that'll be fine.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.200
 And then the way down, I mean, how hard can it be to go down?

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:22.200
 Where is the largest mountain so far as we know in the universe or the solar system, let's say?

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.200
 Mars.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.200
 It was.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.200
 It's been taken over now.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.200
 Olympic mons in Mars.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.200
 Olympic.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.200
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.200
 It's been taken over.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.200
 So it's now a rear-sylvia on an asteroid called four-vester.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.200
 And it's about half the size of the moon.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.200
 So it's traveling, hurtling through the universe, the tallest mountain.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.200
 Wow.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.200
 Yeah.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.200
 It's now awesome.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.200
 That's very cool.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.200
 I hope it doesn't impale us on its sharp point.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.200
 Do we know what kind of shape it is?

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.200
 I mean, the odds are actually 68% that it doesn't have a sharp point.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:23:00.200
 It's probably a diamond or an oblate's ferroid or a rhombus mountain.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.200
 OK, it is time for a final fact of the show.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.200
 And that is Anna.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:12.200
 My fact is that the oldest your mum joke appears on a 3500-year-old Babylonian tablet.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.200
 And it's an absolute cracker.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:20.200
 Is it your mum's so old she appears on a 3500-year-old Babylonian tablet?

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.200
 So what is the joke itself?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.200
 Well, there's a minor problem in that we don't have the first half of it.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.200
 Does it not begin with your mum?

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.200
 It doesn't.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.200
 Your mum features actually a little bit later.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.200
 As a punchline.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.200
 Yeah, so we have a missing part.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.200
 And then we have the words of your mother is by the one who has sex with her.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.200
 Who is it?

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200
 Wow.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:48.200
 It sounds like a mixture between the first ever your mum a joke and the first ever knock-knock joke.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.200
 And then you have your mother is by the one that has sex with her.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.200
 Who?

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:57.200
 So are they known to be full of jokes, Kuneiform tablets?

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.200
 Hilarious, yeah, everything in Kuneiform was a joke.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.200
 No, but there is this tablet that was found in the 70s, I think,

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.200
 but has only recently been analysed, which is full of these riddles and these jokes,

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.200
 which are quite difficult.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.200
 If anyone can understand the humour in them, then write in.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:17.200
 The other one reads, the defloured girl did not become pregnant, the undefloured girl became pregnant.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.200
 What is it?

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:23.200
 And the answer is auxiliary forces.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.200
 See, that kills.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.200
 I should open with that one.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.200
 I'm obviously missing something here.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.200
 That's too high-brow for me, clearly.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.200
 Do you know there's your mum joking the Bible?

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.200
 It's a book of kings.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.200
 And I'll read it out.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.200
 When Joram saw Jehu, he said,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.200
 "Is it peace, Jehu?"

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.200
 And he answered,

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.200
 "What peace, so long as the harlot trees of your mother, Jezebel and her witchcraft are so many."

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.200
 Whoa!

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.200
 That is a good one.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.200
 Yeah.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.200
 And then from this side of the table.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.200
 We're more into our Babylonian your mum's jokes.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.200
 It's not really your mum's joke, it's your mum insult, I suppose.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.200
 It's a fine line, isn't it?

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.200
 There's an ancient Egyptian joke, so I'm going to test this material on you guys now.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.200
 How do you entertain a bored Pharaoh?

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.200
 I don't know.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.200
 How do you entertain a bored Pharaoh?

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.200
 Is it with a pyramid of um, for a russia?

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.200
 Yes, but it's a pyramid that's shaped like a parallelogram.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.200
 Like most mountains in the world, as we know.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.200
 No, it's, you sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the Nile

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.200
 and urge the Pharaoh to go catch a fish.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.200
 Oh, that's the way I tell him.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.200
 How do we know about that joke?

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.200
 Was that just an extremely long, horrific thing that we've worked it out from?

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.200
 No, it's writing, wasn't in hieroglyphics, it was in what?

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.200
 I had this question.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.200
 I had this question.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.200
 Oh, yeah, of course, sorry.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.200
 Yeah.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.200
 Sorry, ancient Egyptians.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.200
 Okay, one more ancient Egyptian joke.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.200
 One more ancient Egyptian joke.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.200
 Man is even more eager to copulate than a donkey.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.200
 His purse is what restrains him.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.200
 Oh, it's a prostitution joke.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.200
 Yeah, no.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.200
 Okay, I'm not, I'm dying, yeah.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.200
 Shakespeare has a young mum joke as well.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.200
 Does he?

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.200
 Yeah, yeah, it's in Titus Andronicus, which is not a very funny play.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.200
 It's pretty serious and people get eaten in pies and things like that.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.200
 It's incredibly gory.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.200
 It's one of the early tragedies.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.200
 And I think there's a body count of about 11 by the end.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.200
 It's so unpleasant.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.200
 But there's a bit where someone says, "I have undone your mother."

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.200
 And then the other person says, "Villain, I have done thy mother."

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.200
 And that is a proper your mum joke.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.200
 That is.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.200
 Yeah, that's straight down the line.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.200
 Someone also said that he has the first knock-knock joke,

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.200
 which is a native of Beth.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.200
 Yeah, but it's very hard to see the joke in it.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200
 So I'm skeptical.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.200
 Does it have the word knock?

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.200
 It has the word knock in it.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.200
 That's pretty much.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.200
 It has the word knock-knock.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.200
 It has it over and over again as a scene with the porter.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.200
 Yes.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.200
 It's the comic relief in the middle of the play.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.200
 So it's more like the comedy comes just from the words knock-knock-knock,

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.200
 doesn't it?

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.200
 The joke hadn't really developed further than that.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.200
 So he hadn't got to who's there.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.200
 Who's there?

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.200
 Who reached that?

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.200
 You know, everything starts somewhere, doesn't it?

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.200
 Yeah, sure.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.200
 I was going through a long time ago on "Museum Accuriosity,"

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.200
 the radio show we make.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.200
 Jimmy Carr came on and he gave us his donation to the museum

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.200
 was a book that contained all the jokes in the world.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.200
 So we did a lot of research on jokes.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.200
 Well, James did.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.200
 And I went through the scripts.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.200
 And I've stolen all his research.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.200
 So I'd like to read you out some of the best bits of research.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.200
 I'll pretend that I've never heard it before.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.200
 Yeah, exactly.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.200
 So who's one that James found?

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.200
 So Bob Monkowski, a very famous comedian in Britain,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.200
 passed away.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.200
 He wanted to write the ultimate joke and he told us to Dennis Norden,

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.200
 another massive name in British comedy history.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:36.200
 And Norden kept checking back on him every few years to say

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.200
 how far have you got with the ultimate joke?

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.200
 And years and years down the line.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.200
 He did say, not very far.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.200
 I do have the opening line though.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.200
 I know what that is.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.200
 And the opening line for the world's ultimate joke

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.200
 was a man walks into a chemist.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.200
 That's as far as he got.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.200
 So we never know if he made it any further than that.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.200
 I can see that works because halfway through

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.200
 you think it's going to be bar and then suddenly chemist.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.200
 Yes.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.200
 It does work.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.200
 I'm already laughing.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.200
 Yeah.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.200
 On the inside.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.200
 But I am off balance enough to really laugh at something

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.200
 in the next line.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.200
 Yeah, exactly.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.200
 Here's another one.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.200
 James found.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.200
 So a German psychologist found that we laughed more

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.200
 in the 1950s than we do now.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.200
 So in the 1950s we used to laugh for 18 minutes a day.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.200
 And these days we laugh for six minutes a day.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.200
 And then James added in the notes, by the way,

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.200
 if you don't find this interesting,

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.200
 this might get a laugh.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.200
 The psychologist was called Dr. Michael Titz.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.200
 18 minutes a day.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.200
 There's a lot of time to spend laughing.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.200
 Yeah.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.200
 I spent 4040 minutes that day laughing at the name Titz.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.200
 Exactly.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.200
 James brought the average for the whole year.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.200
 Has anyone seen the jokes written by computers?

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.200
 No.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.200
 So there's a website.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.200
 I don't know what the site's called.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.200
 Jokingcomputer, I think, but it's a-b-d-n-dot-ac.uk/jokingcomputer.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.200
 And the computer comes up with jokes,

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.200
 which are terrible puns that don't really work.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.200
 How is a tender food different from an additional support?

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.200
 One is a sore meat.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.200
 The other is a more seat.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.200
 It does work as a joke.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.200
 Kind of does.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.200
 Well, you would never say this is too sore this meat.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.200
 That's true.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.200
 I wouldn't say I'm in a restaurant.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.200
 You'd probably get kicked out.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.200
 This is one that I don't really understand.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.200
 What do you call an aquatics with a saint's John?

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.200
 A sweet mane.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.200
 Okay.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.200
 So there's a button where you can press why is this a joke?

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.200
 And it says swimming is a kind of aquatics.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.200
 Do you agree or disagree?

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.200
 And I agree with that.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.200
 Okay.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.200
 And it says, "Main" sounds like the end of swimming.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.200
 Almost.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.200
 I put disagree with that.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.200
 And then a saint's John can be a part of a mane.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.200
 I really don't understand that at all.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.200
 Is it a town in the state of Maine?

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.200
 Oh, that's possible.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.200
 Yeah.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.200
 Anyway, it didn't really work for me.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.200
 That's where it falls down.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.200
 Someone needs to explain to that computer that if you tell a joke

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.200
 and then you immediately need to explain it,

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.200
 it's not a good joke.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.200
 It needs to remove that button immediately.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.200
 That's true.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.200
 Although I think by me disagreeing with those things

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.200
 it helps it to make jokes in the future.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.200
 Oh, that's so good of you.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.200
 You've done it a lot of it.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.200
 Well, I like to do my bit.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.200
 I was looking into, there's a famous joke that St Gregory made

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:29.200
 where he saw, he was in Rome and he saw some angle boys

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.200
 as in angles and Anglo-Saxons.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.200
 Okay.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.200
 And he said non-angly said angely, not angles, but angels.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.200
 Because they were so fair-head and so pretty looking and all of this.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.200
 And supposedly he said, "Well, let's go and convert England

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.200
 or let's go and convert England to Catholic Roman Christianity."

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.200
 So this got me on to reading about things that were sins

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.200
 in the 8th to 11th centuries.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.200
 And there were big sins that you could commit.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.200
 It was a sin in the 8th century to see your wife naked.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.200
 Really?

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.200
 Yep.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.200
 There was an archbishop of Canterbury called Theodore

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.200
 and he had a penitential, which is basically a huge list of sins

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.200
 and punishments for sins.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.200
 So lots of them are sex related, so sex would be behind,

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.200
 not allowed, or all sex really bad, the worst of all sins.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.200
 It's all sex.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:17.200
 But, right, if you have sex with a nun, you have to go on a fast for four years.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:23.200
 If your wife cheats on you and you divorce her and you remarry,

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.200
 you then have to do a hard penance of seven years for remarrying somebody else.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:31.200
 But even if you forgive your wife, you either have to not have sex with her

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.200
 until her penance is over, or you have to do penance for two years

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.200
 because you're having sex with someone who's an adulteress.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.200
 Do you think, so whenever someone's wife or husband cheated on them,

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.200
 did they have to open up this vast law book and work out exactly the course they'd take

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.200
 to avoid being arrested?

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.200
 Wait a minute.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.200
 So, when you cheast on me, did you do it from behind?

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.200
 Because that's subsection 8b.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.200
 As she's speaking of the angles, they had some good jokes.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.200
 The oldest Anglo-Saxon joke, I think, might be the best old joke I've come across.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.200
 Okay.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.200
 You're building it up a bit there, Anna.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.200
 That's a real error, isn't it?

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.200
 Yeah.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:12.200
 So, the oldest Anglo-Saxon joke is, what hangs the demands thigh

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.200
 and wants to poke the hole that it's often poked before?

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.200
 A penis.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.200
 A penis.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.200
 A penis.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.200
 I would've said a key.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.200
 It's a key.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.200
 Oh, nice.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.200
 That's why I keep needing to ring the emergency locksmith.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.200
 Can you grade me another one that looks exactly like this?

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:36.200
 Yes, it is a child, actually.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.200
 Okay.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.200
 That's it.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.200
 That's all of our facts.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.200
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.200
