 [sad piano music]

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.440
 [speaking in foreign language]

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.880
 [sad piano music]

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.960
 [sad piano music]

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.840
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.600
 as a Fish A Weekly Podcast.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.880
 This week coming to you from the Birmingham Mac,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.280
 my name is Dan Shriver and please welcome to the stage.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.480
 It's the three regular elves, Andy Murray,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.440
 Anichezinski and James Harkin.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.040
 [cheering]

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.240
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.840
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.040
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.320
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.040
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 2005,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.840
 there were plans to make a 50-foot tall robot Michael Jackson

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.680
 that would roam around the Nevada desert.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.680
 [laughing]

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.080
 How advanced were these plans?

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.480
 They were pretty advanced.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.880
 Michael Jackson was going to do a residency in Vegas

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880
 and they wanted to advertise it and this was their big idea,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.880
 they were going to do a massive robot.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.480
 He was going to wander around the desert,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.480
 he was going to fire lasers out of his eye.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.880
 [laughing]

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.480
 And the idea is as you were flying into Vegas Airport,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.280
 the first thing you see when you came into Vegas

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.280
 was a massive Michael Jackson.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.080
 Well, this was a couple of months after he had been acquitted

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.680
 on charges of child molestation

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.880
 and for some reason raising money was a problem

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.880
 for this project.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.880
 [laughing]

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.080
 I think then they scaled down a bit, didn't they?

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.280
 And they decided to make a Michael Jackson theme

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.880
 "Total and Casino" in Vegas,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.880
 which had a smaller robot at the door.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.880
 That's right.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.680
 And that would also fire lasers from a huge Michael Jackson face

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.880
 that was going to be painted on the huge hotel.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.880
 Yeah.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.280
 So the hotel didn't happen either?

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.880
 No, no, none of this happened.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.280
 But I mean, they always have these big plans in Vegas, don't they?

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.280
 Of what they're going to do?

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 And this one didn't quite work out.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.880
 I read one thing that they were going to do,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.280
 which was make a life size Starship Enterprise

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.880
 that was going to be in Vegas.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.280
 And that got quite far down the line

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.080
 that they were going to do this,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.080
 but they never did in the end.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.080
 Is that still trick?

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.680
 Yeah, it's cool.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.680
 Yeah.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.680
 Well, I really like the idea of turning certain celebrities

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.280
 into robots.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.880
 I think it's quite a nice idea.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.680
 No, sorry, not like the existing living ones.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.880
 Into a cyborg.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.880
 Like, for example, Philip K. Dick, they actually made a robot

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.880
 of Philip K. Dick.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.880
 And they left his head on a plane accidentally.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.880
 And it became a huge story of where's Philip K. Dick's head?

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.880
 Not the robot.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.280
 Yeah, it was a robot head.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.080
 But so, yeah, so they did it with Philip K. Dick.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.880
 I wish they did it with Michael Jackson.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.280
 What was the sort of, what was the purpose of the Philip K. Dick one?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.880
 I think it was just so that they could have the headline Dick head missing.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.080
 I think you're right.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.080
 It was obviously the connection that he has with do electronic sheep.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.080
 Yeah.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.080
 Do robots dream of electric sheep?

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.080
 Yeah, exactly.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.680
 So it was just such a founder of the idea.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.080
 So they were trying to do AI and they created a Philip K. Dick robot,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080
 but lost his head.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.080
 Yeah.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.080
 I was reading about robots and walking robots.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.080
 It's so hard to make walking robots.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.680
 So the distance record for a walking robot is 54 miles, which is amazing.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.080
 Oh, it's longer than I can walk.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.080
 Wow.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.280
 But it was a very set path.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.080
 So it was around a flat course in an indoor arena and it then ran out of battery power

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.080
 and it stopped.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.280
 And the article I read about it said unconscious and immobile.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.880
 Ching-Gee under Guinness World Record and it has a little moustache painted on the front.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.880
 But the thing is, it's not very useful because to walk on rough terrain is much,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.880
 much harder.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.880
 Almost impossible.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.880
 And it just walked around the circles.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.880
 Exactly.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.880
 And as the article says, the robot is not really designed for real world applications

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:55.280
 as there are a few jobs that require a robot to walk a smooth circular path until it collapses.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.680
 I read an exciting bit of robot news yesterday as well,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.080
 which is that there is a robot currently writing new episodes of the sitcom Friends.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.080
 How can they tell?

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.080
 It's fun.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.080
 So it's interesting.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.280
 It's a guy called Andy Hurden.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.480
 He's been feeding all the scripts of Friends into a machine

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.480
 and it's been generating what effectively is just really weird fanfiction

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.880
 of Friends, but doing full scripts and it doesn't make total sense.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.680
 They've put a few extracts online.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.680
 One is, this is from Chandler.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.480
 So Brackets, first off, Chandler.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.480
 Brackets in a muffin.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.680
 Brackets runs to the girls to cry.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.480
 And then the dialogue, "Can I get some presents?"

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.080
 So that's where that's at at the moment.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.880
 That sounds absolutely fantastic.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.080
 They're doing a reunion of Friends.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.480
 If they should take one of these scripts to build Friends.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.080
 That sounds better than actual Friends.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.880
 And I'm a huge fan of actual Friends.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.880
 That sounds incredible, doesn't it?

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.880
 I read quite a cool headline about robots.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.880
 And that is USA challenges Japan to a giant robot battle.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.880
 Wow.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.880
 That sounds cool, doesn't it?

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.080
 Where can we get tickets?

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.080
 Well, I don't really know, but there's a company called Megabot's USA

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.680
 that raised $1.8 million through Kickstarter to make a massive robot.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.680
 And apparently there's one other company in the world

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.080
 that makes massive robots in there from Japan.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.080
 And they've challenged each other to a big fight.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.480
 And it's going to happen sometime this year.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.080
 Each robot suit will be piloted by a team

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.080
 and both are laden with guns that can shoot paint-filled cannonballs.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.280
 I imagine Japan are going to absolutely smash that.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.680
 Every impressive robot,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.680
 advanced you hear about, comes from Japan, doesn't it?

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680
 Yeah, from there.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.480
 There's one which is, comes from Harvard University,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.880
 which is robot bees, which are quite cool.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.480
 So these robot bees, they can swim and fly.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.480
 Swim like a puffin, apparently, rather than, I don't know why, you wouldn't make a swim like a fish.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.480
 What do they fly like?

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.480
 They fly.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.480
 That was Muhammad Ali's rejected slogan, wasn't it?

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.480
 Swim like a puffin, fly like a cow.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.480
 They fly like a bee.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.480
 But they can be used to pollinate crops in future, they think.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.480
 For various reasons, but, yeah, autonomously pollinate crops

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.480
 that are struggling to be pollinated naturally

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.480
 for search and rescue operations, military surveillance, traffic monitoring,

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.480
 we'll have a little robot bees buzzing above our cars.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.480
 That's quite cool.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.480
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.480
 Can I bring up a couple of Michael Jackson facts?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.480
 Yeah.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.480
 So when Michael Jackson died,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.480
 I read this massive biography of him

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.480
 and they're such an interesting family.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.480
 Like when the Jackson 5 got big and then the subsequent solo career

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.480
 is Joe Jackson, the dad, started releasing his own products,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.480
 thinking I can ride this wave of celebrity.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.480
 He released a competitor to Coca-Cola.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.480
 You want to take these guys on, releasing Joe Cola.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.480
 But this is a thing that I didn't know about him,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.480
 which is the family are Jehovah Witnesses.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.480
 At least they were back in the day.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.480
 And the moment didn't want Michael Jackson and the family

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.480
 to lose their connection with the Jehovah's Witnesses

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.480
 despite being famous.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.480
 So even at the height of his fame,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.480
 when they were doing blame it on the boogie and stuff,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.480
 Michael Jackson still had to go door-to-door undercover

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.480
 as a Jehovah's Witness to tell people,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.480
 "Yeah."

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.480
 And everyone who they've interviewed about it said,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.480
 "Well, it was blatantly Michael Jackson in the door."

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.480
 Yeah, just like a fake mustache.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.480
 He was like, "Oh, Michael, can I talk to you about it?"

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.480
 And they were like, "It's Michael Jackson."

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.480
 "Yeah, of course he can."

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.480
 Wait, wasn't he five when they were doing blame it on the boogie's stuff?

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.480
 No, he was like a teenager.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.480
 No, no, he was like a teenager.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.480
 Who is it?

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.480
 Well, this is Michael Jackson,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.480
 but he's got a moustache on it.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.480
 So he used to go for hours and they would just be like,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.480
 "Of course you can talk to us about it."

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.480
 And he would sit in their house and he'd be stuck there.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.480
 And he would probably be the only Jehovah's Witness in history going,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.480
 "How am I going to get out of this house?"

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.480
 I like the message,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.480
 but maybe could you sing a few bars of it?

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.480
 Okay, so he recycled that disguise, I think,

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.480
 because so his two security guards

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.480
 who have security guards for the last few years of his life have written a book

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.480
 and they say that whenever they had to go shopping,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.480
 he wouldn't sneak out the back in disguise.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.480
 So we all might have seen Michael Jackson, but we wouldn't know.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.480
 And once, in 1989, he went shopping in disguise.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:07.480
 He was wearing a false moustache, but also a red baseball cap and a Afro wig.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.480
 And he was arrested because he looked like a shoplifter.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.480
 One of the phrases in the news article at the time,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.480
 I liked from this, just because I had never heard it before,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.480
 was one of the security guards who arrested him,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.480
 and then he started saying this guy who looked like a crazy man,

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.480
 said, "I'm Michael Jackson."

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.480
 And so the security guard said,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.480
 "My first thought was this guy had gotten off the elevator between floors."

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.480
 And I googled that phrase, and it's not a phrase.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.480
 Can I love it?

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.480
 That's amazing.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.480
 We're gonna have to move on to our second fact.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.480
 So it's time for fact number two, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.480
 My fact is that in the 16th century, people disliked hedgehogs

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.480
 because it was believed that they sucked cows udders.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.480
 This is a genuine myth, if you like, about hedgehogs.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.480
 So I looked into it. I found loads of books, 19th century, 18th century,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.480
 all saying, "And so the later ones are debunking it."

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.480
 So there's one from 1862, which says,

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.480
 "The hedgehog sucks the milk from cows is a vulgar error.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.480
 It is structurally impossible for the hedgehog to drain the udder of the cow."

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.480
 Are hedgehogs famous for standing on their back legs?

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.480
 No.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.480
 But cows lie down at night.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.480
 You're thinking of people.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.480
 You are thinking of people.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.480
 Hedgehogs are lactose intolerant, aren't they?

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.480
 Why?

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.480
 So are they?

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.480
 Are lactose intolerant?

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.480
 Yes, stop giving the milk, everyone.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.480
 Yeah.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.480
 I will lack a lot of cancer lactose intolerant,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.480
 but I think almost all hedgehogs are lactose intolerant,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.480
 so they get really sick when you're not.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.480
 My reddit is them diarrhea.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.480
 Yeah.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.480
 And then they come back and have more milk because they've had diarrhea.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.480
 Because they like that so much.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.480
 No, sorry.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.480
 They're dehydrated.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.480
 Is why they come back for more of its people think they like it.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.480
 So hedgehogs were originally called urchins.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.480
 And that's where sea urchin comes from.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.480
 Because it looks like a hedgehog of the ocean.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.480
 Yeah.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.480
 Urchins are still cool.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.480
 Sea hedgehogs and dutch.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.480
 Urchins are some Victorian cookney youths.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.480
 Yes.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.480
 Just a pack of sea hedgehogs.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.480
 I can tell you something else that people used to think about hedgehogs.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.480
 So Pliny, who's one of our favourite guys, Pliny Elder,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.480
 he wrote that hedgehogs could climb trees, knock down apples,

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.480
 and then roll on the apples, put them on their spikes,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.480
 and then run away stealing the apples.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.480
 Oh.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.480
 It's good, doesn't it?

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.480
 They can't do that.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.480
 Why, why have they not worked that out?

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.480
 That's fantastic.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.480
 They roll into balls.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480
 They roll into balls, yeah.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.480
 I mean, I think the spikes just aren't spiking enough.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.480
 No, but that was believed into the 19th century.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.480
 There were debunkings of it.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.480
 And that they can climb.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.480
 They can climb up walls.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.480
 Walls?

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.480
 Yes.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.480
 You're thinking of spiders.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.480
 I'm not.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:58.480
 I have read people saying they can climb into a first floor flat.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.480
 Into a first floor flat.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.480
 That's right.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.480
 How come tankers went with aliens?

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.480
 All right, get it together.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.480
 Yeah.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.480
 Should we talk about hedgehogs, Anna?

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.480
 Let's talk more about hedgehogs.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.480
 So, you know how they can go into a bowl?

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.480
 That was saying.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.480
 Yeah.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.480
 The muscle, which allows them to go into the bowl,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.480
 is the same muscle that you use when you're frowning.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.480
 So, you know, when your face kind of crunches up like that,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.480
 their muscle, their version of that muscle in your face

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.480
 goes all the way down their body.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.480
 And it's that that turns them into a bowl.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.480
 And they do an arse frown, don't they?

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.480
 Because they do it on the front.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.480
 The first thing they do is frown with their front.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.480
 And then those binds come over their face.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.480
 And then they do an arse frown

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.480
 with their end of their spine.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.480
 And then that makes their spine cover their bum.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.480
 And then they have a third muscle,

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.480
 which latches those two bits of bowl together.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.480
 So they can sit by that for hours and hours.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480
 Wow.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480
 It's amazing.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.480
 It must be so cozy.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.480
 Yeah.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.480
 I read another few quotes from 17th, 16th century sources

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.480
 about hedgehogs.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.480
 And one of them is from 1607.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.480
 It's a book called The History of Four-footed Beasts.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.480
 And it's about what foxes do when they find a hedgehog.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.480
 And apparently it was thought that when a fox finds a hedgehog,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.480
 it licketh gently the face and snout of the hedgehog

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.480
 by that means bringing himself to unfold himself

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.480
 and to stand upon his legs, which being done.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.480
 He poisoned at the beast with the urine that he rendered

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.480
 upon the hedgehog's face.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.480
 Oh, wait.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.480
 He's on its face.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.480
 So they thought foxes weed hedgehogs to death?

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.480
 Yeah, which they don't.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.480
 I don't think.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.480
 I heard another thing about foxes and urine and hedgehogs,

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.480
 which is that--

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.480
 Oh, yeah, I got four or five of these.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.480
 Just that foxes I read that when you had a hedgehog in a bowl,

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.480
 then fox would urinate on it to make it open itself up

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.480
 and then go for the fleshy bit inside.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.480
 And that's like--

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.480
 I think still some people in the countryside believe that.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.480
 I don't know if it's true or not, but a lot of people think it.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.480
 They also are immune to snake venom mostly,

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.480
 or not completely immune, but almost completely resistant

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.480
 to snake venom.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.480
 So they can hedgehogs have been known to kill snakes, poisonous snakes.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.480
 Wow.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.480
 They can bite back.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.480
 And they do this other--

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.480
 Sorry.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.480
 Just doing a run of hedgehog facts now.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.480
 But they cover themselves in really gross substances,

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.480
 and we don't know why.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.480
 So they roll around for night, don't they?

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.480
 Like they spit on themselves a little bit.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.480
 Yeah.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.480
 Exactly.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.480
 So when they find weird stuff like turpentine,

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.480
 which is obviously very potent, or tobacco, they'll chew it,

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.480
 and then they get a little lather worked up in their mouth,

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.480
 and they spit all over their spines.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.480
 So they cover themselves in turps or tobacco or something like that.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.480
 And we don't know why it is.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.480
 It might be to make their spines a little bit toxic.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.480
 Or it might be to kill parasites, but it might just be for fun.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.480
 I read one idea was that they were trying to camouflage themselves.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.480
 The smell would create a sort of camouflage defect.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.480
 And I just love the idea that there's no truth to that,

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.480
 and the hedgehogs don't know it.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.480
 And I just walk here and go, "He has no idea that I'm here."

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.480
 He thinks I'm a cigarette.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.480
 I hope no one smokes me.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.480
 You know, when you're playing Sonic the Hedgehog,

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.480
 if you go underwater, Sonic drowns and you lose a life,

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:18.480
 they forgot to fact check that because hedgehogs actually can swim.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.480
 So there's a lot of, I'm sorry, death.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.480
 Are you all thinking about humans again?

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.480
 Hedgehogs can swim.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.480
 For a bit.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.480
 They were actually quite regretful of the fact

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.480
 that they didn't fact check the fact that they could swim,

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.480
 because that could have led to some great underwater levels.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.480
 They should have had Sonic die by a fox urinating at this place.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.480
 Should we move on to the next one?

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.480
 Yeah, let's move on.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.480
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is Chazinski.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.480
 My fact this week is that the English philosopher Herbert Spencer

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.480
 had an angry suit specially made,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.480
 which he wore only when he was feeling irritable.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.480
 So this Herbert Spencer, just to go through who he is,

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.480
 he's basically Charles Darwin.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.480
 [ Laughter ]

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.480
 But he's also not Charles Darwin.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.480
 So he's the guy, first of all, he popularized the term evolution.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.480
 He said that in 1852, I think, in a book he wrote,

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.480
 which was seven years before Darwin wrote the origin of species.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.480
 And even in the origin of species, Darwin used it very sparingly.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.480
 He only used evolution for the first time in the sixth edition, I think,

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.480
 whereas Herbert Spencer was using it all over the shop.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.480
 And he also came up with a term survival of the fittest.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.480
 And then Darwin liked that, and so he used the term survival of the fittest

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.480
 to replace the term natural selection, which he'd come up with.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.480
 It wasn't nearly as catchy.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.480
 And Darwin called him 20 times my superior.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.480
 Totally loved him.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.480
 Wow, okay.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.480
 And he had some kind of suit.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.480
 What's this suit?

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.480
 Oh, yeah, right, the suit.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.480
 So it was a woolly garment, apparently, and it was designed

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.480
 so that there would be minimal exertion in getting dressed,

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.480
 because I guess when he's in a bad mood, he doesn't want to have to go

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.480
 to the trouble of putting proper clothes on.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.480
 And so it was basically a elaborate onesie, but it had some shoes fitted

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.480
 and a coat fitted.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.480
 And you just stepped in with your legs first, and then you got your shoulders in,

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.480
 and you zipped it up.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.480
 And you just slapped.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.480
 Ah, yeah.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.480
 And beat some people up.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.480
 And then, yeah, you had boots, trousers and coat on.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.480
 Oh, wow.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.480
 And sometimes he wore it for weeks at a time, apparently.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.480
 That's how angry a man is.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.480
 Oh, of course.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.480
 I read that he got angry when he was wearing it,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.480
 because people kept laughing at him saying, "What are you wearing?"

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.480
 And, yeah, people would stare at him in the streets.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.480
 But I had no idea that the onesie went back that far,

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.480
 because we've talked before on the podcast about maybe Churchill invented the onesie,

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.480
 because he had a special--

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.480
 It's like a boiler suit.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.480
 It was an adapted boiler suit, which he would wear in the Cabinet War Room.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.480
 So I thought that was the very first onesie.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.480
 But this is definitely the only one.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.480
 So Herbert Spence was quite a weird guy, wasn't he?

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.480
 Yeah, he was pretty weird.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.480
 He decided he should avoid all over stimulation for the sake of his health.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.480
 And so, if he thought conversation was getting a bit too excited,

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.480
 he would move to another room.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.480
 It was quite good.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.480
 And if he ever sat next to a nougatly person at dinner,

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.480
 he would move, so he wouldn't risk his digestion.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.480
 He would also, if he didn't have the liberty to move to another room,

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.480
 he always carried earplugs with him,

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.480
 so that if conversation was boring to him or getting him overexcited,

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.480
 he would just put earplugs in to block out irritating people.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.480
 I read that he put them in, if he was losing in an argument.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:30.480
 So it's basically, la, la, la, la.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.480
 He invented the la, la, la.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:39.480
 That's a thing, he also is said to have invented the prototype of the paperclip.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.480
 Yes. Really?

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.480
 So it sounds like he's invented a lot of things,

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.480
 but this whole survival of the fittest thing is really getting the headline

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.480
 on quite an extraordinary life.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.480
 One of his paperclips is in the British Library, I think, you can still see it.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:57.480
 But it was quite successful in this time, it made him £70 in profits in its first year,

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.480
 which in those days was a lot of money.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.480
 But then it kind of, you know, stopped being that popular after that.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.480
 I was looking into other interesting suits that have been invented.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.480
 Okay.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.480
 And there's a really exciting one, which is bat senses suit.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.480
 And so the idea, and it's actually for blind people,

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.480
 it's a really great idea.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.480
 It helps to sense when objects are nearer.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.480
 It's a really advanced bit of technology that they're working on,

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.480
 but you have the ability to, I guess, an advanced version of the walking stick

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.480
 that can help you find it's that kind of thing.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.480
 So they've been inventing that.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.480
 That's in a prototype stage at the moment.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.480
 I think it's like having whiskers basically.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.480
 That's something stuff around you. That's so cool.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.480
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.480
 And then this is not a suit, but a lady called Eleanor Bodnar,

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.480
 who's a scientist, invented a bra that doubles as a gas mask,

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.480
 which is really cool.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:53.480
 The idea is that in the event of a very chaotic moment of gas going off everywhere,

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.480
 you can just take the bra off and you can put it over your face.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480
 But it actually works.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.480
 Do you know there's some cows in Russia that are wearing bras?

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.480
 Really?

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.480
 In Siberia.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.480
 Why?

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.480
 Because it's so cold that the nipples will freeze if they don't wear these bras.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.480
 So how chogs can't quite get through the bra?

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.480
 They're fumbling around with the straps.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.480
 When they've scaled the sign, they can do it.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.480
 They can climb.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.480
 I won't go to the wall over this one.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.480
 Have they been moved?

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.480
 Because presumably they didn't evolve to be in Siberia where their nipples would be.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.480
 No, but of course there are farmers in Siberia and people need food and welcome.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.480
 Have cows in Siberia?

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.480
 They do in this place in Imiakon, which is in Siberia.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:44.480
 And the local civic leader said that the cows seem to like it

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.480
 because it can't be nice to have such cold teats.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.480
 Actually, just on cows, because they found the most amazing thing about cows the other day

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.480
 that maybe everyone knows.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.480
 But a lot of cows have windows in their stomachs.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:03.480
 So this is so we can study cows digestion and like work out how to feed them better, work out what they're attributing.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.480
 We've got these port holes, these transparent port holes,

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.480
 which we've done in a paint created in a painless operation,

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.480
 apparently according to the people who've done it.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.480
 According to the cows, according to the people who are cutting into the side of them.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.480
 It's so creepy though, you should look it up.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.480
 And it works exactly like a petrol cap on a car.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.480
 So you can unscrew it really easily if you're a vet, let's say.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.480
 You unscrew it and you can dip your arm into a cow's stomach

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.480
 and you pull out the contents of its stomach.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.480
 So one of the applications, for example, is if you've got a really sick cow

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.480
 that's not digesting stuff very well, then you go to the healthy cow

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.480
 that's got the window in its stomach and then you unscrew it

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.480
 and you put your hand in and you pick out the grass from in the stomach

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.480
 and you squeeze out its digestive juices

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.480
 because that cow has good digestive juices.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.480
 And then you insert the digestive juices into the sick cow

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.480
 and then you put the grass back in the cow's stomach

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.480
 and it's like nothing ever happened.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.480
 Isn't that bizarre?

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.480
 That is fine.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.480
 I've got to say if that had said all that, I wouldn't believe the word of it.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:05.480
 Hey, can I talk very quickly about how other people have dealt with their anger?

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.480
 Yeah, at least.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.480
 So anger management, Mel Gibson.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:13.480
 When he got in all the trouble he got into, he did an anger management course.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.480
 His first meeting immediately, he had a verbal argument

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:22.480
 with the guy leading the meeting over a name tag that he was wearing, saying,

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.480
 "I don't need to wear a name tag."

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.480
 Everyone knows what I'm fucking am already, don't they?

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.480
 And then the guy was like, "Okay, so I think you actually do need to do this course."

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.480
 In Dallas, there's a place you can go to called an anger room.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.480
 You can just basically smash it up.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.480
 They put a load of stuff there which is smashable.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.480
 They give you a baseball bat and they say, "Do your worst."

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:50.480
 You pay, I don't know, $50 for 15 minutes and you can smash up as much as you like

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.480
 and it's supposed to be a way to let it all out.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.480
 15 minutes is a long time to be that angry.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.480
 Actually, I've just found that.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.480
 So for five minutes you get something which is called, "I need a break."

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.480
 And you get five minutes in the anger room, so that's $25.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.480
 Okay, that sounds pretty good.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.480
 15 minutes is $45 and that's called the lash out session.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:16.480
 And for 25 minutes of total demolition, you have to pay $75.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.480
 Presumably, you need to pre-book to get your anger room.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.480
 So it must be when you're in the moment of absolute fury.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.480
 So imagine how bad the job is for the receptionist taking those phone calls.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.480
 Yeah, I need an anger room right now. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.480
 We don't have a room for another week.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.480
 That would be the worst job you could ever have.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.480
 So just quickly back to Herbert Spencer because he was a hilarious character.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.480
 Just one more funny thing about him.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.480
 He was obsessed with taking his pulse so he was a hyper-conductor and he used to when he went out in a carriage.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.480
 I think it was a bit afraid of travel when he went out in a carriage.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:00.480
 Then he suddenly shout out stop and in the middle of traffic in Piccadilly or Regent Street or whatever,

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.480
 the carriage would have to stop dead, all traffic's disrupted, silence rains.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.480
 And he has to consult the dictats of his pulse, this source says.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.480
 And if his pulse is too fast, the carriage immediately had to turn around and go home.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.480
 And if not, he could go on.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.480
 And similarly at train stations, he would bring, first of all, he'd bring a woman to train stations

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.480
 when he was going to get on a train specifically to read to him and then to wave him off as he departs.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:29.480
 And before getting on the train, he'd make his secretary take his temperature in a waiting room.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.480
 If his temperature was fine, they had to string up a hammock in first class and he was good to go.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.480
 If his temperature was too high, then he sent the train away and stayed behind.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:53.480
 So, wow, wow, wow, I'm sure you've got to be authorities to do that.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.480
 He sent the train away, well, he stayed behind, having his head wrapped in vinegar and brown paper.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.480
 Oh, really? That's the thing.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.480
 Yeah, it wasn't the thing. It was the thing.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.480
 It was the thing. It's in the first version of Jack and Jill.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.480
 Yeah, the second, the Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pile of water,

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:09.480
 jacked for down and broke his ground and jumped again, tumbling after. And then there's the second verse.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.480
 Oh, Jack Garts and Honda trought as fast as he could, Caper.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.480
 And...

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.480
 He went to bed and meant his head with vinegar and brown paper.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.480
 It's a Victorian version. There's some patched his knob with vinegar and brown paper, but they mean his head.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.480
 But that was an old word for your head. Your knob.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.480
 You know what?

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.480
 You can imagine the confusion.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.480
 Should we move on to our next act?

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.480
 Yeah, let's move on.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.480
 Yeah.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.480
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is my fact.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:42.480
 My fact this week is in order for Spider-Man to climb buildings, he would need size 89 feet.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.480
 So they've just worked this out. You may have seen it in the news.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:52.480
 They've just worked out that Spider-Man could not literally climb buildings with the size feet and hands that he has.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.480
 On the other hand, if he was called Hedgehog a man, he would have no problem.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.480
 Well, he could certainly get into a first floor flat.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:06.480
 Yeah, so I mean, it's just...

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.480
 Can we clarify what? Because I don't know Spider-Man as well as some.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:15.480
 So why we wouldn't need just have to have super strong superglue on his hands and then there could be any size.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.480
 Is it something to do with the surface area of his hands that causes them to stick to buildings?

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.480
 So I think what this is is it's done by zoologists, isn't it?

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.480
 Yes.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:29.480
 And these are people who are studying geckos that climb up and they use van der Waals forces on their hands and their paws to climb up things.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.480
 But it depends on how big the surface is, that how easy it is for them to hold on.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:38.480
 Now, if Spider-Man used this kind of tactic for climbing up walls and he'd need massive feet.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.480
 But do we know that he does?

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.480
 He could just be using superglue. The van der Waals force.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.480
 I don't know that superglue works that well because you just get stuck.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:52.480
 That's just seeing him right to the ground floor.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:59.480
 But the idea is turning a point because the weight increases so much with your volume.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.480
 So geckos use about 4% of their body surface area to climb.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:12.480
 And even smaller animals like mites, they use 0.02% because they're so light in comparison with the surface area that uses the force.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:20.480
 So for a human of the average weight to do it, you'd have to have adhesive pairs covering 40% of your body to climb.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.480
 And that's of your talking body, so it would be 80% of your front.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.480
 So you would need basically all of you to be sticking to the wall before you climb up it.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.480
 Wow. You'd have to shuffle up really weirdly.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:38.480
 Geckos actually, when they're sticking to walls and ceilings, they kind of walk on air, don't they?

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:43.480
 Because they trap. So they've got tiny hairs on their feet.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:49.480
 And that when they're on a wet surface, so usually on a wet surface, I think the van der Waals force would mean that you would slip off.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:54.480
 It would be too slippery, but they trap air bubbles between these little hairs.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:59.480
 And so essentially, when they're walking on a wet surface up a wall or on a ceiling, they're walking on a thin layer of air.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.480
 Wow. That's really cool. So they're hovering.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.480
 Yep. Exactly. They're hovercrafts.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:12.480
 That's incredible. Do you know that half the geckos in the world, half the species of geckos can't climb up walls?

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.480
 I don't know that. That's quite cool.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:23.480
 Sticky as salamander is a northern slimy salamander. And it's so sticky, it gives off this substance that's so sticky that if any predator tries to bite it,

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.480
 it's mucus immediately seals the predator's mouth shut.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.480
 Wow. That's a good kind of thing to have.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.480
 So cool. Yeah. God.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:38.480
 Just because we were saying about my idiot mistake, the fact that super glue would actually just stick you to a wall.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:46.480
 Flies have this problem, I think. So flies have sticky feet, so they can walk up walls and across ceilings.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:53.480
 But then they also have to have little claws on their legs so they can scrape their feet off once they when they need to move them.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.480
 So they stick to a surface and then they have to claw their leg off in order to move it again.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:04.480
 That's great. It's weird when you get to that kind of level of life where things become much more sticky,

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:09.480
 because water is a big problem for flies and other insects, because it's actually really sticky.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.480
 And apparently, surprisingly sticky for humans as well, water.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:19.480
 So if you get out of the shower, for example, if you get out of the shower, a lot of water sticks to you if you haven't wiped down properly.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:25.480
 When you get out of the shower, you're a pound heavier. That's how much the water weighs that is sticking to you as you get out of the shower.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.480
 That's very cool. Yeah. Some stuff on Spider-Man.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:35.480
 So the first Spider-Man comic is from 1962, but the word Spider-Man dates back to 1955.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:42.480
 And the word Spider-Man originally meant someone who works on very high structures like a steeplejack.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.480
 Really? That's very cool. That's good, isn't it?

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.480
 Why were they called... I guess they were just...

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:53.480
 Yeah, like a spider climbing up a wall or a hedgehog or whatever. They're like, you know, working somewhere really high.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:29:07.480
 And a lot of those guys were itsy bitsy as well. Spiders, just to quickly on climbing things, they have 600,000 micro hairs in contact walls.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:17.480
 600,000. And they can support... This has been studied by Germany's Institute of Technical Zoology, 170 times their own weight.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:28.480
 And the guys who studied this said, "That's like Spider-Man, clinging to the flat surface of a window by his fingertips and toes only while rescuing 170 adults who are clinging onto his back."

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.480
 Wow. Yeah. That's amazing.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.480
 It's not fantastic. Yeah. They are better than he is. And this is why there's a mystery about spiders.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:40.480
 The great spider mystery is why don't they stick to their own webs? Because they can support that and they've got all these tiny hairs.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:48.480
 But we don't quite know, but I think we think that they lick sort of lubricant onto their hairs, which means that they slide over their webs quite easily.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:59.480
 And someone in, I think, in 1905, a French naturalist tested this, so he put solvents on spiders' legs and he found out that once you did that, then it would dissolve the lubricant that they'd licked on.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:07.480
 And so they would stick to their webs. And then we decided to repeat the experiment recently and just pluck the legs off spiders and tested it again. And it's true.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.480
 So they lick, they salivate onto their legs to make sure they slide over their webs.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.480
 Okay. Wow.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:17.480
 I did some calculations about shoe sizes over this weekend.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:31.480
 So I worked out that if I was a foot, I would need a size 195 shoe. If it was a size 195 shoe and I was a foot, I would perfectly, my height would be able to lie perfectly inside the shoe.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.480
 Is that UK sizes? UK size, yeah.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.480
 Okay. Do you have a fun weekend?

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.480
 Honey, honey, quick, quick, puppy ideas, slowly I don't think it is.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.480
 Would you go face up or face down?

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.480
 If you were a foot.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.480
 No, I don't think this working guy is getting the respect it deserves.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.480
 How do you get something else?

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.480
 Yeah. If the UK was a foot.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:07.480
 Sweetie, no, no, this time it's really important, come back in.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:18.480
 If the UK was a foot, it would need a size 175 million, 874,974 shoe according to my calculations.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:23.480
 Which is approximately 200 million European size.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.480
 You just should have done it, if Italy was a foot.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:35.480
