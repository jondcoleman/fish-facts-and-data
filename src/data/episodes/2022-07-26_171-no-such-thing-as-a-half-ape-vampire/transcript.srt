00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,480
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,120
 of "No Such Thing" as a Fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,080
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,960
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I'm sitting here

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,440
 with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter Murray,

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,640
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,640
 and in no particular order, here we go.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,560
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,520
 My fact this week is that the Icelandic version

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,200
 of Agatha Christie's Lord Edgewear dies,

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,760
 took over 10 years to complete,

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,760
 because the translator couldn't work out

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,240
 how to translate two words.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,440
 - Firstly, spoiler alert in Lord Edgewear dies.

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,440
 - Yes.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,560
 (laughing)

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,440
 - You know what, I don't think you understand crime fiction, Andy,

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,680
 it's not like you have to wait till the end

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,280
 for the big reveal about who dies.

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,120
 (laughing)

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,960
 - What were the two words, Dan, do you know?

24
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,000
 - I don't know, so the reason I don't know is

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,400
 I read this in an article on the Guardian by the author,

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,720
 the translator of these books called Ragnar Yonneson,

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,400
 and I think for the reasons of not wanting

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,680
 to do the ultimate spoiler alert,

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,600
 he's not included the two words.

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,000
 - Because they're like the ultimate words

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,840
 in the whole story of it.

32
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,040
 - Yeah, so this is the thing.

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,720
 These two words are, it's a bit of wordplay

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,800
 that Agatha Christie used in the book.

35
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,920
 It's the clue, basically, to solving the murder.

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,680
 And in Iceland, he just couldn't work out how to do it.

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,800
 And he's been translating Agatha Christie books

38
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,160
 since he was 17 years old,

39
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,160
 and he started with Endless Night.

40
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,320
 The reason he picked it was 'cause it was the slimmest volume,

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,720
 but he convinced the publishing house

42
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,360
 that that was a really good one to start with.

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,440
 But it was actually, it was just really short.

44
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,720
 - He's quite a famous author in Iceland, I think.

45
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,080
 He is, yeah, Ragnar Yonneson, was it?

46
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
 - Yes.

47
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,960
 - And his books have been translated into English

48
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,400
 by a guy called Quentin Bates, who's also a writer,

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,880
 but I couldn't see if any of his books

50
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,880
 have been translated into other languages.

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,280
 According to him, the hardest thing about translating

52
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,920
 from Icelandic into English is punctuation,

53
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,040
 because full stop in Icelandic isn't necessarily the same

54
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,280
 as a full stop in English.

55
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,480
 And I think that's really interesting

56
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,160
 'cause you think it's all about the words

57
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,080
 that you have to translate,

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,880
 but if you have to translate the punctuation as well,

59
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,960
 that's pretty good, right?

60
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,760
 - Yeah, yeah.

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,440
 Do you know what a full stop is?

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,840
 - I think sometimes it can be a comma,

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,160
 or even a semicolon.

64
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,120
 - My pet peeve is people who put commas

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,160
 instead of full stops,

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,640
 and that Icelandic's are just doing it all over the shop.

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,000
 - Well, I think it's part of their actual language.

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,240
 - I'll allow it.

69
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,520
 - I can't believe we're not finding out these two words.

70
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,520
 Is the reason you didn't look into what they were,

71
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,320
 that you didn't want the spoiler?

72
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,040
 - I thought we couldn't actually mention it on the podcast.

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
 I thought the words would be.

74
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,440
 - Edgeworth is dead, is that it?

75
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,680
 - No, I think that's translatable.

76
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
 - Okay, fine.

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,560
 - Maybe it's Edgeworth Road,

78
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,400
 and the pun is that he's on a horse,

79
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,800
 but it also sounds like a tube stop.

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,120
 'Cause that'd be quite hard to translate

81
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,960
 into Icelandic.

82
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,080
 - Yeah, it would be really hard to translate.

83
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,760
 - Well, this is the interesting thing about translating, though,

84
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,680
 or simultaneous interpreters.

85
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,400
 Sometimes, if they have a speaker

86
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
 who makes loads of jokes,

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,360
 they find it really hard to do,

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,800
 because puns obviously are a nightmare for them,

89
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,640
 and they hate it.

90
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,480
 And one interpreter wrote in an academic article

91
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,880
 about interpreting puns based on a single word

92
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,080
 with multiple meanings in the source language

93
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,440
 should generally not be attempted by interpreters

94
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,760
 at the result will probably not be funny.

95
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,400
 - I think often puns in your own language,

96
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,600
 you should not attempt them,

97
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,760
 'cause the result won't be funny.

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,120
 I'm not targeting anyone specifically,

99
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,360
 but that case, I'm not gonna say anything

100
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,440
 for the rest of the podcast.

101
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,000
 One of my favorite translations is the Asterix books,

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,360
 and they're full of puns, aren't they?

103
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,000
 - Yes, yeah.

104
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,640
 - So they were full of puns in the original French,

105
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,200
 and then they were translated into English,

106
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,960
 and all the puns kind of still work.

107
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,080
 They all have names at a puns, basically.

108
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,160
 - Like get a fix.

109
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,840
 - Get a fix is the druid.

110
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,800
 So it's like getting his fix from him.

111
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,920
 Anyway, what I didn't know is that that was translated

112
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,120
 by two people, Derek Hockridge and Anthea Bell.

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,920
 An Anthea Bell is the sister of Martin Bell,

114
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,920
 the politician and broadcaster,

115
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,960
 and also the daughter of Adrian Bell,

116
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,080
 who was the first time's cryptic crossword setter.

117
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,920
 - Wow.

118
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,760
 - Wow.

119
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,160
 - And you can see the wordplay really working in that family.

120
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
 - Yeah.

121
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,000
 - That's amazing.

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 So, guess what the most translated work is?

123
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,840
 - The Bible.

124
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,600
 - The Bible, you're absolutely right.

125
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,520
 - Guess what the next most translated work is.

126
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,480
 - Or who is by?

127
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,960
 - Little Prince by Santac Superi.

128
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
 - Oh, that's really close.

129
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,600
 Okay, that one is in the top 10.

130
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,440
 - Ah!

131
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,560
 - Okay, I read recently that that got translated

132
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,760
 into its 300th language, that's why I say that.

133
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,720
 - Yeah, you're right, yeah, okay.

134
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,880
 The next three books after the Bible

135
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,880
 that are most translated in the world are all

136
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,960
 by the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Watchtower Society.

137
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,200
 - Oh, they go way out.

138
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,080
 - Seven out of 10 of the books

139
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,840
 are by the Jehovah's Witnesses in the top 10.

140
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,640
 The only secular ones are the Little Prince

141
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,240
 and the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

142
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,080
 - Right.

143
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,160
 - Which is a Zinger.

144
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,280
 - I don't count it if then, are they selling them

145
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,280
 the Jehovah's Witnesses or do they just thrust them on people?

146
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,840
 - Look, they're translating them into different languages

147
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,120
 and that's what counts.

148
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,640
 - I don't think people are buying those.

149
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,920
 - No, but it's not sales, it's just physical translation.

150
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,240
 - No, no, I know, but, you know, if you get a free Bible

151
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,480
 every time you get a church.

152
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,320
 - Yeah, that's true.

153
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,200
 The Bible should be classified as your heart too.

154
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,520
 - No, no, no, no, no.

155
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,480
 - No, church roofs are all falling down.

156
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,920
 - On Translators, I read in an article I was reading that

157
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,280
 when Obama was president, the US State Department

158
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,200
 received a message for him

159
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,240
 from the King of Bhutan and it was in the language,

160
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,200
 'Jonka', which I think is how you say it.

161
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,640
 And they needed it translated and so they went to

162
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,400
 the third Zonga translator and said,

163
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,040
 this is in the King of Bhutan, can you translate?

164
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,080
 Well, this message says to Obama,

165
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,400
 we need to know what the message is.

166
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,240
 And the translator says, no, I can't possibly translate that

167
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,920
 because it's in the royal version of the language

168
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,640
 and my eyes are not worthy to see it.

169
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,440
 - Oh, I know.

170
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,520
 - They had to look far and wide for another translator.

171
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,480
 Turn out the message was to wish him a happy new year.

172
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,680
 - It could have been a major diplomatic incident.

173
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,960
 - I think Thai has a royal language as well, don't they?

174
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,440
 But they tend to be not that different

175
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
 from the actual language.

176
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,880
 I can't remember if it's like that in Bhutan.

177
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,240
 - But even if it was only one tiny bit of difference,

178
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,200
 it's the fact of setting your eyes on it.

179
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,400
 - Yeah. - There will be a crime.

180
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,800
 - You know, it sounds like he could have read it, right?

181
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
 - Yeah, he could have read it.

182
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,480
 - He totally could have read it.

183
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,200
 - His eyeballs weren't worthy enough.

184
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
 - They would have exploded.

185
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,720
 - You know, happy new year by Abba,

186
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,480
 I wonder if they have a special version

187
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,000
 for the royal family in Bhutan.

188
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 (laughing)

189
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,960
 The only layer out of here.

190
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,400
 Does anyone know about the Icelandic translation of Dracula?

191
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,240
 - No.

192
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,280
 - So it was translated into Icelandic in 1900

193
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,640
 by Vladimir Asmonson.

194
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,720
 And it's a completely different book

195
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,040
 than the actual Dracula.

196
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,560
 And it sounds 10 times better.

197
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,120
 - Yeah. - How was it different?

198
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,440
 - Well, they have secret half ape vampires

199
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,440
 who sacrifice young maidens in the basement

200
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,480
 with lascivious glee.

201
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,080
 - Yeah, apparently it's much sexier.

202
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,960
 - We only discovered this really recently in 2014, I think.

203
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,800
 - But the Icelandic people have known it for ages.

204
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,880
 They've had the book, yeah.

205
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,440
 - But they haven't been reading the original genre.

206
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,520
 - No, yeah, yeah.

207
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,040
 - So this is only when someone went back

208
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,920
 to check something in 2014, this Dutch historian.

209
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,680
 And he was like, this is completely different.

210
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
 He said, I want to check something

211
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,760
 in the original text, please.

212
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,680
 - Oh, right, okay.

213
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,200
 - So I was saying that no one Icelandic in English

214
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,480
 had ever had a conversation in the last 115 years,

215
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,200
 where they both said, I've read Dracula.

216
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,040
 What did you think?

217
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,840
 Well, I like the half ape vampires sacrificing maidens

218
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,520
 in the basement.

219
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,360
 - I think it's not.

220
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
 - You know when you're a bit ashamed

221
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,920
 that you've forgotten most of the book that you've read,

222
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,000
 you're really like an idiot when you go, oh no.

223
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,160
 - Oh, yeah, I love those.

224
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,320
 - Yeah, I thought it was really good.

225
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,480
 - Yeah, that's my best bet.

226
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,320
 - Yeah.

227
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,960
 - But yeah, apparently sexier and much less tedious

228
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,800
 and punchier.

229
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
 - Well, Dracula is quite sexy already.

230
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
 This is sexier.

231
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,640
 - Yeah.

232
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,480
 - I mean, I had to read the original

233
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,840
 with a cushion in my lap.

234
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,120
 (laughing)

235
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,920
 - But what's interesting about it

236
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,520
 is that they're trying to work out

237
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,920
 how much involvement Bram Stoker had

238
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,960
 in the translation of the book.

239
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,720
 - And I think the implication is this translator,

240
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,960
 I couldn't have written something this good,

241
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,680
 in must have been an early Bram Stoker version.

242
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,160
 - It was the alternative that the translators

243
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,000
 had made it up.

244
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,840
 - Yeah.

245
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,680
 - In certain things.

246
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,560
 - Pretty much that he took the original story

247
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,160
 and thought, I can make this better.

248
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,000
 - Wow.

249
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,320
 - But this guy's saying, no, no one except Bram Stoker

250
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,400
 could have the imagination to come out

251
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,400
 with a half ape vampire in must have been him.

252
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,640
 (laughing)

253
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,000
 - I think you should read it, Andy.

254
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,840
 - I will.

255
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,360
 - Just think of all the cushions you'll need.

256
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,600
 (laughing)

257
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,040
 - So Iceland books generally, really interesting.

258
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,040
 They supposedly read more books

259
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,440
 and more books are published there

260
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,920
 per head than any country in the world.

261
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,760
 So one in 10 Icelanders are gonna write a book

262
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,600
 in their lifetime.

263
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,400
 - Yeah, I've read that fact loads of times

264
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,040
 and everyone says it's true

265
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,360
 and lots of really proper places say it's true

266
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,480
 and it almost certainly is true

267
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,320
 but I still don't believe it.

268
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,520
 - I know it's hard to believe, isn't it?

269
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,440
 - Yeah, in 10.

270
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,160
 - Well, there are only 300,000 of them.

271
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,720
 - Yeah, I think it's quite plausible.

272
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,600
 And you can get some real crap published these days

273
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,280
 and if you checked out the Sunday Times bestseller list.

274
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,320
 - Well, the BBC, they did a feature about Iceland's book world

275
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,560
 and they interviewed one novelist

276
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,960
 called Kristen A.Rick's Gdartier

277
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,000
 and she said, it is difficult,

278
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,480
 especially as I live with my mother and partner

279
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,720
 who are also full-time writers.

280
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,760
 But we try to publish an alternate years

281
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,680
 so we do not compete too much.

282
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
 - But they're in a constantly stressful household

283
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,080
 with people up against publishing deadlines.

284
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,920
 - I guess so.

285
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,160
 - So I guess they hate each other anyway.

286
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,000
 - Yeah.

287
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,520
 - That's where we're gonna be when we publish our book

288
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,120
 in two months' time at they hate each other stage.

289
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,240
 - So it makes sense slightly of this Icelandic publisher

290
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,560
 which I'm sure we all know about Tunglio.

291
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,800
 So Tunglio, these are the ones that they publish

292
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,240
 their books only on a full moon, the night of a full moon.

293
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,920
 They publish in batches of 69

294
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,120
 and if there are copies that are left over at the end

295
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,920
 of the night, they burn the copies.

296
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,960
 So it's this odd publisher where it allows for people

297
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,480
 to sort of get their book out

298
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,560
 but also not crowd the market.

299
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,360
 They say they take a lot of care and respect

300
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,760
 with the burning of the books.

301
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,960
 They fuel the flames with French cognac

302
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,280
 and it's all done very classily.

303
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,080
 - Always fully depending on your perspective.

304
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,400
 - There's a hate cognac as much as they hate books.

305
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,720
 (laughing)

306
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,000
 - Did you know George all well

307
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,920
 when animal farm was translated into French?

308
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,960
 It was called Les Animaux Pactoux

309
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,200
 which is animals everywhere

310
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,240
 but he wanted it to be called

311
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,040
 Union des Republiques Socialist Animal

312
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,480
 which is what it sounds like I guess

313
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,160
 through a public of socialist animals.

314
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,600
 That's because it would be shortened to U-R-S-A

315
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,120
 which is French for bear

316
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,600
 and of course that would be a nice

317
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,920
 another reference to the Russians.

318
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,000
 - Oh, that's so clever.

319
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,600
 - But they didn't go with it.

320
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,560
 They went with animals everywhere, exclamation marks.

321
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,960
 - We just sounds like a fun romper.

322
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,800
 - It does.

323
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,920
 - It sounds like a kids book

324
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,120
 where there's a mistake at the zoo

325
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,320
 and animals get everywhere.

326
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
 (laughing)

327
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,000
 - Yeah, is there a bear in animal farm?

328
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,840
 - No.

329
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
 - It's mostly farm animals.

330
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,680
 - Yeah.

331
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,560
 - Is there a half ape vampire?

332
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,400
 - Lots of those, yeah.

333
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
 - It goes landing version.

334
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,880
 You can't move forward.

335
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,920
 (laughing)

336
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
 I've one final thing about translation.

337
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,560
 It's really tangential though.

338
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,400
 But there is a thing called

339
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,440
 the crew and equipment translation aids

340
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,720
 which is on the International Space Station.

341
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,480
 It's a miniature train.

342
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,960
 There's a miniature train on the outside

343
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,440
 of the International Space Station.

344
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,280
 - What?

345
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,120
 - Yeah.

346
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,960
 I know.

347
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,680
 And it's also called the mobile transporter

348
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,320
 and that's to say that it is simultaneously

349
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,880
 the fastest and slowest train in the universe.

350
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,720
 - Wow.

351
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,080
 - It's because it's spinning around the earth.

352
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,920
 - Exactly.

353
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,760
 - And the slowest because it takes 10 days

354
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,840
 to get to the next person.

355
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,480
 - Yeah, it moves at one inch per second, top speed.

356
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,320
 - Wow.

357
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,160
 (laughing)

358
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,000
 - Well, have they not heard of Southern Rail?

359
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,760
 (laughing)

360
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,360
 (upbeat music)

361
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,320
 (upbeat music)

362
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,880
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

363
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,000
 - Okay, my fact this week is out of the 360 million

364
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,280
 common bears made every year less than 1%

365
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,200
 are actually common bear.

366
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,040
 - Hmm.

367
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,760
 That's not the fact I've got down here.

368
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,600
 - No.

369
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,440
 - For what you said.

370
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,280
 - What have you got?

371
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,480
 - Out of the 360 million wheels

372
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,000
 of camembert produced every year,

373
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,520
 only four are actually common bear.

374
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,080
 Well, that would be less than 1%,

375
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,520
 but it would be a lot less than 1%.

376
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,640
 So this, that was my original fact admittedly.

377
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,760
 (laughing)

378
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,400
 And I read it in the independent

379
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,880
 and I think when they said just four are true common bear,

380
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,360
 I think they meant four million.

381
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
 (laughing)

382
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,200
 - Yes.

383
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,160
 - The disappointing discovery we all made this morning

384
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,320
 is we started research.

385
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,800
 - I would have thought unbelievably expensive cheeses

386
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,240
 on the market every year.

387
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,080
 - Yeah.

388
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,000
 - If you just have four small wheels of camembert produced.

389
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 So what it is is the French have a protected designation

390
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,080
 of origin label which they put on real camembert.

391
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,880
 And in order to be a real camembert,

392
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,000
 you have to have used unfiltered raw milk.

393
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,880
 Your cows can only be fed grass and hay from local pastures.

394
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,320
 You're not allowed to move the milk more

395
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,080
 than a couple of fields before you make the cheese.

396
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,720
 You need to ladle it by hand

397
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,960
 and the milk has to have a fat content of at least 38%.

398
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,760
 And if you don't follow any of those rules,

399
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,320
 you can still sell camembert like cheese,

400
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,840
 but it's not the official camembert stuff.

401
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,600
 And I thought when I first read it,

402
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,680
 that only four cheeses managed to do that,

403
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,240
 but actually it seems about four million,

404
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,240
 which is still only 1%, which means more often than not.

405
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,560
 If you're buying a random camembert cheese,

406
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,280
 it's likely to not be the real deal.

407
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,680
 - So is it, would it somewhere on the package subtly say that?

408
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,120
 - So the, the stuff which doesn't have that label

409
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,800
 is usually labeled camembert fabric on Normandy.

410
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,640
 - But it is cam, it is like a lot of places,

411
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,080
 you know, you can't use the actual name of something

412
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
 unless it's made in the place it was made or in a certain way.

413
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,760
 But it is camembert, all this other stuff,

414
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
 it's just not made the Normandy way

415
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,600
 that camembert makers in France think camembert should be made,

416
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,240
 the proper way, right? - It's not the real deal.

417
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,160
 - It's not the real deal. - Yeah, yeah.

418
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,480
 - I can't believe cheese generally in shops isn't the real deal.

419
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,600
 - No idea until I started looking into this.

420
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,360
 - What do you mean? - It's all ham.

421
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,840
 - It's some ham.

422
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:18,000
 - The sort of regulations of what can be labeled as cheese

423
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,040
 means that only 51% of the product needs to be cheese.

424
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,800
 - Wow. - The rest of it can be something else.

425
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,680
 But if 51% of it is cheese, then you can call it a cheese.

426
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,120
 - So what if we just sell smaller blocks of cheese

427
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,640
 just next to some wood?

428
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,040
 - 'Cause people wouldn't buy that, would they?

429
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
 - I guess they wouldn't.

430
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,880
 - I don't know.

431
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,800
 - That's why my little shop closed down.

432
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,000
 (laughing)

433
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,760
 - There was a kind of cheese war

434
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,920
 over the camembert thing in 2007.

435
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,240
 When I say a war, I mean a minor legal dispute.

436
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,400
 But all the big producers wanted to say proper camembert

437
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,200
 is the stuff we're making.

438
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,800
 Even though the milk is pasteurized

439
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,440
 and the cows actually have come from elsewhere

440
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,720
 and they're eating grass from somewhere else still

441
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,520
 and all of the stuff and there's not 38% fat.

442
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,600
 It was a big legal dispute.

443
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,240
 The courts came down on the side of the little guy

444
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,160
 who was only making 1% of the cheese.

445
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

446
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,000
 - Good for the courts.

447
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,240
 They were always the good guy, the courts.

448
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,080
 - Yep.

449
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,440
 (laughing)

450
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,320
 - Do you know there was only one family making camembert

451
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,320
 until around the 1870s and they were the direct descendents

452
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,800
 of the lady who invented it, supposedly Marie Harrell.

453
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,960
 - There were good PR people.

454
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,160
 So I think her grand son,

455
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,720
 oh maybe grandson in law, met Napoleon III

456
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,440
 and brought a big wheel of cheese to a show.

457
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,040
 So then he became the imperial supplier.

458
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,880
 So then camembert was a big deal there.

459
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,320
 And they also made it in 1813.

460
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,720
 They made it an honorary citizen of the city of Cayenne.

461
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
 - The cheese. - Yeah.

462
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,520
 So camembert became an honorary citizen.

463
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,080
 - The pepper must have been pretty pissed off

464
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
 if that hadn't been the--

465
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,800
 (laughing)

466
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,560
 - Give it the cheese to the city.

467
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,560
 - Very good. - Nice.

468
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,880
 - Yeah. - Yeah, strong.

469
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,840
 - Guys, have you heard of the Mondial du Frommage?

470
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,880
 - No. - Okay, strap in.

471
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,280
 - This is the world's greatest cheese mungering competition.

472
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,120
 - Oh yeah.

473
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,840
 - This is to be the best cheese munger, okay?

474
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,600
 It happened in France and this year

475
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,160
 the first ever American got a medal.

476
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,440
 I think an American came third in the competition.

477
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,000
 But it's held every other year and it is so hard.

478
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,280
 It starts with a 20 question written exam.

479
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,760
 Then there's a blind taste test.

480
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,680
 You have to get the name, how it was made,

481
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,720
 the region, the milk used, and how long it was aged.

482
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,560
 - Wow.

483
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,160
 - Then you have to cut four identical 25 gram pieces of cheese

484
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,920
 by hand with no measuring tools.

485
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,520
 You have to cut four identical size pieces of cheese.

486
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,960
 Then there's a five minute speech

487
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,720
 where you have to present a cheese to the judges

488
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
 and say why it's good.

489
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,920
 Then there's a swimsuit round.

490
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,880
 (laughing)

491
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,360
 That's the first morning.

492
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,920
 Then there's more in the afternoon.

493
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,120
 And one 2015 competitor said the afternoon

494
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,080
 is the four hardest hours of cheese.

495
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,240
 You couldn't have had it.

496
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,160
 (laughing)

497
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,800
 You have to make a cheese plate for the judges

498
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,520
 and then do a carving out of cheese

499
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,120
 and then do a large cheese board.

500
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,040
 And you have to justify all your decisions.

501
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,760
 - And what do you get at the end when you've done all this?

502
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,440
 - I don't think there's a big, yeah,

503
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,600
 there's probably a small medal or a cash prize

504
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,800
 or not a big cash prize.

505
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
 But you just get the honor of being

506
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,440
 the greatest cheese munger in the world.

507
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
 - That's right.

508
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,280
 - Yeah.

509
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,120
 - Sounds really fun.

510
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,880
 - They take it very seriously, don't they?

511
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,000
 They've got a brotherhood of the Knights of Camembert

512
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,120
 tasting, which is like a Mason society

513
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,800
 for Camembert tasteers.

514
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,000
 And they all have this huge fancy dress festival

515
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,880
 once a year where they dress up like Mason's

516
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,120
 and they have this like really solemn.

517
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,360
 - Come on.

518
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,200
 - Yeah, you were thicker.

519
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,040
 - You were thicker cheese.

520
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,400
 - Yeah, of course you were.

521
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,440
 - You can't go as a bit, it's a serious festival.

522
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,920
 - A fancy dress.

523
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,680
 - It's a fancy dress, a fancy like Mason's dress.

524
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,600
 A fancy dress brackets, but be a Mason.

525
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,960
 - I'm not about you to our fancy dress party.

526
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
 (laughing)

527
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,800
 She's come as a Mason again.

528
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,960
 - Which cheese would you go as James?

529
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,920
 - I think I'd go as a baby bell.

530
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,040
 - That's a good one.

531
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,440
 - What would the wrapper honor off?

532
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,640
 - Half on actually.

533
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,480
 - In hot wax.

534
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,400
 - I would paint my face red, half of it.

535
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,200
 And then I'd shave my hair.

536
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
 And the top of it would like be the open bit

537
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,720
 of the baby bell and the button bit would be the close bit.

538
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,080
 - So it's just your head that's the baby bell.

539
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,560
 - Yeah, and the rest of my body

540
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,680
 I'll shape like a plate.

541
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,040
 (laughing)

542
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,880
 - Well that's a good idea.

543
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,120
 - This is one of the rounds in the Mondialdi firmware.

544
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,960
 (laughing)

545
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,440
 - I think I'd go as a Swiss cheese.

546
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,280
 - What'd you?

547
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,120
 - Yeah.

548
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,960
 - How would you make the holes?

549
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,600
 - I'd fill a sheet with holes and I wear the sheet.

550
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,120
 A yellow sheet obviously.

551
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,720
 - Would you wear anything under the sheets?

552
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,560
 - No.

553
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,640
 - You'd be very careful where you put the holes.

554
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,680
 (laughing)

555
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,960
 - What would you go as Anna?

556
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,600
 - I don't know, I can't think of any cheese string maybe.

557
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,440
 - Cheese string.

558
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,680
 - Yes, like peel bits off myself as the evening went on.

559
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,520
 - That's great.

560
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,000
 - You could put all your hair up straight

561
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,160
 and then slowly like take the strands off of it.

562
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,000
 - Make it down.

563
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Yes, 'cause I was actually thinking of panning

564
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,320
 to peel off my entire skin,

565
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,760
 which would have been a real asshole as sacrifice.

566
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,480
 - Dan's gonna get a lump of cheese,

567
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,520
 which is 51% bigger than him.

568
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,360
 - Yeah.

569
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,520
 - You just stand next to him.

570
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
 - I was gonna do.

571
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,200
 - Now I was gonna go as a leg of ham.

572
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,040
 - Just really.

573
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,480
 (laughing)

574
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,320
 - Charlotte Goal once said,

575
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,480
 "How do you govern a country

576
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,240
 which has 246 varieties of cheese?"

577
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,080
 (laughing)

578
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,240
 What was the answer?

579
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,680
 (laughing)

580
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,880
 - It was a rhetorical question.

581
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,720
 - Oh, one of those.

582
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,880
 - But the answer is you sought out

583
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,360
 the massive competition to work out

584
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,240
 who's the best cheese monger.

585
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,480
 - And actually, you just reduced the numbers of cheese.

586
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,040
 So they've got far fewer cheeses than when he would have said that.

587
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,640
 I think they've lost 50 cheeses in the last 30 years.

588
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,480
 - No.

589
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,880
 - And there's something called the Slow Food Organization,

590
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,640
 which is trying to save endangered cheese

591
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,400
 and other endangered food stuff, actually.

592
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,400
 But yeah, it's like lots of artists and cheeses have disappeared.

593
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,600
 - Britain has more cheeses than France now, don't we?

594
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,200
 - Yes.

595
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,120
 And they're better.

596
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
 - Well, I don't know.

597
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,920
 - I don't like any of them.

598
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,240
 - Got, so are they actually extinct cheeses

599
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,400
 or can we reproduce them as in have the recipes been lost?

600
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,240
 - Oh, no, the recipes will be there.

601
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,200
 It's just like how everything when it starts being done

602
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,160
 on a large scale, the little artists and producers get lost.

603
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,960
 - But the other thing is a lot of these rely

604
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,480
 on certain strains of bacteria.

605
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,560
 So it could be that those strains have gone.

606
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,080
 - Oh, yeah, they might have gone extinct.

607
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,920
 You're right.

608
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
 - And even if you get it back,

609
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,000
 you don't know whether you've got exactly the right one anymore.

610
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,480
 - Unless there's like a super old guy in the village

611
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,920
 who remembers the taste of the extinct cheese

612
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,680
 and you bring it to him and you let him sample.

613
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
 - Yeah, I think there is one of those

614
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,120
 in every French village, actually.

615
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,200
 - They just keep one old guy.

616
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

617
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
 - Cheese taste, sir.

618
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,440
 - Do you guys know about the world's most dangerous cheese?

619
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,280
 - Oh, no.

620
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,160
 - Is it the cheese rolling people,

621
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,880
 'cause they're always injuring themselves, aren't they?

622
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,800
 In Gloucestershire, they always run down a hill after some cheese.

623
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,040
 - Oh, yeah, and you're saying that cheeses,

624
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,280
 the world's most dangerous one, they're chasing after, yeah.

625
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,920
 - It's not the cheeses fault, admittedly.

626
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,040
 - That's like saying foxes are really dangerous,

627
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,080
 'cause a lot of people get injured on fox hunts.

628
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,200
 You know, it's not actually the foxes fault, is it?

629
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,040
 - No.

630
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,880
 - Anyway, it's not that.

631
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,120
 - Is it something that's not pasteurised and might make you sick?

632
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,720
 - Oh, is it the one that's full of maggots?

633
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,880
 - It is one that's got, yeah, cassoumazu.

634
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,200
 Have we talked about that before?

635
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,040
 - Oh, I think so.

636
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,880
 - It's great.

637
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,080
 So it's from Sardinia, it's actually illegal.

638
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,960
 I think the EU banned it a few years ago,

639
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,120
 but you can still get it on the black market.

640
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,960
 And yeah, the way you make it is

641
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,880
 you infest pecorino cheese with maggots,

642
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,560
 with these cheese fly maggots.

643
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,720
 And they eat the cheese and then they excrete it

644
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,560
 while they're inside.

645
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,760
 And that's what adds the flavour.

646
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,840
 So apparently it's really kind of creamy,

647
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,200
 'cause their excretion of the cheese

648
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,360
 and the way they processed it is tangy and aromatic.

649
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,560
 - Do you have to eat the maggots?

650
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,880
 - You do eat the maggots, yeah, 'cause they're inside.

651
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,720
 - You have to.

652
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,880
 - But it's quite hassle picking them out, I think.

653
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
 - They jump out at you if I remember rightly.

654
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,720
 - That's what people say.

655
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,760
 You have livery all these maggots.

656
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,600
 - I don't know.

657
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,240
 - You've got to be careful of not getting hit in the face.

658
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,400
 - So why is it dangerous to people die?

659
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,040
 - Well, on the EU decided on hygiene grounds.

660
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,520
 I don't think there have been any deaths related to it.

661
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,320
 So it's probably just health and safety gone mad.

662
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,840
 - I would be the fast-pot sitting there

663
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,640
 picking out every single maggot.

664
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,160
 - You could just eat around the maggots.

665
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,520
 - Yeah, I just want to eat the maggot excrement.

666
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,200
 Thank you very much.

667
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,680
 - I think I'd go for a slightly less flavour some cheese,

668
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,400
 but without the maggots in it.

669
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,080
 I'm willing to put up with a slightly less flavour.

670
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,240
 - I think that's a good idea.

671
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,560
 - Yeah, I like cheddar.

672
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,000
 I'll just have cheddar.

673
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,600
 (upbeat music)

674
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,720
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

675
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,080
 My fact is that Norway's coastline is so long

676
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,760
 that if you took a piece of string along it

677
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,800
 and then stretched it out,

678
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,640
 it would run around the whole planet two and a half times.

679
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,040
 Okay, so it needs to be quite a long piece of string.

680
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,240
 - Yeah, you don't get balls of string

681
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,000
 that big, I don't think, in your local hog restaurant.

682
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,960
 - You would buy a few and then tie them together.

683
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,760
 - Yeah, I was dreaming about this last night actually.

684
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,840
 - Weirdly, it was genuinely in my dream.

685
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,920
 I thought what if you had a long enough string

686
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,480
 that could go around the world,

687
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,680
 which would be shorter than the string you need for Norway, right?

688
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,920
 'Cause you need two and a half, two and a half of those.

689
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,520
 If you managed to get that kind of string

690
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,600
 and you tied it to the coast of, let's say England,

691
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,120
 and you just set off, could you wrap the world in that string

692
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,840
 if you went completely around?

693
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,600
 - I suppose in theory you could.

694
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,200
 But here's something for you.

695
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,440
 Imagine you added three feet of string

696
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,880
 to that one that's going all the way around the world

697
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,640
 and then you made it tight.

698
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,440
 How much above the surface of the earth would it be?

699
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,920
 - Oh, you know what I mean by that?

700
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,760
 - Yeah, yeah.

701
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,680
 - Hold on, so you could lift it a bit loose if you had three feet.

702
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,320
 - Dan's holding a piece of string.

703
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,760
 I carry it all the way around the world

704
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,600
 and then give him the other end.

705
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,920
 And then we add an extra three feet of string to it.

706
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,640
 How much higher would it go?

707
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,480
 - I would say it will basically not be higher at all.

708
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,240
 - Yeah, like a fraction of a minimum.

709
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,080
 - That's what you think.

710
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,920
 The actual answer is 5.7 inches, about six inches.

711
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,760
 - Wow.

712
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,600
 - And it's basically maths and the circumference of a circle.

713
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,200
 And this six inch difference is the same

714
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,080
 whether it's the size of the earth

715
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,400
 or whether you just put it around your stomach, for instance.

716
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,240
 - No.

717
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,320
 - If you had the three feet, it would just move out

718
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,600
 by that amount.

719
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,440
 - Wow.

720
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,280
 - That is amazing.

721
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,680
 - That is really cool.

722
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,680
 - That is an old paradox which was originally,

723
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,760
 the earliest I found of it was 1702.

724
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,600
 - Oh, cool.

725
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,320
 - Book by William Whitston.

726
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,280
 - I don't really understand that, but I'm very impressed.

727
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,840
 - Yeah, it's super cool.

728
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,680
 - So just on Norway quickly.

729
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,800
 This was sent to me actually by a guy on Twitter called

730
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,560
 at YPLAC.

731
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,280
 He used work for a ferry company in Norway.

732
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,440
 - For a string company.

733
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,600
 (laughing)

734
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,760
 - He's got shares of that.

735
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,320
 And he said that he learned if you took a piece of string

736
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,480
 and ran it along Norway's coastline,

737
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,000
 you could run it from London to Bangkok and back again.

738
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,960
 But that might have been before,

739
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,040
 there was a recalculation of the coast of Norway

740
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
 by some geographers in 2011.

741
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,680
 And the basic point is that Norway

742
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,880
 is one of the most complicated coastlines on the planet

743
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,800
 because it has all these fields

744
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,160
 where instead of going straight north to south,

745
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,800
 it goes in for a hundred miles

746
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,720
 and then out for a hundred miles again.

747
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,200
 So you've added 200 miles to the coast

748
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,000
 even though you're only 50 meters further along it.

749
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,840
 - Yeah.

750
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,840
 - So Norway's unbelievably crinkly.

751
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,800
 - Yeah, I think they added,

752
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,600
 if you leave out the fjords it's 1573

753
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,000
 and if you include them it's 18,000 miles of coastline.

754
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,480
 - Wow, it is unbelievable.

755
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,040
 - But that's, I was looking into the biggest coastlines

756
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,280
 in the world by numbers and Canada's number one.

757
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,120
 - Yeah.

758
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,120
 - But what Canada you'd be able to go around the earth five times?

759
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,480
 - Yes, yeah.

760
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,680
 And what kind of shock to me was that

761
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,280
 Japan is ahead of Australia,

762
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,880
 which doesn't make sense when you think about it

763
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,280
 because if you look at the sizes of the two places,

764
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,760
 Australia's got way more coast,

765
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,320
 but what Japan has is all these tiny islands,

766
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,000
 which constitute being Japan.

767
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,360
 So when you add all of them up,

768
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,600
 they're ahead of Australia.

769
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,440
 - Yeah, it's nuts.

770
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,400
 - Yeah, this is why this fact is strange, right?

771
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,560
 Because actually every list could be different, right?

772
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
 In terms of the longest coastline

773
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,160
 depending on the way that you're measuring it.

774
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,440
 So a coastline can be infinitely long.

775
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,920
 So imagine you've got a meter long ruler

776
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,320
 then you're only measuring a contour every meter.

777
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,280
 And so it's going to be much, much shorter

778
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,640
 than if you go around with a one centimeter measure

779
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,760
 and you'll measure much more lumps and bumps.

780
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,600
 It's like if you've got a 30 centimeter ruler

781
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,960
 with some lumps and bumps in it,

782
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,480
 and then you actually ran a string

783
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,040
 all the way in and out of the lumps and bumps,

784
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,640
 that piece of string would be much longer than 30 centimeters.

785
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,800
 So actually, Norway's coastline could theoretically go

786
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,240
 to the end of the universe and back.

787
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,200
 - Well, it's not quite infinite because there's a minimum length

788
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,880
 that you can have, which is a plank length.

789
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
 You can't measure anything smaller than the plank length,

790
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:42,880
 but that is really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,

791
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,600
 20th century when and the first person to really work it out was a guy called Lewis Frey Richardson

792
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,240
 who wanted to work out whether the likelihood of two countries going to war depended on the length

793
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,120
 of their border. Okay, so he looked at a load of different borders and for instance when he looked

794
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,360
 at the Spain Portugal border he found that Spain thought it was 987 kilometers but Portugal thought

795
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,760
 it was 1214 kilometers. They immediately went to war over the world. Why did Stalin 300 kilometers of

796
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,720
 our border? And then it was picked up by Mandel Brotton, all the mathematicians who did all this

797
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,120
 fractal stuff. Yeah, he was amazing. So I hadn't really heard of him before this but he was a

798
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,280
 mathematician and he wrote an academic paper which was called How Long is the Coast of Britain

799
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,560
 and he said it's impossible for the same reason that the closer you look the more crinkly something

800
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:40,640
 gets. But Norway is special so Norway has a larger what they call a fractal dimension than other

801
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,400
 countries. Really? It just is more crinkly. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so on the fjords, the fjords,

802
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:53,120
 the deepest fjord, this one was actually also said to me by @whyblack, the deepest fjord is so deep

803
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,120
 that if you got to the deepest point of the deepest one, right, you know the Burj Khalifa,

804
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,560
 the tallest building in the world, you could strap the Empire State Building to the top of the

805
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:10,240
 Burj Khalifa and drop the whole thing into the deepest fjord and it would still be more than 100

806
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,960
 metres from the surface. It's a lot of effort just to prove that point, isn't it? You won't be able to

807
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,600
 see it because it's underwater, so I don't know. I think I just believe it. And also the Burj Khalifa

808
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,200
 is very pointy at the top but actually you should probably put the Empire State Building at the

809
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,720
 bottom and then the Burj Khalifa on top. No, because you've got a very pointy bit at the top of the

810
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,040
 Empire State Building as well. They're both pointy at the top. It's not going to work. Are you counting,

811
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,080
 are you counting the pointy bit at the top of the Empire State Building? You know the bit that

812
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,720
 they used to attach blimps to. All right, it's probably 96 metres from the top. If you don't count

813
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,040
 the bit these attached blimps to. But you could, if you put the Empire State Building at the bottom,

814
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,520
 then you could use the spike to impale the other one on top of and that would be how you welded

815
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,880
 them together. You could do the same the other way around though. You could impale the bottom of the

816
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,720
 Empire State. Yeah, no, you're right. It's a thank you for coming up with the solution. Yeah,

817
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,920
 I think it's a good idea. I think we should do it. I reckon just like normal measuring equipment

818
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:05,840
 like Sona might be better. Yeah. I'm so sorry for reading out a fact that someone sent me,

819
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,600
 which is a very I think visually creative means of telling you the depth of a fjord. Imagine if

820
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,000
 we did measure stuff using skyscrapers every time we had to measure something new. We had to take

821
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,920
 down the skyscrapers and drop it in an ocean. If we measured the coastline of Norway with the

822
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:27,600
 Burj Al Khalifa, it would be a lot shorter. Yeah. That's a very good point. So we should do it.

823
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:37,840
 Just one more thing on Norway's amazing engineering feats. There's a little town called Rukken.

824
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,400
 It's R.J.U. K.A.N. How does it say? Right, you can. Right, you can. Oh my god.

825
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:49,680
 Yeah, there's a little town called Rukken. And it's got 3,400 people there and the problem that

826
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,360
 this town has had forever really is that it's in amongst the mountain range and it's constantly in

827
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,120
 shade. So for a lot of the year, they just don't see sun. They can see sun at the top of the mountain,

828
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,040
 hitting the mountain, but they're just covered in shade. It's been a massive problem and there's

829
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,880
 been tiny things to sort of try and fix it like a service, a cable car service was started. So you

830
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,920
 could pay a small amount. Go up the cable car and just experience some sun and then come back down

831
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:21,600
 again as a little ride. So they've recently fixed it. This is a few years ago now. An engineer came

832
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,560
 up with an idea of creating three massive solar powered mirrors that now reflect the sun

833
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,840
 into the valley and now they live in sunlight again and it tracks where the sun is going throughout

834
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,480
 the day. So the mirror moves towards it to make sure the sunlight is always pushing down. So

835
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,600
 this town that was in permanent shade is now sunny all the time. It's now being constantly

836
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,120
 fried by trying to be concentrated beams of heat. If you want to kill an ant, go to Rukken.

837
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,760
 That is amazing. It's cool. I mean, what a solution. But then you also think why build a town there

838
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,960
 in the first place? Yes, exactly. I guess it's easier than moving the town to the top of the mountain.

839
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,120
 Yeah, but it's not like 50 years ago that town would have been in the sunshine. No, you're right.

840
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,480
 Maybe the mountain's grown. You know how Everest has grown a bit or shrunk a bit. Perhaps the

841
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,360
 mountain's grown by 100 meters or so. Everest is shrunk by one inch. So perhaps the exact same

842
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:21,360
 thing is haven't except in reverse and to a much greater faster extent. Also, my lawn is growing

843
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,040
 at the moment and the bit of it isn't growing very well because it's in the shade a lot because it's

844
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:31,200
 next to the vents. So where can I get these mirrors? A mirror store? I'm guessing. Oh, you want the

845
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,840
 solar powered ones? Yeah, really. I mean, that's going to be better, isn't it? I need to go to Rukken.

846
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,640
 Yeah, steel one. The lich has been left in darkness due to one Englishman's whim.

847
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:52,480
 Okay, it is time for our final, we say fact.

848
00:31:52,480 --> 00:32:02,240
 And that is Adich Zitsky. My facts this week is that, now prepare yourselves for this, you've got

849
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,480
 to focus. Beef stroganov is named after the great grandson of the person who brought human

850
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:16,400
 chest to Russia. That's a great fact. It's a stroganov part of beef stroganov we're talking about.

851
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:23,280
 Not, not, it's a beef. It was constantly getting into fights with people. His

852
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:32,000
 crest was a big cow in the worst. What's your beef? It wasn't beef. It was a stroganov family. So

853
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,080
 this was a big noble family in Russia from, I'd been thinking about the 16th century, but certainly

854
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,240
 under the 19th and early 20th century. So there was Count Alexander stroganov, who in the very

855
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,000
 early 19th century decided to turn his townhouse lawn into a chessboard, a giant chessboard for fun,

856
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 and he had his servants beat all the pieces, and he dressed them all up as a different pieces.

857
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,800
 And then he had the game be orchestrated by chess players. So there was one that was, there were two

858
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,720
 grandmasters at the time, or I don't know if they had grandmasters, but players of the time

859
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,120
 called Count Ivan Osterman and Lev Nalyishkin, and they told the servants were to move and they moved.

860
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:16,000
 And that was introducing chess to Russia. Human chess. Human chess. And then, fast forward a hundred

861
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:26,240
 years, his great-grandson is called Pavel Sergeyevich stroganov, and he apparently had a chef

862
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,520
 who came up with stroganov the dish and named it after this family. And there are some stories

863
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,080
 that say that it was his grandfather, Pavel, who initially inspired it, and it had been the

864
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,680
 family for years. So maybe it was named after the chess guy's son, but our first mention of

865
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:48,320
 stroganov that we have is from the 1880s, 1890s, and named after Pavel. I think we think that probably

866
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,960
 isn't named after him, right? It's probably named after the family. Yeah, it'll be named after

867
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,280
 the family, yeah. Anyway, I just love this connection. Also, I just spent a long time reading about

868
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,280
 the stroganov family. It is a connection between two things that you wouldn't say a

869
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:07,760
 household item really. It's not like the guy who invented the fork is the grandson of the guy who

870
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,240
 invented dogs. I play human chess. The fork came up with a dog. I'm saying it's not that. It's the

871
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,520
 other way around. The grandson of the guy who invented the dog who invented the fork. Wow.

872
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:26,880
 I have a couple of human chess pieces in my house. Do you mean humans? Yeah, I do. So actually,

873
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:33,920
 you know, I just call that a household item. That's good for you. I didn't really think much about

874
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,000
 it until starting researching this fact. I didn't realise that it was a big thing in, for example,

875
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,760
 Russia, and there's a festival in Italy. It's not a big thing. It's not a big thing. Actually,

876
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,400
 I don't think you'll continue thinking about it after we've researched this fact. Yeah,

877
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,640
 but it is a thing that happens sometimes. So there is a place in Italy which has one massive

878
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,040
 match every two years and they dress up in historical costume. And I think they actually act out a

879
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,680
 particular chess game. Oh, yeah. Yes, they do. It's one that was written about in a novel. This is in

880
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,840
 Maro Stiecker, isn't it? Yes, it is. Isn't it the story of a famous match played between two

881
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:14,640
 knights who were both wanting to court a princess and the winner was allowed to court the princess?

882
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,680
 What? Yeah, I think that's the story behind it. Well, neither of them could get to it because they

883
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,040
 could only move two steps forward or one step to the side. Wait, hang on. That's the story of how we

884
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,560
 got a human chess. No, the story of the game that's played every two years, the exact game.

885
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,320
 In Maro Stiecker, that's what they're celebrating. Supposedly, the original game that they were

886
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,840
 following, the moves of were played by two knights. We've played a game of normal chess. And it's

887
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,160
 written about in a fictional story in the early 20th century. Yeah, and none of it's real.

888
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,440
 Have you heard of chess city? It's in Russia? No. Okay, it's in one of the southern provinces.

889
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:53,520
 It's southwest Russia. And it's in a town called Elista. And there's an enclave in that town,

890
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:00,800
 which is a mini chess city. And it was built by our old friend, Kirsán Iliongenov, who

891
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:08,080
 until 2010 was the leader of this province. And he is also the head of the International

892
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,160
 and Chess Federation. He's the one who claims to have been abducted by aliens. And he thinks

893
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,360
 that Sweet Corn and Chess are from outer space or something. Exactly. And in 1998 to host the 33rd

894
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:23,360
 Chess Olympiad, he built Chess City, which has a chess museum, a large open-air chessboard,

895
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,080
 and a museum of Buddhist art. Wow. Because there are a lot of Buddhist living in Elista.

896
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:34,160
 Mars, incorporated are one of the biggest pet food companies in America. They might be the

897
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:41,040
 biggest, actually. And they make beef stroganoff for pets, for dogs, specifically. Why didn't they

898
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,560
 call it beef dog enough? Because that would be, like, cannibalism. Yeah, that's confusing.

899
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,080
 You don't want to eat, like, an Andy Lasagna, do you?

900
00:36:52,080 --> 00:37:05,760
 But they use Tigray and Murray. Anyway, these kind of things, they make $100 million in annual sales,

901
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,920
 these kind of human-like pet foods. Wow, that's so weird. I really want to verify this. There are

902
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,280
 books on chess history that say that Charles Martel, who was Charlemagne's grandfather,

903
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,880
 is a person who invented human chess originally in the world. And they claim that he played a

904
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,320
 game of living chess, I think, in the eighth century, when he was at war with Arab forces and they

905
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,840
 introduced chess to them. And he had his servants play it. If anyone has any first-hand evidence

906
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,800
 that happened, I'd really enjoy reading it. First-hand evidence.

907
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:43,600
 I want Charles Martel's exact words. This is actually one really old guy in every French village

908
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:49,440
 who was part of that game. My grandfather was a pawn.

909
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:59,440
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to
